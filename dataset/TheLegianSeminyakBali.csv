0,Staff are amazing,50,April 2023,"We loved this hotel , the staff could not do enough for you . Breakfast ,you could have anything you wanted and my omelettes were always cooked perfectly- loved the free afternoon tea touch the kids enjoyed trying all the little cakes .for the first time in years the bed we had in our 2 bed suite was just right ( no my name is not Goldilocks 😃) ate lunch almost everyday which was pricey but lovely ,with plenty of restaurants outside we always went out for dinner so didn’t try the evening menu at the hotel .
We went on to Ubud for a few more days and we did say the hotel staff weren’t a patch on The Legian staff . Would definitely stay here again .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1,Second stay at The Legian in 3 months - fantastic hotel!,40,May 2023,"It was our second time at The Legian in just 3 months. The F&B service level is very high, as well as the food quality. Overall the facilities are very good and the rooms are extremely cleaned and well sized.
There are however two points which they need to improve:
- opening gym hours: it closes at 7pm, which is unacceptable for a 5* hotel of this level (closing time should be around 10pm);
- there is no alignment between the accounting department and the concierge staff: in both trips they included in our final bill at check-out time the night charges which were fully paid at check-in time (as they asked us to pay as soon as we arrived at the hotel). I honestly do not understand how this has happened in 2 different occasions, as it is quite disappointing from a guest point of view.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
2,Seminyak private retreat,50,April 2023,"My first impression of this hotel is so fantastic. I walked around and realized all of the suites are ocean views, the interior is authentic of Bali. All of the interiors are symmetrical and I am pretty sure is timeless because I was informed that this hotel is exist since 1996. I watched the sunset in front of the room and be so beautiful.

The hotel felt so private and all of the staff was also really helpful. For sure I will back again to this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

4,Amazing and Delightful,50,April 2023,"We had an incredible stay at The Legian. Hans and Rico should be very proud of their team who were so incredibly delightful. Everyone was friendly and welcoming, everyone knew our name and met us with a smile and everyone was happy to accommodate any request with minimum fuss. From the moment we were met at the airport until we dropped back at the airport, we could not have been happier. We're already planning our return trip(s), maybe one with our 2 children and another one just for us. THank you for a wonderful holiday!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
5,Wonderful welcoming staff- great drinks,50,April 2023,"We are staying elsewhere in Bali and decided to go to one of the popular beach clubs for early evening drinks /sunset in seminyak - it was noisy and we were told had no availability apart from a few uncomfortable looking spots
We decided to walk along the beach and then saw the legian - we asked if we could have a drink at the bar
What a wonderful warm welcome - impeccable service with genuine smiles
Great drinks and snacks and that view !
The manager was walking round chatting to guests including us and was just as welcoming when we said we had only popped in for a drink and were not residents
Thankyou for your hospitality",The Legian Seminyak Bali
6,Amazing stay - Easter holidays,50,April 2023,"The Legian Seminyak is amazing. My husband had never been to Bali previously and it took a bit on convincing to get him to go. Before we even checked out he asked when do we think we can come back.
From the moment we stepped out of our car we were greeted by our names and the staff already knew the names of our kids. We stayed in a 2 bedroom ground floor suite as a family of four (2 children 3 and 5 years old) following a few nights in Ubud. While the rooms feel slightly older, they are huge, immaculately clean and the service is impeccable. Serviced a couple of times a day at a time that suited us.
Food was wonderful including the Friday night seafood buffet. We didn't have a bad meal once and the food from the restaurant, pool bars and rooms service was all very good.
We both used the spa facilities and the treatments were fantastic and it was heavenly having a treatment room that faced the ocean.
Our children loved the kids club program that included gardening, cooking, jewelry and offering making. By the end of our trip the kids were leaving us at the pool and running over to the kids club where they would be greeted with outstretched arms. The staff were so good that we left our remaining local currency for the kids club staff as a token of our appreciation. They really helped us to be able to have a relaxing holiday.
The rooms could definitely do with a revamp at some stage however on balance with the world class the service, the great food, perfect ocean views and lovely pool and gardens, The Legian represents very good value when compared to other hotels. We were shocked at how reasonable the bill was on check out for how much we had consumed and enjoyed.
The location is also very good if you feel like shopping or strolling up the beach to other restaurants.
Following our week at the Semiyak we travelled to Singapore to stay in another 5 star global chain. The experience and service wasn't a patch on the Legian Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
7,Perfection,50,April 2023,"From the very first moment you arrive, you can tell that this place is special. You will immediately realise why all the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. The hotel is private and the staff are very attentive - everyone seems to address you by your name from the get-go.

I cannot fault this place
There was not a single disappointing part of the hotel and the team were accomodating enough to let me use the hospitality sweet to freshen up before my 7pm flight out

Don’t think about it. Just book it",The Legian Seminyak Bali
8,5 star rating is just UNDERstated !,50,April 2023,"May not be the newest property but still very beautifully maintained, and the location is just superb as in front of the seminyak beach coastline. Highligthing here that we really felt very welcomed and at home during our stay, which we had never felt before in other luxury resort we had stayed in Bali. Believe that this is due to under the leadership of Hans, this resort does make a big difference. Cant thank you enough for your prompt assistance to solve the possible glitch during my reservation. Kudos. Wishing Hans and the LGM team the bestest wishes",The Legian Seminyak Bali
9,The best hotel in Bali.,50,April 2023,"Still the best hotel in Bali.
Service, location and ambience are all unbeatable!
The staff are all delightful and it’s wonderful to return to this hotel and always see familiar faces.
My simplest description of The Legian hotel Seminyak is ‘well defined luxury’.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
10,Perfect in every way…,50,March 2023,We stayed here for five nights and absolutely loved it.The Villa was just perfection we were so sad to leave.The whole team are absolutely wonderful and nothing is too much trouble.We stayed in the club which was so quiet and private.Gita our butler was wonderful and attentive.Highly recommend and we will for sure return.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
11,Best place in Bali,50,April 2023,"This place was fantastic. Everything from the rooms, staff, and the food. The place was very clean and organized. We received spa treatments and they were the best we had in years. This is highly recommended",The Legian Seminyak Bali
12,A proper 5 star hotel,50,April 2023,"First class service from the moment we were picked up at the airport!

We had an amazing time at The Legian. Family of 4 with teens (14 and 12) stayed for 6 nights and wished it had been longer!

From the moment we arrived, close to midnight, all the staff were brilliant, even welcoming us on first name basis when we arrived. We had arranged room service for our late arrival and the food arrived bang on time. The 2 bedroom suite was beautiful with a view of the beach and pools.

The spa was a highlight for me, the treatment and setting made it a real experience. Highly recommend.

Everything was brilliant, I wish I could remember the some of the stand out staff, but they were all so good it would be unfair.

When we come back to Bali we will re book and we will be recommending to friends and family.

Thank you for such an amazing stay",The Legian Seminyak Bali
13,The Legian - simply the best!,50,April 2023,"We just stayed at The Legian for 6 days over the Easter holiday.
It's my first time back in Bali after several years and I feel The Legian is even better as it was before. And it was already outstanding some years ago!
It's been a wonderful experience from the arrival all the way to the departure. The smiles which greet you every day are just amazing. The Legian team does an amazing job for whatever it touches. The Restaurant served great meals throughout the day in excellent quality. The restaurant team did an amazing service, highly skilled with authentic smiles no matter how busy the place was during the Easter days.
The poolside / beach front bar is another highlight, especially during the sunset time which is absolutely magical from that viewpoint.
We booked serval spa treatments and again it's been wonderful.
What we noticed very quickly after our arrival is that almost no plastic is being used throughout the hotel which is such a rare sight in many other hotels. Also, most of the food ingredients are locally sourced.
All in all, The Legian made our Bali holiday a fantastic one and we shall be back for sure rather sooner than later.
It's an amazing property with its mature gardens and the ocean view along with the beach are just perfection.
But what makes all of this so special is the people who work at The Legian and shine day in day out.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
14,Perfection - not to be missed,50,April 2023,"There’s only one word to describe this hotel - perfection. The stand out has to be the impeccable service. The staff are a credit to not only the hotel but the hospitality industry in general. The personal touches are astonishing.

The location is great. Lots on your doorstep. Nice beach but huge waves and rips so the attentive life guard is a must. The kids loved bodyboarding with their dad. The sunsets are also simply stunning.

The hotel is understated luxury. The best sun loungers we’ve ever had. Very comfortable and again attentive service. You feel utterly relaxed. A real home from home.

Our 2 bed suite was incredible. It was huge and again the detail is exceptional including Bose surround sound system with pre loaded playlists and complimentary drinks and snacks.

Our spa treatments were fabulous. I’d highly recommend the Legian Indulgence.

The concierge service were super helpful. Nothing is too much trouble generally at the hotel.

Great food and drinks. Abundant breakfast choice and such a treat to have table service for the hot food. No queuing around a hot egg bar at this place!

I could continue a long list of praise for this hotel but will end by saying thank you to what really is well and truly a leading hotel of the world 🙏.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
15,The Legian Seminyak not to be missed,50,April 2023,"Some say Bali is very relaxing with amazing views, food and service. The Legian Seminyak is all that are more.
Beautiful large rooms with sea views, five star service and friendly staff. An amazing getaway.

Hans and his team treat you to a personalised five star experience that will bring you back time and time again.

Thank you for an amazing break and the chance to unplug.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
16,Outstanding resort deserving more than 5 stars! ars!,50,March 2023,"We have stayed in many places in a number of continents. None can compare to The Legian. If a 1,000 things need attention, the staff at the Legion did every one of them just right. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff is outstanding. The hotel itself may not appear to be glitzy but it does not need to, because it simply has class. We had a corner suite and the decor and amenities must be seen and experienced to really appreciate them. We also liked the beach in Seminyak at lot better than in Nusa Dua where we had stayed for a week. Five stars are insufficient for this resort. Highly and unreservedly recommended!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
17,Fantastic end to our Bali vacation with young children,50,March 2023,Immaculate service from arrival to check-out. The hotel arranged for a private room to shower and change before our flight back to Dubai. We travelled with two young children (5 and 2) and the attention to detail from the staff was incredible which really made for a fantastic end to our Bali trip. Hotel offering is high quality in particular the green spaces and pools and we will return to this hotel when we next visit Bali.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
18,Somewhat disappointed,30,March 2023,"I’m a regular at the Legian and have always enjoyed the service, the standard of the villas and all that comes with this resort. Having just stayed with a friend and appreciate that this is pose COViD we had a very mixed experience. The resort is very tired and our Deluxe Suite had evidence of building works such has falling plaster and debris an and several faults with the sewerage . The resort is undergoing significant upgrade works which has substantially reduced its capacity and some services, however this was not disclosed when booking services or when we stayed which isn’t transparent to its guests. Also there was significant smoking and vaping in areas and the hotel’s policy on this needs to be more clearly disclosed. Gym was ok but limited evident hygiene to wipe down equipment.

We really appreciated the extended late checkout however overall the Legian needs to do better to deliver the customer experience that one should expect of a 5 star resort.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
19,"The best hotel in Seminyak, Bali.",50,March 2023,"This hotel is absolutely the best. The rooms are big and comfortable. Everybody from the staff is kind, helpful and friendly. The food is outstanding. The location is perfect facing the beautiful ocean. Finally, the pool area and the garden are simply beautiful as well. My best recommendations.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
20,Amazing time off,50,March 2023,"The whole experience at The Legian Seminyak was so amazing, thanks to Spa Manager Suvendra & his team I enjoyed one of the best spa experience. The massage was really relaxing.
Congratulations to the entire team, you‘re wonderful.
Staying at the Club by Legian in a private villa with pool, what a magnificent stay…wow.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
21,A Balinese experience to remember,50,March 2023,"We had a wonderful stay in the Joglo Club Villa at the Legian Seminyak, Bali. The Joglo Club Villa is a stunning centuries-old Javanese temple of elaborately carved and painted teak wood overlooking a pool, flanked by two large bedrooms with lounges on each side. The Legian club villas are like a private and tranquil oasis with access to the main resort and its beach across the street. The hotel and club are also just a short stroll away from the lively streets, shops, and restaurants of Seminyak. The hotel and its grounds are immaculately kept and the staff is gracious and thoughtful. Swi took amazing care of us from the moment we arrived throughout our entire stay, helping create a perfect Balinese experience for our family. The members of the staff at the hotel were all truly kind, helpful, and knowledgeable. We have been to Bali several times before and have always preferred resorts that preserve the character and style of traditional Bali. We have stayed at the beautiful Tugu Bali in Canggu and the classic Oberoi in Seminyak. These were both amazing hotels but neither can quite match the Legian Seminyak, Bali and especially the Legian Club Villas, which also maintains a cleaner beach than other hotels. We cannot recommend this resort highly enough and look forward to returning.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
22,Best ever Bali experience,50,March 2023,"The Legian is the most superb resort ever. Location is brilliant and we cannot rate the staff highly enough! Their attention to every detail is incredible. The amenities are fantastic and all the restaurants and bars serve up delicious food.

We cannot wait to go back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
23,One of the best,50,March 2023,"Simply superb - attention to detail in all aspects. The beautifully appointed rooms, with unlimited water and complimentary mini bar.
The service of all the staff was impeccable. This hotel sets the benchmark for service and facilities.
Congratulations and thank you",The Legian Seminyak Bali
24,This is the only place to stay in Salmon yacht,50,March 2023,"This is the most luxurious resort that will pamper you from the moment you arrived moment you leave. Everything about this place exudes sophistication and luxury. The staff is so well trained. I was amazed how it everyone knew my name as they walked out the hotel and they greeted me by my name. Every time I would ask any staff for any favor they would always reply with “is there anything else”

The facilities are world-class. The architecture is Bolognese and welcoming. They have two cocktail lounges a five star restaurant with gorgeous sunset views. I would recommend booking a reservation for the sunset.

The hotel is literally on the beach and the pools are incredible. One is a lap pool. The other is an infinity pool, and There is also a kids pool.

The design of the pools and the gardens are relaxing to the eye, and it feels like a wellness center. The breakfast, which is served in a Buffay style both and Balinese foods. They have an eye for wellness serving only locally grown and healthy foods, fresh fruit juices, as well as a wellness drink

They also have a beautiful wellness center that includes cycling classes, yoga, etc.

A stay at this place is quite healing. Although they don’t bill it as a wellness center, it is in fact, a wellness center. Because everyone leaves feeling very refreshed and healed.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
25,Charming Bali Colonial,50,March 2023,"The old saying ‘Don’t Judge a Book by its cover’ certainly rings true here. Upon entering the reception it is another world of complete charm with possibly the best beach front location in Seminyak, and service to be admired… absolutely loved our stay here. Would highly recommend!!
Try and get the 2nd floor (top) to take advantage of the best Bali Sunsets",The Legian Seminyak Bali
26,All time favourite In Seminyak,50,February 2023,"This place is an all time favourite in Seminyak. It’s very well maintained throughout. We arrived early and our suite was ready and looked spectacular, as always. They closed off one side of the property for maintenance and kept the other side and public areas fully operational, so that no one was disturbed at all by any of the ongoing work.
The breakfast is a mix of smaller buffet stations plus a very extensive menu that could easily get you through the entire day. All staff at the property is the most professional, sincerely friendly and display so much pride working there.
During rainy season the ocean on the Seminyak side is known to throw back stuff onto the beach, which was even more through some stormy days. The Legian had about 5 or 6 people continuously on their long stretch of beach front, to keep it immaculately clean during those days and made their property really stand out against their neighbors.
On our day of departure, all rooms in operation were booked, so that we handed back our room keys after breakfast. With an early evening flight departure, we were using their pool and facilities throughout the day and were offered an hour in a hospitality lounge to shower, get changed and have a drink under the AC before heading back home. This made it a very comfortable late afternoon departure that made any late check out completely unnecessary.
I always find it annoying, especially in a place where the staff makes sure there’s enough loungers and umbrellas for everyone, there’s still people that can’t seem to refrain from space hogging. Here there were inconsiderate couples that reserved for example the only operational Bale with 360 shade as early as 9am during breakfast with a shirt and some hotel slippers, yet didn’t care to return to it until lunch or just removed their stuff again after some hours when they changed their mind without even using for a second. In all that time someone else could have had the pleasure using it (for a change), but apparently exactly this prime space was extremely important to them. The Legian should maybe better instruct their teams to support guests that are leaving belongings behind for a longer time, to remove and store them on their behalf for safekeeping.
Seminyak is a very popular and busy stretch of beach, with plenty of excellent restaurants nearby. Within that hustle and bustle The Legian really stands out by offering a place of incredible serenity at an extensive space facing a long stretch of beachfront.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
27,Elegance by the Sea,50,March 2023,"The Legian has a great location which includes a beautiful beach. The 3 infinity pools that cascade toward the sea create a lovely image which can be enjoyed from the pool bar or the lovely dining room. The service we received was impeccable and offered with friendliness and grace. Our room was delightful.

The spa is lovely. The massages on offer were wonderful. The 2-hour 4-hand special message is beyond wonderful. The masseuses are skillful and dedicated. They put their heart into it.

The breakfast was sumptuous and delightful. We were not quite as taken with the dinner options but the wait staff was eager to make it a good experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
28,Short family trip to Seminyak,50,February 2023,"We had an excellent stay with our 1 year old at this lovely oceanside hotel. Rico and the hotel staff team really went above and beyond to make us feel special, provide us with an outstanding suite and even baked us a cake for our special occasion.
We would highly recommend this hotel as an individual or couple seeking a wellness break as well as a family on a short break. The seafood grill on Fridays is excellent (as well as all the meals we had at the hotel restaurant)!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
29,PARADISE FOUND!,50,February 2023,"My 5th visit to Bali, my husband's 1st so it had to be good!! And he wasn't disappointed & nor should he be. The Legian Hotel was amazing, from our suite to the pool attendants, beach cleaners (who work tirelessly every day to keep the beach pristine), the fabulous food in the restaurant & bar not to mention the afternoon tea - all incredible. The staff are very welcoming & can't do enough for you, nothing is too much trouble. The 3 pools were a welcome sight every day & a beautiful place to sit overlooking the ocean, we enjoyed massages & a facial in the spa, (one of the best massages we've had), all in all our stay was fabulous! Thanks to Rico & his team of incredible employees, hard not to return to this oasis :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
30,AS USUAL ALMOST INCOMPARABLE,50,January 2023,"We have been at THE CLUB for the 5th or 6th time and we knew what to expect. No disappointments at all. The contrary is the case. However we made the ""mistake"" to bring our 15 month old daughter who was just starting to explore the world on her own feet, and we had to accept that The Club is not really the right choice in such a particular case. In the villa as well as in the lounge where we had afternoon tea or dinner there are too much steps which caused us a lot of stress to avoid that our daughter could omit these ""traps"". Also some uncovered spotlight in the walls at the lounge which are developing a very big heat and could have caused burnings when being touched. hence we had a lot to do to run after her rather than to sit back, relax, and enjoy. We did also miss a ramp here and there to make out life easier with our stroller. As mentioned we do not blame The Legian at all for that, and everybody, particularly our Butler Eka, was happy to assist, but we should not have come with a little girl who is not yet save on her own feet. When we have been there in April 2022 she was hardly able to crawl what caused us less headache. Otherwise we did enjoy or stay as in the past and we will definitly come back when our daugther must not always see her parents ruinning after her and being close to heartattacks... ;-)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
31,Worth of its epic reputation,50,February 2023,"An oasis in the chaos of Seminyak, old school vibes, superlative service, incredible suites and the pool is very chilled and luxurious. The wellness centre, spa, yoga and other amenities really add bang for your buck. Every part of the hotel just works. We will be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
32,Fantastic stay at The Legian Seminyak,50,February 2023,"We have been at The Legian Seminyak in 2019, before the pandemic, and returned now in February 2023. It was equally fantastic! The team, the management, everybody is perfectly welcoming, kind and professional!
We will be back...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
33,Excellent lunch for one,50,February 2023,"I visited here today for lunch and had the catch of the day, being the Barramundi fish. It was prepared, cooked and presented to perfection and was delicious.

The service was top as well, with the staff being very welcoming and friendly. I wouldn’t hesitate to dine here again.

See you soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
34,Romantic getaway,50,February 2023,"As part of being an airline captain I have had the privilege to stay at some beautiful properties around the world in my travels. This is an outstanding hotel in all respects. Service was faultles, food outstanding and comfort 5 star on all levels. Well done Nico and his team.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
35,The best hotel we have stayed ever!!,50,February 2023,"We stayed at the Legian for 3 nights. It’s absolutely the best hotel we have ever stayed! We tried three hotels with different styles in Bali. The Legian is more like an old-fashioned (?) but grand one. Staff are super friendly and always with smiles on! And you would feel like being welcomed in EVERY corner!

We actually encountered a little problem during the first night as I couldn’t sleep well because of some music coming from nowhere (I am super sensitive to sound) The staff arranged us to sleep at the next suite immediately and upgraded us to a more quiet suite the next day. Really appreciate it and this didn’t ruin my mood at all.

Food is great there but not many choices compared to other hotels we stayed. We tried Baliness Massage of 60mins and 90mins one. SUPER GOOD AND PLEASE DO TRY THE 90MINS one.

For service, it’s truly beyond words. Special thanks to Dewi from the concierge team. She gave a lot of advice to me.

In short, we highly recommend you to stay at the Legian and experience what I mentioned above. Will definitely come back on day!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
36,Total perfection!,50,February 2023,"Our four night stay was nothing short of perfection! The location is absolutely wonderful with the shops, restaurants and bars on your doorstep. Step outside of the front of the hotel and your in the heart of it - stay within the hotel and you have the most idyllic beachfront sanctuary.

This is the most relaxing hotel with spacious beautifully appointed rooms, lush immaculate gardens and wonderful facilities such as the gym and spa.

The atmosphere is exquisite and the whole staff team are gentle, kind, friendly whilst discrete... absolutely nothing is too much trouble.

We are returning guests and absolutely love the wonderful restaurants within the hotel. Breakfast is absolutely sensational. Elegant and sophisticated menu with everything you could ever wish for, really fresh produce, many items cooked fresh to order with immaculate service.

We also loved the afternoon tea (complimentary) and the gorgeous cocktails served poolside. One of our highlights was the fabulous Indonesian menu, which consisted of a fabulous tasting menu some items served over charcoal at the table... when you have food and an ambience like this then why go anywhere else!

Novita cared for us from the moment we checked in to our departure... she is amazing. It was also an absolute pleasure to meet Eddie who looked after us so beautifully along with his team in the restaurant. If you're considering this hotel... Don't look any further - you won't regret it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
37,Best place to stay in Bali,50,January 2023,"We stayed for 6 nights in a private villa and had an exquisite experience with an exceptional service!!!

Dedek, our butler, should be given an award!

Ambience is very authentic and location very convenient. The pic up/ drop off service to airport and within Seminyak, made moving around very convenient.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
38,"Truly Five Star Luxury, never disappoints. Ever.",50,July 2022,"The Legian under the GM Hans is absolutely outstanding. The team are back and so is the resort. like Covid never happened. It was so good to be back again after the two year Covid lockdown finally lifted. An extra pool has been added seamiessly too The staff are what makes this beautiful resort even more incredible. I have have had the pleasure of visiting this resort for over twenty years and I am happy to say, that nothing changes. It is always superb. If I ever run away from home, I have always said, this is where you will lind me. I cannot fault The Legian. Special mention to the fabulous pool bar staff Budi and his ever smiling friend that run the pool area too. They make it even more relaxing with their on the bail service and oversight of guests cannot wait to retum!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
39,Magnificent,50,January 2023,"The best way I can describe my experience is with a simple example.

Every morning, Hans, the hotel manager would visit the restaurant to greet all the guests at breakfast. I couldn't help but notice that his shirt and trousers were immaculate; not a crease on them.

What this says to me is that Hans attends to his guests before he has even sat down himself at the start of his day.

That level of customer care and attention pervades through the whole hotel and all the staff.

I'm a very satisfied guest and I'll surely be back again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
40,"Awesome service, top notch hotel",50,January 2023,"We used to stay in 5 stars branded hotels in Bali like four seasons, W hotel, grand Hyatt and The Legian is by far the best. Wonderful service which we didn’t get in other branded hotels. For instance the first day we had issues lowering the Venetian wooden blinds and called home keeping for assistance, they came in a team of 5! They helped us with lowering all our venitian shades and at the same time clean up our rooms, exchange new towels. We were blown away with the service. We had a deluxe room with a living room and stayed with 2 kids. The room is spacious enough for kids to roam around. Room is very clean and hotel is very quiet for relaxing. Luxurious hotel and will be back again.

If there is any improvement we can think of is just the Venetian wooden shades, it’s really hard to lower or raise it due to the weight. Quality of the shades can be improved tho and if they can change it to motorization/automated wooden shades that would be so so awesome. We still had issues lowering or raising the shades during the duration of our stays and chose to just ignore it. The entrance to the room can be improved by using cards instead of keys tho. Have to keep the keys around which is a bit annoying. Otherwise super awesome hotel and will be back again! This is better than W hotel, try it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
41,Coming Home,50,January 2023,"The Wald family our greeted home from the minute we arrive at the Legian.

Our holiday was a family affair to celebrate my husband’s 60th birthday.

When our dear friend Agung picks us up at the airport we are greeted at our arrival by Hans the general manager who makes sure our holiday is perfect in every way.Thank you Hans.

I would like to mention every one from Dewi and Catherine at concierge who go above and beyond to organise our every day booking to all the staff in the restaurant and around the pool thanks Budi.
Nothing is too much trouble.
The Legian is a perfect place to spend time for any occasion.

44,Magnificant hotel with wonderful staff,50,January 2023,"We spent 3 nights in Villa 4 in the club. We had the most wonderful time being looked after by Dikka our villa butler we was constantly available to help with whatever we needed. It was lovely being in the club as it was quieter than the main hotel however if you wanted a bit more buzz you could go over to the hotel, use the facilites and have that amazing ocean view.

The food and service were top notch, the staff were really friendly and the rooms were stunning. We will be going back, thank you guys for a wonderful stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
45,"Absolutely wonderful experience at The Legion, a truly memorable vacation",50,January 2023,"We visited Bali en route from Singapore to Australia and selected the Legian for our stay based on a recommendation from another family member. Everything went perfectly on arrival from pick up at the Airport to check in with a nice cocktail. The room and facilities were excellent and the service was outstanding. Food was great, and spa facilities were very relaxing. Overall a wonderful experience and we can fully recommend this hotel as one of the best we have ever stayed in.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
46,Style and quality,50,January 2023,"Perfekt location on the beach,1st 3 great swimming pools, elegant buildings, well trained and very polite staff, restaurant facing the sea and perfect for watching the sunset. High quality spa. This luxury hotel is expensive, however",The Legian Seminyak Bali
47,Totally restorative,50,January 2023,"This was our second time to Bali. This time we decided to stay on the beach in Seminyak. We were underprepared for how exceptional The Legian is. We stayed in a studio with a sea view. The service, the view, the pools all incredible and balm for the soul. We rarely return to a place where we have stayed but this time we will. As a hard working couple, this place provided a space for total relaxation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
48,Amazing stay at the Club Legian,50,December 2022,"We stayed at the one bedroom villa at the Club, which is just across the street from the Legian. The villas are beautiful and the service is top notch. The inclusions in the villa on the club side make it worth it. We had our butler Dika who was amazing, he truly worked very hard for us to have a memorable experience which we did. The gym and spa at the legian were very good, the gym had latest equipment and the steam and sauna were excellent. Been to Bali seminayk three times, stayed at the Samaya,the W and the legian. By far Legian is top notch and next time when I am in Bali again will stay at the Legian. Our butler Dika was excellent and we already miss him.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
49,Sunset dinner,50,January 2023,"Went there for dinner and watch the sunset . Excellent dinner and service. Most amazing view of the sunset . Customer service was 10/10. Will definitely stay there one day. Very close to many restaurants. Beach was clean and pool looked great
Haysam Mohtadi",The Legian Seminyak Bali
50,Back in our favourite place,50,January 2023,"Back for the first time since pre-covid in Bali and simply had to get back to the Legian. Totally tranquil, yet walkable to restaurants/bars/entertainment for the whole family. The surrounds of this hotel are as good as Seminyak has to offer.

It's Great to see so many of the staff have been retained post lockdowns etc (understanding some of the 5* hotels chose not to do the same).

The food was great, service impeccable and we just love our time there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
51,Our private Oasis in Bali,50,December 2022,"From the moment we stepped off the plane to the return trip to the airport (so sad to leave) the team at The Legian Seminyak - Club Villas provided a real 5-Star experience and level of service that goes above and beyond. We stayed 2 times in 2 weeks and even extended or last stay to experience all The Club and their staff had to offer. One week is not enough. A special thanks to our butlers Mr. Bona and Ms. Yoni, our OG driver Mr. Suma and the entire Club staff (chef & bartenders). Ricco, Hans and the entire team made our time seamless between both the The Club and Oceanfront hotel side. Best of both worlds. We loved the experience and private Oasis feeling in the heart of an active Seminyak so much we planned to return again in August 2023....See you guys soon:)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
52,"A serene, superb experience",50,December 2022,We were on our way to a diving trip and wanted to stay relatively close to the airport. This boutique hotel is an oasis of calm in a very lively area. You can access all the shopping and nightlife you like but I’d encourage you to eat at the gorgeous and tasty restaurant. Service is discrete and absolutely top notch. I will be back!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
53,The best hotel I have every stayed at,50,December 2022,"Where to start,
I hadn’t been to Bali before and was a little nervous, when stepping off the plane we were greeted from concierge for the airport to get our fast visa and customs vip. Then we were handed to The Legian driver in a luxurious black van with cream leather recliners in the back and handed frangipani wet towels and a bottle of water. The driver was super friendly and made use feel comfortable.

Pulling up to the Legian (our home for the next week) was spectacular. The grounds are impeccable and the staff were the most attentive loving people I have ever met. They all remember your name room number, any food allergies were remembered every time we ordered it was very impressive. The rooms are beautiful and you feel so safe in the hotel.

Prime location, you walk right out the gate, cross the road then there is a ally to the shopping street.

Over all they are amazing, they go above and beyond at every step, we will be back August 2023 for 10 nights this time!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
54,Remarkably uncommon,50,October 2022,"Remarkably uncommon!

We’ve been to Legian Hotel for a couple times and loved it. Booking a Club Villa on separate annex was daunting and we were left questioning ourselves, ‘why risk?’

Best decision ever - butler service, our butler Yanni was superior is all aspects. She remember things I struggle to recall and every request was never too much for her.

Polite, kind, attentive and etc are words to describe Yanni.

Thank you to Ngurah and team for the sensational service too!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
55,AMAZING!,50,December 2022,"All I can say is ‘WOW’. The service, the people, the rooms, the breakfast, the afternoon tea, everything was amazing. The tranquil setting makes it hard to leave. Rico, the manager, spoke to us twice during our stay and was a lovely man. It is obvious he really cares about what the guests think. We did not swim in the pool which was the only one thing which was disappointing. It was 29 degrees so too warm to swim in for us with the heat of Bali in December but that’s only a small thing and really didn’t impact our stay. We were happy to lounge on the pool deck chairs soaking in the ocean views. We were offered to use the hospitality suite as our flight was late at night. Just another thing where the service was impeccable. Treated like royalty. We will most definitely be back! Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
56,A holiday of a lifetime,50,December 2022,"We stayed 12 nights in our own villa within the hotel's Club area .....a small number of villas with their own exclusive facilities, but with full access to the hotel and spa, restaurant, pools and beach just a few hundred metres away to give us the best of both worlds! The villa itself was very well equipped with its own pool, minibars, outdoor bath etc., but the best part was having our own butler who looked after us for everything we needed ... thanks so much Merta, you are an absolute star! In fact all of the staff and management at The Club and hotel itself were superb. Overall a fantastic stay and I would wholeheartedly recommend The Legian for a holiday in Bali and for a extra special treat take a villa at The Club",The Legian Seminyak Bali
57,Fabulous!!! A must stay!!!,50,December 2022,"Our stay at the Club Legian was outstanding. This was our first trip since the pandemic and was exactly what we needed. In the lead up to our holiday, we had a number of questions regarding configuration of the villa, pick up / transfer from the airport and some minor queries about the inclusions during our stay – all of these questions were answered as well as our requests being met and exceeded.

The start of our trip did not go to plan with Virgin cancelling our flight, all the stress of getting there was quickly forgotten when we met at the airport by our Butler Nanda. We arrived late (midnight) to the resort and were shown to our villa – which was incredible! It was extremely spacious and the inclusions in the room were phenomenal – a fully stocked mini bar both in the room and out by the pool, which was replenished each day (sparkling water, tonic, gin, coke zero, kombucha pretty well much everything you expect in a mini bar (including snacks)). The room had a great espresso machine which poured a strong tasty espresso. The villa was extremely well maintained and the housekeeping was of the highest standard with the room being made up at a minimum twice a day and towels being refreshed throughout the day. Anything that was needed was only a phone call away!

The villa is very private and is in a beautifully landscaped environment, the grass was lush and green, tropical trees by the pool, koi pond as well as the outdoor bath. The pool was a generous size and depth – 11m with a bench seat at the end so you can sit comfortably in the pool and cool off (ideally with a cocktail). The pool also received the sun but also had shade as well as the day beds alongside the pool which were also shaded.

The club also provides a daily laundry service – this was fantastic. Each day our laundry was collected and returned the following morning freshly washed and pressed! Breakfast was included in the club – we had the option of either picking what we would like and having it delivered to the villa or having it in the restaurant which again is in a beautiful setting by the infinity pool facing the beach! Win win really! Nothing was too much, each request we had was always met with a smile and was delivered on – gluten free bread, fresh mango juice for my son each morning as well as soy or almond milk for coffees.

The day spa was pure bliss. The setting of the rooms was amazing – the ambience was perfect for a relaxing massage. The rooms faced the ocean and the lush tropical surroundings. The quality of the massages (I had 3!) was wonderful. Each muscle was released and my stresses melted away! My son had his first massage which they made sure he was comfortable and was able to enjoy his experience. The wellness centre in the resort was incredible, I participated in a spin class which was taken by a brilliant instructor. In addition the gym in the hotel was well equipped and the equipment was in excellent condition.

The club also has the larger pool that can be used by all guests staying at the club – I loved that there were always refresher towels and chilled water was provided. (which were provided at the resort pool as well – which again you have the option of using, in front of the beach – great views, ocean breeze.

Afternoon tea was served every day and was a mini “high tea” with traditional Indonesian sweets, min sweet tarts and sandwiches – as well as coffee / tea or juice. It was a lovely way to enjoy the afternoon. Cocktail hour was great and was another wonderful inclusion in the club services – you had a choice of cocktails with canapes – which were amazing! I highly recommend the Legian Sunset! The staff were so warm and inviting, drinks were always refiled and canapés topped up! The food was outstanding and was so fresh!

The resort manager and the club manager were very engaging and regularly checking in and asking if they can do anything for us. We had a late flight home and we mentioned this to the club manager who very graciously gave us a complimentary late check out till 6pm!!! Which is unheard of! I was totally blown away by this generosity and kindness!

From the late check out to the complimentary massages by the pool, to the abundance of fresh food and hospitality I cannot recommend the Club at the Legian more highly! We had 7 nights and I wish we had have stayed for longer!! I cannot wait to go back!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
58,A brilliant hotel,50,December 2022,"A great 5 star retreat. Excellent swimming pools and great huge rooms with balconies. A very relaxing stay with amazing food for breakfast lunch afternoon tea and dinner! All the staff were very friendly, professional and provided exceptional personal service. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and didn't want to leave. We will be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
59,Amazing stay at the Legian.,50,December 2022,"At our stay in the Legian, we found the service from the staff extremely accommodating, and we had nothing to complain about. The staff work tirelessly to make sure everything is spot on.
The location was 10 out of 10. the pool/beach front was obsolete picture perfect sight every morning while we had the amazing breakfast from the restaurant.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
60,Outstanding,50,December 2022,"Where do I begin, wow,wow,wow!!! What a memorable experience that both myself and my husband will never forget. Our stay at the Legian Seminyak Club Villas was amazing. The staff are all so very helpful and friendly and make you feel so welcome from the moment you step in. Our butler Astika was tremendously wonderful.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
61,Never Fails to Delight,50,November 2022,"We absolutely loved our recent week in The Club at The Legian. The pandemic hasn’t fazed them - the hotel is in immaculate condition, and their perfect service remains as high as ever. We have no doubt that this is Bali’s finest resort hotel, which seamlessly blends the relaxed Bali experience with the stringent service delivery of great international luxury hotels.
A special shout-out to our butler Yoni, who was the icing on the cake of a perfect experience. Her wonderful proactivity and easy going nature enhanced our experience beyond belief. Take note, Legian Management, you have an absolute star here.
Thanks to all the crew at The Club - we had a fantastic time, and hope to see you all soon!
Peter & Angela W",The Legian Seminyak Bali
62,Beautiful beachfront resort,50,December 2022,"We stayed in a delux oceanfront suite - the rooms are large with a sep lounge area and a big balcony with a gorgeous view of the beach through the tree tops. At all times the staff were impressive - excuse me for forgetting names - we loved how each morning they just new our favourite daybed by the pool and it was ready and waiting for us!
We received a beautiful cake for our anniversary and a lovely card - The Legian truly goes the extra mile.
The spa was divine and the staff very experienced!
We checked out a few other local properties during dinners out but would pick this hotel for its staff, location and being traditional Indonesian rather than modern and hip! It was a sublime stay x",The Legian Seminyak Bali
63,Amazing place,50,December 2022,I stayed at the club Villas it was a beautiful villa and very comfortable.. service was over the top to be honest. The staff were very good and friendly. Highly recommended. Special thanks to Bona who made the stay very comfortable,The Legian Seminyak Bali
64,Superb,50,November 2022,The entire experience at the Legian is first class. We travelled with our one year old daughter and the staff we just amazing. They were so attentive and accommodating. They make you feel at home and we will definitely be back. Location and facilities are also fantastic.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
65,Amazing place and staff,50,November 2022,"We booked one of the villas for our honeymoon and it was the perfect place to land in Bali. They picked us up from the airport, and the rest of the stay was just so lovely and we felt so well taken care of. Astika, our butler was fantastic, checked in often with us, showed us around the hotel, helped us plan day trips. Suta was just the best, I looked forward to my morning meals just to see him. He took such good care of us and even prepped fruit snacks and water for us to enjoy on our day trip. When he heard we were visiting Sidemen next he offered tons of recommendations to us for spots to see. We met the manager and assistant manager who checked in with us as well, all lovely. All the staff was so nice and made our stay special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
66,True Gem on the Seminyak Beach,50,November 2022,"Just had a wonderful stay here and would like to say big thank you to all staffs we encountered for their warm Balinese hospitality with great professionalism. It seemed that they knew our names or schedules after day 1 and provided personalised help whenever we needed it. It felt like being on a small luxury cruise line on land.

Beach-front is magnificent hearing the big waves and loved the relaxing vibes at the resort-gamelan during the day and jazz in the evenings.

One slight issue we had was musty smell and slightly damp bedding in the suite. Not sure if it’s only our suite’s or rainy season issue(was raining quite a bit).
We are sure hotel would have dealt with it promptly if we raised the issue but since it was short 2N stay, we just left it.

We still definitely will come back to the Legian in near future as it is such a relaxing place with one of the best services in Bali. Thank you",The Legian Seminyak Bali
67,Worst hotel I have been to in Bali,10,January 2022,"This is the worst hotel I have ever been to in Bali. Beyond the natural friendliness of the Balinese people, the hotel is old and dated. Lobby was dark. Their pools are located in one area, so adults and children's pools are close to each other. The room was outdated and my bed was stained with something that looked like blood (we stayed at the suite). There were stains in the bathroom. The beach was dirty and not as big as other hotels'. We were restricted from swimming at the beach because the waves was too high, it was restricted for the whole 5 days duration of our stay. For the room price they are charging, you could easily stay at better hotels in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
68,"exceptional hotel, great service, lovely people, very good food and perfect position",50,November 2022,"We had a wonderful 5 nights in this hotel. The service was phenomenal, great people and food. Concierge and reception team went out of their way to help
Hotel is in the ideal position in the beach
Spa and treatment facilities are high quality
All round perfect, couldn't fault it",The Legian Seminyak Bali
69,Best Service I’ve Ever Had,50,November 2022,"I’ve never left a hotel review for any vacation, but I feel compelled to write one for the Legian because of how spectacular our experience was. First of all, the hotel is beautiful and the location couldn’t be more perfect. It is right on the beach next to some of the best restaurants, bars, and beach clubs in Seminyak. We stayed here as part of our honeymoon, and this hotel was by far the best place we stayed during our trip (we also stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Nusa Dua, and even that didn’t compare to the Legian). We spent five nights at the Legian and stayed in a one bedroom private pool villa in The Club. Our favorite part of our stay was our personal butler, Nanda, who was extremely attentive to all of our needs. From booking restaurant reservations and excursions to making sure our villa was extremely clean and taken care of, he went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect. We could have easily spent our entire honeymoon at the Legian and we would have had the most amazing trip. Thanks to the amazing staff for making us feel at home, we were extremely sad when we had to leave. Anyone who wants to visit Bali and asks for places to stay, this will hands down be at the top of my recommendations. If we have the chance to come back to Bali, we will 100% be staying here again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
70,A wonderful hotel,50,November 2022,"We had a fantastic stay for 8 nights at The Legian. The hotel just oozes style, sophistication and serenity.
The staff were amazing. They addressed us by our name and were happy, courteous and always willing to help
Our room was spacious, stylish and was serviced at least twice a day to a very high standard.
The breakfast was delicious, made to order, and always beautifully presented.
The hotel has a perfect beachfront location.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
71,TRUE 5 STAR LUXURY IN SEMINYAK,50,November 2022,"On a month long trip to Bali staying at 5 star resorts . The Legian Seminyak was at every level one of the finest properties I stayed in . From the pickup at our previous hotel by Eka , to our delivery at our next destination also by Eka, the Legian delivered the highest level of luxury , attentiveness, quality and professionalism. The entire staff from front desk, food servers, beach and pool attendants, house keeping went so far above and beyond our expectations to make our stay memorable in every way .Eka who was our butler at Legian Club where our villa was located, was so incredible. His warmth and knowledge and assistance in planning every detail of our stay was beyond any accolades I might describe . We have been to the Maldives and Bora Bora where we thought the butlers were fantastic but no one was on par with Eka
He made us feel like family and will be in our hearts forever . The managers introduced themselves and over our stay repeatedly followed up to make sure we were happy and attended to .
I enjoyed the Legian so much that I extended our 6 night stay to 7 nights . As a picky eater the restaurants were so accommodating to customize the dishes to make me happy . The food was so exceptional that in our entire stay we only left the property once to try a local restaurant.
The sunset at the pool bar overlooking the beach was sensational.
As a seasoned traveler I found it hard to pick a hotel in Seminyak because of the abundance of 5 Star properties . After our stay at Legian and visiting some of the other properties there was no doubt that I picked the perfect and best choice . As soon as I’m back in the states I will start working on a return trip to Legian and bring my children and grandchildren",The Legian Seminyak Bali
72,Back to Bali,50,November 2022,"The Legian was one of my favorite hotels during my one week stay in Bali. My boyfriend and I stayed here for five days and everyday we had such a bliss. Especially the hospitable, friendly and helpful staff who made sure that all of our needs were always met! We also got upgraded to a one bedroom suite on the ground floor with easy access to the restaurants and pool! The room was marvelous and spacious, we love the decor and ambiance. Timeless & classic!

I absolutely romanticized the infinity pool overlooking the ocean, especially during breakfast (where we savored great food selections) and also during sunset when the fire was lit up at the stone urns at the far corners! The direct access to the beach was very convenient for us to take morning or sunset walk. The hotel is located close by many attractions in the Seminyak area.

I also loved the fact that the hotel hosted morning and evening wellness classes (various yoga, pilates, spinning class, etc.) with experience and certified instructors. Thanks to Pak Wayan Marcus, Putu Herlambang and Mba Putri for helping me aligning my spine and chakras!

My favorite is the spa where I truly enjoyed the sauna and massage in a bale facing the ocean! Mba Suka was an absolute professional and knew how to untangle my knots!

We will absolutely come back! Thanks for the amazing experience!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
73,Loved the Hotel,50,November 2022,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for making our stay at The Legian so welcoming. This is one of the best hotel in Bali .

76,"Beautiful hotel, great service",50,October 2022,"We had a great stay at the Legian at a Deluxe Pool Villa at the Club. The room and private pool were so nice and it was great to be so close to the beach.

Our butler, Dedek, was also so great and made our stay even better than we could’ve imagined. He helped us book time at the spa, which was wonderful, and gave us recommendations for things to do in Seminyak.

If you’re considering a stay at the Legian, go ahead and book it. You will not regret it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Amazing sweet on the 3rd floor with views of the crashing sea.

The grounds and buildings are breathtaking.

Staff that we so pleased to offer first class service.

Very good food (we preferred to eat out in the eves so cannot comment on evening meals but they looked and smelt great and were very busy)

The Spa is great value and the free facilities top quality (staff there were also of the highest calibre)

Great sun beds, pools and beach (cleaned constantly )

Would definitely return",The Legian Seminyak Bali

82,Legian Seminyak - relaxing stay & beautiful staff,40,October 2022,"We had such a beautiful visit back to Bali. The staff at the Legian are so caring, attentive and lovely. It felt like we were part of the family. The only reason for not giving 5 stars was to indicate that it is an older style resort while still being luxurious. The breakfast pancakes are next level. The spa treatments are relaxing. The free yoga classes are challenging and a great way to start the day.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
83,Definitely the best hotel in Seminyak,50,September 2022,"My family and I spent 8 nights at the Legian in Sept. The location is great but what makes this property a luxury property is the attention to detail and the staff.

We have stayed many times over the past 10 plus years and its always the same- fantastic standard- food, staff, location, pools etc etc.
Whilst this property is not brass n' glass its balinese with all the mod-cons you would ever want.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
86,The Legian Hotel Seminyak Club,50,October 2022,"We had stayed in the main hotel in a family suite in 2019. This time we booked a villa in the club area. We were upgraded on arrival to a 2 bedroom villa. The hotel is truly world class. The surroundings, decor and facilities are exceptionally good. The staff and customer service are unique. We have never found a hotel that feels like this. The care and attention to detail are second to none. Special thanks to Swi and Loni for their excellent service.
The wonderful staff, ambience and food are so amazing, it is difficult to find the superlatives to describe them. We had top notch recommendations for local restaurants and ideas to keep us entertained. The GM Hans and the assistant managers were so welcoming and friendly and achieved the perfect mix of leaving us in peace and attention when we needed it. Equally, a day relaxing in the villa or by the ocean was just as amazing. We love the breakfast each morning, and we love the afternoon tea brought to you wherever you might be each afternoon in the hotel. This time we also had access to a driver and car whenever we needed it. We also had unlimited 'mini' bar, stocked with our favourite choices of soft drinks, snacks and alcohol. The cocktail hour in the club lounge was such a treat.
We felt so taken care of and we are already planning our next trip to this special hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Wish we had more of these hotels around and in the USA!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
89,Great Hotel in a great location,50,September 2022,"The Legian is a top class hotel. Location excellent, staff really great. Has an almost family feel about it, and I think benefits from not being a chain of hotels. I had a villa staying in the 'Club' which was excellent. I also extended my stay by a further 6 days",The Legian Seminyak Bali
90,The best hotel,50,October 2022,"The Legian Seminyak is in the best location. Really close to Seminyak square, near the best shops, restaurants and clubs. The staff here are next level friendly and helpful. The rooms are very luxurious as well. Overall a very very amazing hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
91,AMAZING 🤩,50,October 2022,"This was the most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed out, we have stayed all over the world and this was by far the best on every level.

93,Professional personal hospitality,50,October 2022,"Expectations were exceeded. Not one comfort was left out and everything was provided at the highest level of execution.

We were warmly greeted by the resort shuttle driver at the airport. They have a fleet of dark gray Mazda SUVs. Provided along the drive are scented clothes, water and Wi-Fi. It was about a 30ish minute drive to reach the resort.

We arrived early in the morning and were greeted promptly. An ice cold glass of sweet lemon grass water was provided. I wish this water was accessible the entire stay it was so good. Our room was not ready yet so we checked our bags with the staff and changed in the fitness center locker room. My wife headed to the pool and I grabbed one of their complimentary bicycles and headed out into town. It’s crazy out in the streets with lots…tons of traffic. I was the only bicycle on the road. I don’t recommend the ride unless you plan on joining in the mayhem and being aggressive.

My wife had ordered a few cocktails and an appetizer at the pool. She was highly pleased so over the course of our 4 day stay we ordered often from the pool area. The staff will help you prepare your pool chair, bring towels, fresh water and set your umbrella.

Our room was ready about 2pm which was earlier than expected which was awesome. The room itself…ridiculously nice. It was an authentic feel with a highly modern touch. 2 bathrooms, 1 shower, 1 bathtub, comfortable king bed and pillows, beautifully scented shower/bath amenities, several fresh bottles of water, 2 separate thermostats (living room and bedroom), bar snacks, fridge stocked (soda, kombucha, 2 beers, and granola bars) and fresh fruit with a variety changed daily.

I don’t know the exact count but I believe there are at least 3 turn down services throughout the day. The first in the late morning/early afternoon to tidy up, second late afternoon to replenish towels, refresh water and tidy up and third in the evening to draw the shades, bring a nighttime small pastry, drop off extra towels, tidy up and set a mosquito incense outside the entry door. I do also like the small incense they provide for the bedroom in the evening. It burns for about 10 minutes and is calming.

Breakfast is complimentary and I recommend waking up for it. Eggs are made fresh to order along with waffles, and other typical breakfast items. They chefs there prepare each item at an elevated level. There are a few option fresh fruit options, juices, yogurt, breads and some Indonesian dishes.

On the first morning during breakfast we were greeted by Hans. It was nice to see management expressing interest in guest’s experiences. We also met Rico Haus, the Resort Manager on a few occasions during our stay. He was super friendly and we shared a few stories about food and Thailand. I would say that both Rico and Hans are very fortunate to manage the Legian team as every member of their staff is very friendly, kind and caring. One evening we were headed out into town. Rico saw us in the lobby and provided a few recommendations and they were spot on. Mexicola and La Favala. He also said to call the resort if we found ourselves in trouble or lost and they would come and pick us up.

My wife and I travel out of country every October and have been doing so since 2009 to celebrate our anniversary. Rico, thank you for the hand written note and sending a cake to our room. We never stay at the same resort twice because we always try to experience variety. But I know that when we do come back to Bali we will be staying at The Legian.

Our flight was delayed on our last evening and there were no issues with us staying on resort and using the amenities which was nice and comforting. I am actually at the airport sitting in front of our gate now. We used the hotel shuttle service to be dropped off (paid service) which I would also recommend setting up. It’s more convenient and comfortable than a taxi.

Thanks - Kevin and Mari Frank",The Legian Seminyak Bali
94,Classic example of pure luxury and service.,50,September 2022,"Amazing place beautiful food and fantastic service. Never lets us down! We will be back again. Such a perfect holiday. Every detail taken care and made to feel so welcomed.
Sitting watching the sunset is amazing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
95,Brilliant Again,50,October 2022,"Time after time this place delivers.
Yoni the Butler was one of the highlights, extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble. She is a true asset to the hotel and I hope her bosses understand the value she adds to guests stays.
Over at the main hotel the breakfast is superb, everyone greets you by name and once again, nothing is too much trouble.
The pool staff are second to none, attentive without being overbearing in their presence.
Location is best in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
96,"Outstanding hotel, amazing service",50,September 2022,"We have just returned from an 8 night stay at the Club at The Legian. The villa was superb and every detail is well planned and thoughtful. The food was also outstanding (especially breakfast at the Club), but the exceptional feature in this hotel is the staff. Every single staff member we encountered was welcoming, smiling and brilliant at their job. A very special thanks to Yoni our butler, who anticipated our every needs and made our stay so special. We miss being pampered!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
97,Better than Ever!,50,September 2022,"I’ve been to The Legian a number of times over almost 20 years and every time it gets better. This visit was no exception. Everything was outstanding - especially the service! The food at dinner in the restaurant is superb and definitely rates as the best in Seminyak! The staff and their attention to detail are unmatched. We stayed at The Club which is a beautiful oasis! A special mention for Yoni, our butler. Nothing was too much trouble and Yoni aims to always over deliver above and beyond what’s expected. On this visit to Bali where we stayed at a number of top hotels - The Legian really stood out!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
98,Beautiful resort,50,September 2022,"We recently enjoyed 10 days at the Club villas in the Legian Hotel in Seminyak.
From the first experience of the driver picking us up in one of their fleet of SUVs with cold towels and water until the return trip we enjoyed an exemplary level of welcome and service.
The club villas are truly gorgeous. The styling is contemporary Indonesian but the added koi ponds and outdoor stone bath take it up a level. In the club lounge we always received a friendly welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Their canapés every evening at happy hour (4-8!) were a delight and their bespoke cocktail blend for my husband was really appreciated.
The hotel (over the road from the Villas) is also stylish and serene. Overlooking the sea and private beach area, it provided a lovely mix of beach double beds , bar services and a change of scenery. Breakfasts in the hotel were good and again the staff very friendly and accommodating.
Finally our butler……Dedek was assigned to us….and only us…. In other resorts we have ‘shared’ a butler …..and was amazing. His smiling face and kind manner we’re always appreciated and he couldn’t do enough for us. He really made the Club Villa experience very special.
Overall an amazing hotel experience which we enjoyed and would highly recommend if you are thinking about Seminyak for your holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
99,One the best Hotels I have stayed in,50,September 2022,"The hotel staff are incredible. The level of customer service was of the highest level I’ve experienced anywhere in the world (and I‘ve travelled globally for decades).
Highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing stay in Bali, with all the nightlife options to enjoy on your door step.
Thanks to all the staff who made our holiday so enjoyable, and we’ll definitely be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
100,Family holiday,50,September 2022,First visit to The Legian post Covid. Was delighted to find it is still the grand dame it alway was. Staff were super helpful & the facilities were in good shape considering the lack of business for 2 years. Breakfast was always excellent. Will be back,The Legian Seminyak Bali
101,Absolutely magnificent!!,50,September 2022,"Could not fault the entire experience. Whatever you do make sure you get a list of the local restaurant recommendations from the concierge. Every suggestion was amazing. Truly a five star resort, with amazing staff. Make sure you tryout the daily yoga classes.

Will definitely be returning.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
102,Bali's best,50,September 2022,"Outstanding service, food, accommodation, and location. We have stayed in many hotels over the years in Bali and The Legian Seminyak stands out as the best of the best. The attentiveness to service as well as the quality of the hotel and food was spot on.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
103,PERFECTION,50,August 2022,"Everything about this hotel is perfect. From checkin the atmosphere and welcome is special. We stayed for 5 nights and this was not enough.....

The studio suite was really comfortable and with a great ocean view. The food both in the main restaurant and poolside dining was fantastic.

Breakfast is amazing with modern healthy options from a menu, as well as a complete buffet of classic options. the coffee is great! a good barometer of luxe hotels. A staff member suggested trying the artisan sourdough bread and what a great suggestion ...heavenly

The biggest compliment goes to poolside and bar staff...all of this great team deserve big thanks for making a stay at this hotel amazing. Friendly professional and just amazing in delivering what is above the standard of 5 star service.

Having stayed a few times at this delightful hotel, I was worried they may have suffered badly post covid and it may be disappointing , but there is nothing to find fault with.

There is an atmosphere amongst the team of people here that make this amazing, it really comes from the management down to everyone who works here. It is obvious that everyone enjoys working here as the caring genuine service is above and beyond expectations of 5 star hotels in a post covid world

Big congratulations to the legion team for continuing to maintain and exceed what has always been an amazing hotel, and definitely the BEST in Bali and one of the best in world terms.

I really want the amankila team to stay at the Legian to find out what a 5 star hotel should be like! as our next stay after the Legian was amankila , and what a mistake that was.

The Legian is a reason to visit Bali again ! I cannot rave enough abut how perfect this hotel is.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
104,Welcome to your new home in bali!,50,September 2022,"When your arrive at The Legian you already know you have found one of Bali’s charms but what truly makes this hotel is the staff!
From when you first enter at valet you have Agung to greet you everyday with a smile.
At breakfast - Sardita, Eddie and Swatica truly genuine.
The pool staff Dody, Budi, Hendri always happy to help and lastly Tya and Dewi the lovely concierges always going above and beyond.
This hotel truly made us feel at home and we definitely will be back! Thank you The Legian :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
105,I’d give six stars if I could!,50,September 2022,"We stayed at the Legian Club for three nights and my only complaint is that I wish we had stayed longer. The hospitality in Bali is great in general, but it exceeds expectations at the Legian. Everyone, from the front desk and restaurant staff to the guards who help you cross the street, was so lovely, warm, and welcoming. We have stayed at comparable resorts in Bali and the Legian has the most wonderful staff by far. They go out of your way to make you feel welcome and to feel at home.

We opted for the private pool villas at the Club, which are just across the street from the main hotel. You can walk there in 3 minutes or they can take you in a golf cart.

The private villas are the perfect luxury escape. There’s an outdoor pool, along with two ponds, and a large and luxurious outdoor bathtub. There was also a mini bar and plenty of space for lounging or sitting. The interior of the room is spacious and beautiful, and the shower was incredible. I don’t think the photos on the hotel’s website actually do the rooms and the villas justice. They are luxurious and beautifully designed, and the canopy style bed was a treat.

The villas also come with your own personal butler who can get you whatever you need, including making reservations. Our butler Nanda was so lovely and helpful. The club also has its own smaller kitchen where you can eat, and the staff there was so kind and eager to help.

My brother in law stayed at the main hotel and also enjoyed his stay very much. The suites there are very spacious and beautifully designed.

The grounds of the hotel are also gorgeous, from the architecture to the oceanside views. The tiered infinity pool facing the ocean is spectacular and there are plenty of lounge chairs by the pool and facing the ocean, so there was no shortage.

Another great thing about this hotel it sets it apart from most is the thoughtful touches. For instance, everything in your minibar is complimentary, which makes it easier and less stressful. There is private car service anywhere in the main Seminyak area, free of charge.

Highly recommended paying for the VIP arrival assistance option when coming from the airport. A guide will navigate you through the airport through the shortest lines and make getting through customs much easier. Also, arrange transfer through the hotel (included with certain bookings).

I can’t recommend staying at the Legian enough. It’s a blissful paradise with wonderful people that’s a respite from a busy, bustling city with lots of tourists.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
106,Special place!,50,September 2022,"The Legian is a special place, it feels more like a large home than a hotel which is meant as a compliment. Everything from the grounds, pool and restaurant is immaculate. The two bedroom suite we had was huge and comfortable. The service and friendliness is good everywhere on Bali but in the Legian they really know their craft. If your looking for a hotel where you can feel at home with a soul look no further.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
107,The Legian Seminyak,50,August 2022,"The Legian in Seminyak never fails us every time we stay here.
It’s old school Bali with just enough glamour.
As most managers of restaurants we went to in Bali everyone says The Legian is the best on the island.
Thank you Devy Angguningtyas Maharany for your kindness and help for our 2 week stay, it was the best. 🙏🏼
And all the staff that were absolutely 💯

Kind regards

108,An exceptional experience!,50,September 2022,"This is definitely a world class hotel. The outstanding feature was the wonderful staff. Nothing was too hard and we were always greeted with a smile and positive attitude. The rooms are exceptional with every needed facility, the pool areas and outside lounge facilities are magnificent. The standard of food was excellent including the breakfast choices. This is no doubt one of the best resort hotels in the world and we will be back visiting ASAP.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
109,Outstanding service in a top hotel,50,August 2022,"We spent three nights in a one bedroom ocean view suite.
Room: very well arranged with a large bedroom and a very nice bathroom. The terrace is also well equipped e.g with a kind of two person Balinese bed). One tip: we were on the second floor; ocean view from the third floor is likely to be even better…
Breakfast: simply exquisite with a very large choice of dishes and fresh fruit juices.
Spa and gym: are excellent and very clean.
Team: the service provided by the staff was top level. They always did their utmost to reply to our requests. When leaving (after check out), we were offered an hospitality suite until we left for the airport and a cake was waiting for us on the date of our wedding birthday!
The price-quality ratio is very good",The Legian Seminyak Bali
110,Superb Hotel,50,August 2022,"If your going to Seminyak, this is the hotel to stay at. Great location on a beautiful expanse of beach, yet quiet and walkable to town. Walked up and down the entire beach and it seemed clear this was the best situated property. Hotel staff were incredible and went out if their way to ensure I was having a good time. Special shout out to the pool staff who were fantastic. Stayed in a one bedroom suite overlooking the ocean and the room was spacious with two terraces. Included a free mini bar, snacks water beer etc. You can’t beat this place for hospitality. I won’t spoil the surprise but every day there was a little something waiting for you in your room. Also highly recommend the spa, all the services there were top notch.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
111,Best hotel ever,50,August 2022,"Best hotel we have ever stayed. An amazing hotel at the beach, everything you need to relax and have the best vacation experience ever. The food is great, in particular the breakfast and the fruit/juice bar. The staff is super kind and helpful with all requests. Will come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
112,Best hospitality!!!,50,August 2022,"It's an old but well maintained hotel. The highlight of my visit was the staff service. My wife just had a sore throath, the staff offered us a ginger, honey and lemon tea as soon as they know it.
Snacks and mini bar is no joke. We regreted having a dinner outside as we found out their dinner was a top notch.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
113,The Legian Seminyak is an 11 out of 10 hotel! What an amazing hotel!,50,June 2022,"Wow wow wow! What a wonderful amazing place. This is our favourite hotel in Seminyak. I can only speak highly of this hotel, from the staff, the food, the bar, the facilities ie, gym, spa, infinity pool and more.

We loved everything about this hotel. This beachfront hotel is so close to shops, bars and restaurants (Eat Street). The rooms are big, comfortable and super clean. I love the little cakes they leave in the room for afternoon tea.

A special thank you to Devy Anggun who made our stay a memorable, special time.

There are not enough words to describe how wonderful this place is.

We will certainly be back again. Terima Kasih",The Legian Seminyak Bali
114,Wonderful stay,50,August 2022,Just the most friendly and relaxing holiday we have had. The team are amazing and do a wonderful job of making you feel at home and supportive in helping you get out and about too. Really special trip.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
115,Lovely hotel in a convenient location near beach,50,August 2022,"All the hotel staff did everything possible to make us have a good time.
There were exceptional, and help us with ordering a taxi. At the pool bar you can enjoy the sunsets while sipping cocktails. Without hesitation, I recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
116,The Legian Revisited,50,July 2022,"It’s been ages since we’ve been to The Legian – our last stay was back in 2014 – and I am happy to report that the resort is still in top shape. Given that Bali is just coming out of the Covid pandemic, the fact that the hotel has maintained its very high standards is even more amazing. Although there are other luxury resorts along Seminyak beach, The Legian has the distinction of occupying the best stretch of this stunning beach (I can just gaze at the white-capped thundering waves and the surfers riding its swells for hours).

The Legian is also fortunate enough to be flanked by The Seminyak hotel on one side and The Samaya on the other, making it a quiet and peaceful respite from the noisy bars and clubs along the beach. Despite being around for almost 25 years, the hotel architecture and design is timeless, and still looks contemporary amid the flurry of new hotels and villa complexes that have sprung up inland of Seminyak beach in recent years (there is hardly any prime beachfront land left anymore).

We loved our spacious studio suite with its generous balcony on the second floor of the low-rise building, with every room facing the sea. Having stayed at other luxury hotels like Oberoi, Samaya, Alila and the W in Seminyak over the years, I can safely say that this is our favourite. The staff are lovely and work extremely hard to keep all their guests happy, often addressing you by name. We also had the pleasure of meeting the GM Hans J. Meier and Assistant GM Devy Anggun, both of whom could be seen every morning at breakfast greeting guests and making sure that the hotel runs like clockwork.

My only complaint is perhaps the breakfast offerings – we stayed for 10 nights and became a little bored after day four. All the breakfast staples on the menu were superbly cooked but there just wasn’t enough variety and creative healthy options to choose from. We understand the hotel is looking for a new Executive Chef, and we hope he (or she) will introduce a more exciting menu.

The Legian is located right in the heart of Seminyak, with many superb restaurants within walking distance (or a short taxi-ride away). But at the same time, the hotel is tucked away in its own little haven of peace. You are in literally a slice of Balinese paradise once you step into its grounds. This is our fourth stay, and we can't wait to revisit!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
117,High end hotel with amazing service,40,August 2022,"The Legian is really impressive. Amazing rooms (right up there in terms of best i have stayed in); fantastic service; breakfast was superb, great pools including a 25m pool which was great for lengths and right on the beach.
So why 4 not 5 stars? Its really just relative to the places we stayed at in Lombok where the beaches are better and the overall feel more relaxed.
If you are staying in Kuta / Seminyak and want a high end hotel I would definitely recommend the Legian",The Legian Seminyak Bali
118,THE BEST of the best,50,August 2022,"We stayed at the Club Pool Villa and this was our second time staying here. How is it possible that The Legian just keeps getting better and better? Our review relates to a stay the villa, and not all points apply to stays at the suite.

Room: Our villa was incredibly elegant, super spacious, sparkling clean, and the bed was really comfortable. We could do laps at our 10 meter pool.

Service: Now those of you who know Bali would know that the Balinese are masters of service. However, service at The Legian is in another league. EVERYONE is super friendly and smiles at you (from the restaurant staff to the security to the gardeners). They take the time to chat with you and get to know you. The housekeeping and turndown service is AMAZING! They make up your room everytime you leave. They even leave you snacks in your room every night. Special mention to our butler Pak Astika, who is the most amazing kind soul.

Facilities: Not only do they have the standard 5 star facilities, they also have a car and chauffeur take you around Seminyak area whenever you want. You also get free laundry and free minibar with alcohol. They also have free cocktail hour every 4-8pm. We love the snacks in the minibar and they kept refilling it!!

Location is excellent of course. We love that they are beachfront but we could also walk to many eateries. We also love the peaceful elegant environment of the hotel (vis-a-vis neighboring hotels which have more of a party vibe).

As you can probably tell, we LOVE The Legian and enthusiastically recommend them to everyone. At The Legian, you'll feel like a true guest, not a commercial ""customer"". We would return here every time we go to Bali if we can afford it. The Legian is maybe one of the most expensive hotels in Bali, but trust me, among all of the luxury hotels, this is the most ""worth it"". And we've tried many.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
119,The Legian Hotel Bali,50,August 2022,"Must be one of the best hotels in the world.
The building , suites, situation food , pools,gardens and its most precious commodity, the staff are exceptional.
I could not recommend The Legian more highly. The location is quiet despite the Hotel being in Seminyak",The Legian Seminyak Bali
120,We simply love the legian,50,August 2022,"My wife and I simply love this hotel. The elegance that this hotel affords is something that needs to be experienced to fully appreciate what is on offer. So much thought has gone into the service experience and the constant attention to detail from all of the team members is superb.
We keep coming back to the legian year after year and always look forward to our next visit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
121,Chris Conley,50,August 2022,"Our third return visit to this beautiful resort over the past 8 years. A touch of paradise in Bali. Lovely staff, beautiful pools and a fabulous beach front location in Seminyak.

122,"Perfect for Wellness & In the heart of the ""action""",50,August 2022,"Everything about this hotel is comforting. It's a relaxed & gorgeous place... to retreat within. The ambience was calming. The staff are exceptional. We loved our Massage - it was truly world-class. The evening meal at the restaurant was amazing! I could settle in for weeks! A few days is not nearly enough :) The highlight for us was the cold plunge pool in the Wellness area. We used the Steam, Sauna, Warm plunge & cold plunge on several days ;) Well worth it! The hotel is very well located for exploring the surrounding area.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
123,The attention to detail and service is exceptional,50,July 2022,Perfect location and the most incredible surrounds. I've seen anywhere.The staff went out of there way to make everything perfect.

124,Impeccable Service,50,August 2022,"Stayed at the Legian for the last leg of our Bali trip and we are so glad to have chosen this hotel. From our arrival to departure, the service was super friendly and attentive. The staff from check in to breakfast and poolside were all amazing and helpful. The breakfast options are extensive and were spoilt for choice everyday during our stay. The hotel location is ideally located in Seminyak and beach access is very convenient. Also want to mention the personal greeting by the resort manager on arrival and at check out, evident of a quality hotel. Thanks for a memorable stay and would stay again if we returned to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
125,Old world charm,50,August 2022,"The Legian exudes a level of service and charm rarely found in most luxury hotels. The location is idyllic on the fabulous Seminyak beach and a sanctuary from the chaotic bustle of the streets outside. The service is impeccable and personable, without ever being intrusive and the food is delightful in the ocean facing restaurant. The Spa, gym and lap pool are well equipped and uncrowded. The pool side bar is a perfect spot for an early evening drink and watch the fabulous Bali sunsets. The hotel is nearly 30 years old and in areas just starting to show it’s age, but it’s old world charm and fabulous friendly service still make it a must stay and return. Truly first rate.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
126,Remarkable honeymoon experience,50,July 2022,"The attention to detail—landscaping, room decor, every meal—was remarkable at the Legian. Elegant, well-run, and the classiest and friendliest staff you can hope for. Merta, our charming and incredibly helpful butler, in particular made our stay one we won’t soon forget.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
127,Peerless,50,June 2022,"This was my first visit to the Legian since 2018, though perhaps my twentieth stay over the last two decades. I was pleased to find virtually nothing had changed; the same excellent, well maintained facilities, the same attentive, superbly trained, friendly staff and excellent food in the restaurant, pool bar and room service. Apart from going out for dinner on a few occasions we spent virtually all our time in the hotel, exercising in the gym, doing yoga, swimming, having a massage, reading and dozing. This holiday was all about escaping Melbourne’s winter and it couldn’t have been better!
I unreservedly recommend the Legian Hotel. I will be back again next year!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
128,The Queen of Bali,50,July 2022,"We loved our stay at The Legian. Absolutely incredible. The ocean, the pools, the food all amazing. The staff can’t help you enough. They remember your name and what you order for breakfast. Staff around the pool are. so friendly. You go for a swim and when you come back, they’ve fluffed your towel and filled your water. Amazing attention to detail. The spa facilities are fabulous, hot pool, cold pool, sauna and steam room. We loved the sense of space. Our suite was beautiful and the turn down service every night is perfection. Well worth the money. We will definitely be back. Thank you.

129,Bali Bliss,50,July 2022,We had an amazing time staying at The Club in a villa with our own pool. Everything was friendly and lovely. Breakfast was very tasty and our butler Yoni was so helpful and kind. SWI and others were helpful when Yoni was busy and we would love to go back someday. The beach is across the street at the resort but it wasn’t a problem. Yoga classes on the grass facing the beach were idyllic. Very tasty Burbu Ayam for breakfast and fresh fruit made me happy;-),The Legian Seminyak Bali
130,Legian - outstanding service,50,July 2022,"Impeccable service, the staff cannot do enough for you and all done with such humility and pleasure.
Bali is a beautiful place but the Legian really made it with all the services offered.

Although Bali seems to be still for a while in the restart phase after the awful pandemic period, the Legian is at is always was: close to perfection.

The rooms are the size of an apartment

Stunning views from the third floor with stunning three level pool

Rims and air conditioner is very quiet and the sound of surf puts you to sleep

136,A must stay in Seminyak,50,July 2022,"Our family of 4 enjoyed 8 nights in Bali at this wonderful luxury hotel
We stayed in a 2 bedroom ocean front room
Which was huge!

Where do we start ?
Location
beachfront / easy walk to Seminyak shops and restaurants or take a blue bird taxi
Grounds
immaculate and traditional and peaceful
Staff
They are all so friendly and obliging and caring and personable … they make this hotel!
Facilities
Endless! Pools spa gym complimentary wellness activities beach games ….enjoy it all or just relax on a pool lounge! Dining
Amazing! The breakfast is outstanding and there’s lunch afternoon tea dinner and cocktails also to be had!

We can’t fault this hotel it was such a special holiday! There’s something for young families, those with teens and multi generation families it’s got it all !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
137,Beautiful Villas,50,July 2022,"We recently stayed at the club Villas and had a most wonderful relaxing stay. I’d have to say the rooms in the hotel need updating and refreshing and had a musty smell (stayed 1 night in a suite room) .The villas seem a lot fresher with no hint of any musty smell which can be common in Bali.
The Pool areas in the club and main hotel were beautiful.
From the moment we arrived we were ‘looked after’ in every way .Nothing was ever too much trouble and we felt extremely spoilt.
This was in a large part due to the kind and attentive staff who always greeted us with a smile .
Our ‘butler’ Gita was exceptional .Nothing was ever too much trouble to organise- whether it be dinner reservations, free transport in Seminyak or free laundry-aswell as the cleaning of our villa which was spotless!
Thank you Gita- We will be back!!
The only cons would be that the pools were not heated and they were quite cold .There was also an outdoor bath situated next to a pond and the mozzie’s loved it -Also having some goldfish back in all the ponds would be good!
But not to end on a bad note - we’ll definitely be back!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
138,Time Well Spent,50,July 2022,"Tl; Dr: If you're hesitating because of the price, don't. There is no other hotel in Bali worth your money if you intend on making memories that last a lifetime during your stay.

The design of the compound, rooms, lobby are all so traditionally Balinese, yet timeless. This hotel is not new, yet has been well maintained, very much unlike other hotels/villas in the area that are younger, yet seem more weathered.

Though if I were to nitpick, there were areas poorly maintained. Water features are mossy, and look like potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Blinds, balcony doors in the rooms were extremely stiff, and difficult to use. TVs in rooms were slightly old, and do not have the functions of a modern TV. Switches in the room were also extremely confusing in layout, with some lights that cannot be turned off, except when a master switch is used? Some also cannot be switched off but only dimmed. However, these did not impact our stay greatly and are minor gripes.

Service was impeccable, and the main benefit of staying at The Legian. For reference, not once has any staff failed to greet me while walking past, and there must've been dozens during my stay. You literally do not need to lift a finger to do anything at The Legian. There's always someone in charge of that.

Location is awesome as well. Most clubs, popular restaurants, cafes and shopping areas in Seminyak were within a 10 minute drive.

Though there are other hotels within similar price ranges that have more modern fittings, none beat The Legian at exclusivity and service. I will certainly be returning to The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
139,Beyond exceptional luxury,50,July 2022,"We have never had a more luxurious, relaxing, beautiful holiday. The staff went above and beyond in anyway imaginable. Our butler Bona, was truly exceptional in his caring attention to detail, catering to any needs, and his fun and kind attitude was infectious.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
140,"beautiful pool, room and staff",50,June 2022,"A fabulous location in Seminyak. Authentic Balinese style, top service and accomodation. The pool is sophisticated and peaceful. The yoga was fabulous. i wish I could have stayed longer to take advantage of more of the hotel facilities.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
141,Heavenly Hotel,50,July 2022,"A superb hotel in a fabulous location no wonder it’s a favourite amongst the well heeled expats of Singapore.

My husband and I were looking for a beautiful hotel to relax and recharge. The hotel and facilities are second to none and the location meant I could nip out for a little shop which was fabulous! So many fabulous restaurants and bars just a stroll away.

The staff team were wonderful, friendly, efficient and incredibly attentive. The standards are so high from house keeping front of house and the wonderful team in the restaurants and poolside. The Managers are also highly visible engaged and just can’t do enough to enhance the guest experience.

Our room was also stunning. So well appointed with stunning sea views and the sound of the roaring waves.

We have booked our next trip … it’s the only way we could bare to leave! A huge thanks to the whole of the Legian Team.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
142,Amazing Place,50,June 2022,"This was our second stay at The Legian and it did not disappoint. Apart from the stunning location and views across the water, and of course the wonderful dining options, it is the friendly service from the amazing staff that make the Legian so special. It is just the best place and we cannot wait to come back again",The Legian Seminyak Bali
143,A great experience for the memory bank,50,June 2022,"Absolutely surreal how nice this place is.
This is without a doubt, one of the best, if not the best, hotels I've stayed at ever.
The entire experience from arrival till departure was unbelievably good. We started receiving e-mails regarding our stay, prior to the stay. When we arrived we were greeted by the friendliest staff. We were then showed to our room, which was an incredible experience. We had a balcony view over the ocean. The room itself was very clean, had multiple ACs and lots of clean drinking water. Nothing were missing.
The hotel area was such beautiful asthetics, and there was often live music.
When we left the hotel, the staff was very helpful with our departure.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
144,"Excellent stay, everything was perfect",50,June 2022,"Literally nothing to complain, it was an excellent stay. We got upgraded to Two Bedroom suites and it was Flawless! Very impressed with the services, the people make sure you have everything you needed even before you arrive in the hotel. Perfect location, lots of selection for breakfast, perfect scenery! Overall very recommended to stay in this hotel",The Legian Seminyak Bali
145,Perfect A to Z!,50,June 2022,"Whenever we make our return trip to Bali, there is no question we will stay at the Legian. The staff was amazingly thoughful and acommodating. The resort was beautiful, and the suite itself was one of yhe best we have experienced. Just wonderful!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
146,Perfect in every way,50,June 2022,"We booked The Legian from online pictures/write-ups not personal recommendation, sometimes you can be left disappointed. Not the case with The Legian. Superb hotel from the accommodation, the location (easy walk into Seminyak Square) to the friendly, attentive Staff. An example of how attentive they were; we were sat on the sunbeds, my Husband had something in his eye so was using water to try and flush it, within a few moments, without being asked, “Wayan” (a staff member) had come over with boxed eyedrops! Exceptional observation skills ;-) Would highly recommend a stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
147,We’ll be back again,50,June 2022,"First in 2014 during our honeymoon

Second with 2 young kids & our parents,it was still a fantastic experience.

The level of hospitality from all the staff is impeccable

The resort manager,Alain,& partner talked to every guest everyday during breakfast or whenever they saw any of us.

We were upgraded to a bigger room and it was a great experience, especially with 2 young kids who like to run around

As this hotel has been around for some time, it will be even more fantastic if they can do some minor upgrade to their appliances, such as as latest iPhone charger other than iPod or instruction to connect our phone with TV (smart TV), more varieties for the yoga session like anti gravity yoga will be nice as well, and longer operating hours for the gym access

Overall, The Legian has blown us away again and it will continue to be our preferred hotel in Seminyak",The Legian Seminyak Bali
148,A wonderful week.!🙏👍,50,June 2022,"The Legian and all the staff are always amazing!
They remember you from previous visits!
They make you feel at home and a part of their family and always provide amazing service.
That is from the staff in the restaurant , to the front desk , right up to all managers.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
149,A really lovely stay at an amazing hotel,50,June 2022,"Certainly one of the best hotels I have stayed at and this is a consensus view held by my 2 teenage sons as well. The Legian has amazing sea views especially when taken in from either of the 3 infinity pools. I simply wasn't able to get enough of this view!
In addition, staff at the Legian were helpful and accomodating - on this note, special shout out to Arie (Concierge) for helping us with our dinner one night when we were too tired to venture out and to Dewi (Concierge) for her assistance in tracking down some plates I had my eyes on.
Location was good too. Overall, a really enjoyable stay which has left an impression - we will be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
150,Lovely hotel with staff who discriminate,10,June 2022,"Lovely hotel and grounds with staff who clearly provide preferential treatment towards certain types of customers over others. I will not disclose my encounter so as not to otherwise encourage certain types of customers or behaviours however it goes without saying no matter your physical appearance, sexual orientation, socio-economic background, religion, ethnicity or nationality, all guests should be treated equally.

Expressed my extremely disappointing encounter with a member of staff to Resort Manager Alain Eggenschwiler who said matter would be investigated but never explicitly apologised. An organisation’s ethos are laid out by top management. Makes one wonder. Shame as it’s a lovely hotel but you will undoubtedly receive more consistent service elsewhere.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
151,Simply The Best,50,May 2022,"This hotel review is full of superlatives simply because the hotel and it's team really are the very best that you can ever hope for.
From the moment we arrived (May 2022) it was clear that we were in for an amazing stay.
The architecture, decoration and environment are of the very best quality and extremely tasteful. The suite (134) was on the third floor of block one and had amazing views out to the ocean and tot he immaculately kept gardens below. A perfect place for watching the sunset if you can tear yourselves away from the beachside pool area. We had two balconies, one with table and chairs and the other with a couple of loungers.
The suite had a little kitchenette with fridge, sink, coffee makers etc. A fabulous bathroom with double wash basin, deep bath, separate shower and wc. Lighting was good around the wash basins and there is a plethora of great quality toiletries.
The bed was extremely comfy with fabulous linen and pillows.
The sitting area opening on to one of the balconies was very comfortable and a changing selection of fruit, cookies, nuts and crisps meant that you always had something to nibble on whilst relaxing.
Reception, bar, lounge areas were all spotless, exceptionally well maintained and exuding quality.
Whilst all the above matters, the stand-out attraction of this hotel is the staff who are without doubt the most caring, efficient, customer-focused team that I have ever met. NOTHING is too much trouble for them and all delivered with a smile. Quite scarily from the moment we arrived, everyone knew our names, and used them frequently- it really was quite unnerving initially, as it's so unusual in today's world for such personal service to be delivered. A big shout out to Artini who looked after us each morning at breakfast, she really is a total star, remembering just what we had to eat the previous morning and asking if we wanted the same- if the management read this review then she really deserves recognition. The management team wander around the tables at breakfast, and offer advice on topics such as tourist attractions if wanted, and again remember what your plans were for the day, to ask about it when they next meet you.
We ate breakfast and used the pool bar for lunches, both were fantastic quality food.
The pool guys bringing iced water and face clothes to keep you cool and refreshed during the day were extremely welcome and again delivered with a genuine smile.
The whole experience at The Legian was out of this world. It is no exaggeration that as were driven to the airport, we both felt emotional about leaving- never has a hotel and team of professionals brought us close to tears at the thought of leaving. WELL DONE to the whole team at The Legian, you are excellent!!!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
152,"Timeless. One of the greatest hotels anywhere. Incredible staff, amazing views, great food",50,May 2022,"If you want to stay in the best hotel in Bali, probably anywhere, then this is the place for you.

Understated elegance. No gold tassels here ! Proper design from a world famous team.

Run like clockwork by a Swiss Managing Director, but warm and welcoming at the same time.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
153,Nothing short of magical,50,May 2022,"We booked the Legian after hearing stand out reviews from other people that had been and we couldn't have been happier with the choice. We originally booked an ocean facing suite but enquired about availability at The Club upon check-in and were thrilled when a one bed pool suite was available. We got even more lucky with our butler Bona who was truly sensational. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and he often produced things you wanted before you even knew you wanted them.... almond milk cappuccinos (renamed by him almondcino - the cutest), a makeup station in the bathroom where all my products and hairdryer had been carefully laid out, afternoon tea when we were sat by the pool..... the list goes on.

We loved every second at the hotel, all the staff members we encountered were delightful and everyone seemed to be over the moon to have visitors back to the island.

The hotel is perfectly located if you want to try some of the best restaurants that Seminyak has to offer with Mauri, Bamboo, Metis, Sarong, Sangsaka just minutes away.

100% recommend and will certainly be back soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
154,Luxury in Bali,50,May 2022,"As a couple this was our third trip to Bali and The Legian was the best by far. We had a magnificent two bedroom apartment which was just amazing. It was spotless and so well appointed and the staff were always so helpful and always happy and smiling.
From the managers Al the way down everyone always made us feel welcomed and well looked after.
The view and the location is ideal
Thank you The Legian we will be back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
155,Luxus and Immense Friendliness at a Stunning location,50,May 2022,"The room I had was incredible! Very spacious with a stunning view over palms to the wide sea just in front of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful with reservations and all matters both internally and externally. They did all reservations of external activities (going to dinner, organizing drivers and sightseeings) as well as plan SPA activities and helping with housekeeping etc. The beach is just in front of the hotel, overlooked by the sunbedsm who rest in a lush lawn overlooking the beach with a lifeguard to watch the hotel guests bathing in the ocean. It was also possible to learn surfing just in front of the hotel. The cuisine of the Legian is really excellent, both for breakfast, lunch and dinner with a beatiful atmosphere, sitting in front of the ocean with its rolling waves under a clear sky or the stars! Remarkeable is also that breakfast is complementary as well as all water, which is served ice cold on the beach and the contents of a small, but nice minibar. All in all, I strongly recommend this hotel in case you can get a room.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
156,"Beautiful hotel, stunning location.",50,May 2022,Beautiful hotel in a stunning location. Food was fabulous. The hotel is immaculately clean. All staff cannot do enough for you and always smiling. The rooms are out of this world also. It’s only a short walk to the square which has so much to offer too.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
157,Our finest Bali holiday yet!,50,May 2022,"This was our 6th vacation in Bali, first at Legian. We considered this to be our best Bali holiday because…

1) The property is spectacular, and has a soul and character that defines Bali…very different from a swanky hotel that could well be located anywhere in the world!
2) The layout of the rooms, the privacy of the beach, the variety of pools and their outstanding spa makes it hard to want to get out of the property to seek a variety.
3) The restaurants, the hospitality and a genuine sense of warmth that was present in every employee that worked for the hotel.

I’ma huge fan and will definitely come back. Wish it was cheaper, but good things don’t come for cheap :-)

Anand",The Legian Seminyak Bali
158,Perfection on the beach,50,May 2022,"We had an incredible weekend at The Legian. The rooms are huge and are all facing the most gorgeous beach and ocean. Sunset was spectacular. It’s a classic and truly Balinese property filled with character. You can tell the staff love where they work. Don’t miss the spa - sauna, steam room and cold plunge were divine. We’ll be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
159,Fabulous resort and extremely well looked after during our stay.,50,April 2022,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were well looked after and treated with the greatest of respect. All the staff and management were extremely welcoming and willing to please.
All aspects of the resort were immaculate. Plenty of choice provided at breakfast and afternoon tea was complimentary.
Being on the beach stunning sunset views are experienced most nights.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
160,Amazing hotel with even better service,50,May 2022,"We stayed in The Club section of The Legian. This was such a beautiful villa with an amazing private pool. It was nice and quiet, but very easy to get to the main hotel and around Seminyak with the private drivers at the resort. The room was amazing but the service we were provided was what really set this resort apart. Astika was our Butler and went so far above and beyond to make our trip amazing. Always on top of recommendations, making sure our room was perfect, and getting us all over Seminyak. Bona was another person that went out of his way to make the room and trip perfect. Everyone we interacted with was so nice and thoughtful, we would definitely stay here again next time in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
161,SIMPLY IDYLLIC,50,April 2022,"My apologies in advance for the long review . . . this vacation was booked before the pandemic and I simply forgot what I had booked and as such the villa (you must book the villa!) was astonishing and beautiful in every respect. The villas had been refurbished two years ago and it shows - they are simply stunning. The highlight for me being the outside bathtub situated in the middle of a koi carp pond!

The hotel itself is quite delightful and the facilities for of the highest order, from the quality of the breakfasts, to the wonderful beach beds but the thing that makes the stay impeccable is the incredible staff, where nothing is too much trouble nor effort. Yoni, the butler in the villa we booked was simply fabulous and was charm personified.

I am lucky to have travelled to a lot of countries and have been fortunate to have stayed in some sensational hotels but, in my humble opinion, this is by far and away the best vacation I have ever had and was chilled from the second I walked onto the premises.

There are more dramatic hotels in the world, with much more history - Florence, Rome and Madrid spring to mind, but none of them had the staff that the Legion has - it is simply the best place I have ever stayed in.

A lot of the credit must go to Hans and his team - I really cannot praise this hotel enough!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
162,What a fantastic experience!,50,May 2022,"If you are planing to visit Bali soon, then The Legian is the hotel for you!
A grand and majestic building that takes your breath away located in the heart of Seminyak the hotel offers a busy city experience and a relaxed beach vibe at the same time.

The Club by Legian is a whole different level.
A private villa area that will make you feel like you are in a Hollywood movie set.
Villas are super chic and the private pool is to die for offering the privacy a couple may need.

The service was impeccable and I don’t think you could even ask for a higher one.
We had a private butler service and Bona was the one looking after us!
He is an absolute star and really made our stay special.

The food from the breakfast, lunch and brunch to dinner was full of flavours and colours and super delicious with well selected non alcoholic and alcoholic choices to go with.

I don’t think we will ever forget that experience to be honest as it was absolutely out of this world!

Thank you Bona and thank you The Legian&The Club @ Legian for this memorable stay!

We I’ll definitely come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
163,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,May 2022,"2nd visit to The Legian, surprise free upgrades from 2BR suite to 2BR petitenget suite. 2BR suite already have spectacular view from balcony, in Petitenget suite, size is bigger, view from balcony extraordinary spectacular. Just sitting in balcony enjoying sunset from high position is remarkable experience. The hotel staff is more excited to serve all guest after 2 years pandemic, many domestic & international tourists staying in the hotel at that moment. As i can see the hotel more lively, good ambiance & atmosphere. Food in the restaurant as excellent like usual. But still my only super minor issue is the breakfast selection should be more and the taste is already good but … this is The Legian …. The service compare to the breakfast i think they can make it more or same quality like their competitors. I believe it will be improve soon, while Bali tourism back to normal. They only need to tune up a lilbit to make it extraordinary experience to all guest who stayed in the resort/hotel. Thank you very much for your kind hospitality & also to Mr. Alain & Mr. Hans, they really working hard to fulfill what the guest demand to perfection. See u guys soon in the near future. Ciao.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
164,Simply beautiful,50,May 2022,"At last - Like many it’s been over two years since we were last able to visit one of the most beautiful hotels in Asia. My wife and I love visiting the Legian and the team make a fantastic hotel especially fantastic. Astuti, Hewdri, Dakma and Nopi along with many of the other team members are still with the Legian which is testament to the ‘family feel’ you get when staying. They are an amazing team who can’t do enough to ensure your every need is catered for. Thank you for making our stay so special and after so long. Now it’s easy to travel again we will be back very soon. Great job all of you.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Close to several of the best restaurants and stores of Bali . Strongly recommend to stay here . Wonderful !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
166,Wonderful Bali experience thanks to The Legian,50,April 2022,The staff at the Legian are truly second to none. We had the most amazing stay. Our room was incredible - a two bedroom suite that was impeccably tidied every day. The included breakfast every day was something we looked forward to. The staff bent over backwards to make our stay a truly memorable one.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
167,EXCEPTIONAL service!,50,April 2022,"The service was EXCEPTIONAL. The staff and manager were extremely courteous, accommodative of our food restrictions and went above and beyond to do so. Though there wasn’t a functional kids club yet thanks to the entire place gradually recovering from being hit with Covid restrictions, they arranged a fun and dependable nanny for the kids for when the adults wanted to head out for the day to Ubud. The lifeguard employed by the hotel went above board to entertain the kids and teach them boogie boarding as a diversion from them getting deeper into the choppy sea while playing. The rooms and suites were large, airy and absolutely beautiful! The views are stunning but the experience was made so enjoyable by the ever smiling and service oriented attitude of the staff. We would definitely go back to stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
168,Truly one of the leading hotels of the world,50,April 2022,"We stayed in the first week of April. This has been our fourth return visit and we are always amazed by the above-and-beyond service the staff provide. All returning guests are greeted with “welcome home”. They remember your name and your preferences and it feels like they give you all the space you need but are ready to help at a moment’s notice. The building has quite a few years on it, but they maintain it well and the property feels timeless. Majestic even. The views of the sunset from the bar feel quite surreal at times. Please do take time to have a cocktail at the bar and just take it all in. You won’t be disappointed. All in all I think this is one of the best hotels I’ve visited thus far.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
169,Paradise in Bali,50,April 2022,"Everytime we are in Bali, The Legian is a must. If only for the amazing pool - three levels with one level being incredibly deep for adult laps. The breakfast is also delicious and memorable. We all know that service in Bali is of another caliber, yet The Legian has some of the best, most professional service I’ve experienced. I cannot fault this hotel for anything. Years ago (2010) we came when we first got married and a few times in between. And just recently we visited with our children. Can’t wait to come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
170,Best Quiet Place in Seminyak,50,March 2022,"We stay at The Club one bedroom villa. The villa was huge and beautiful. The 2 mini bars with many complimentary treat and drinks was a really plus. The pool was big and the water was just right, not too cool. Its across the hotel but we can easily to hotel with buggy car. Our butler Mr. Astika was very helpful and kind. We visited for our wedding anniversary and Mr. Astika gave us little decor in our room. Its very romantic and pretty! The hotel has direct access to beach. The beach was very clean and have perfect sunset view. The hotel seems well maintain the beach. The hotel and villa also so quiet its seems just both of us here. Also thanks to Mr. Alain that really nice greeted us even when we checked out. He really care for his guest. Perfect place for people that looking for relaxing place.

With no hesitation I recommend The Legian to anyone that is looking for relaxed and a luxurious holiday. Staff was exceptional and the food was scrumptious.

173,"Perfect, don’t miss this luxury resort in Bali!",50,March 2022,"Memorable stay, everything was perfect!
Spotless clean from the bedroom to all the common areas and the pool.
All the team at The Legian was very attentive and helpful on my requests.

On top of all, what I have really appreciated was the attention on the details in the suite and the high quality of the amenities provided.

Least but not last, the attention to Covid safety protocol.

It’s really a luxury experience, by far the best place in Bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
174,Perfect place in Bali,50,January 2022,"Great location by the beach, close to restaurants, beach clubs and shops. The pool area is gorgeous and is the perfect spot to watch the sunset. The rooms are beautifully furnished and very good size. Service and food excellent! Looking forward to our next stay at The Legian Bali",The Legian Seminyak Bali
175,Unassuming peaceful luxury hotel in the heart of seminyak,50,December 2021,"I don’t really like staying in Seminyak because of its notorious traffic and hectic neighbourhood, but I thought since it is pandemic, it won’t be as bad. I am glad i gave it a chance since I found an oasis in the middle that is The Legian Seminyak. We stayed in The Club’s one bedroom villa and upon exiting the airport we were immediately greeted Pak Astika and escorted to the nicest smelling car. The ride to the hotel and check in was smooth and enjoyable. We love our villa and enjoy swimming during sunset in the main hotel. What separates The Legian from other 5 stars hotels is the great attention to details they put to make sure our stay is enjoyable. Phone charger was built directly behind the bed, which is a necessity nowadays. Our phone is the first and the last thing we saw nowadays lol. Water is placed besides the bed during turndown service. Plates and cutleries were provided for our gojek food. We also enjoyed the cassava root chips, canape, and afternoon tea. Thank you Pak Astika, waitresses, pool staffs and other staffs behind the scene who made our quick stopover in Bali became an unforgettable one.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
176,Perfect,50,January 2022,"Two weeks “working from home” because I wanted a break from Jakarta in the pandemic. Perfect location, excellent food, great service. Thank you for the free upgrade to a rather palatial suite. Very handy for several great cafes/restaurants, especially cafe Kim and Ku-de-ta. I had the perfect balcony - enormous with great view but also very private and not too sunny.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
177,Unarguably One of The Best,50,December 2021,"Stayed here for a week, and it was nothing short of perfection.

The property has the best position, not only in Seminyak, but i dare say all along the southeast coast of Bali - no kidding. You have the sunset perfectly facing you, and they keep the beach super pristine too. The whole compound, in fact, is just pristine: the room, the common areas, the garden, the luxurious gym (i never thought Gym can be luxurious), the spa, the beach bar areas, and the 3-tiered infinty pool. Class all the way. The design is also just beautiful. It’s, at its core, is the beautiful Balinese design that the world has come to appreciate, but has recently been forgotten and replaced with other transplanted style, that honestly is not even more aesthetically pleasing. It escapes me how designers would opt for this (looking at you W, Alila, and the just the whole bunch of you - not in the same class)

The Legian is also the closest one can get to being almost private in the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. I also love how inconspicuous the hotel is from the outside but it literally being dab smack in the middle of everything. And by this, am not exagerrating as everything that’s interesting in the procimity is literally 15 mins walk away, or 5 mins bike ride.

The service, absolutely one of the best, not only in Bali, but prolly in the world.

I really dont have anything bad to say or to add to make it better. If i do, that’d really be a stretch at this point - maybe make the food service faster. But again, it’s a stretch",The Legian Seminyak Bali
178,No.1 beachfront resort for seminyak,50,December 2021,"All hotels struggling during the pandemic, there is some minor issued, but the hotel is so lucky have the GM Mr. Alan who always keep around to check each guest 👏👏👏 salute to him. And also the team always try the best to serve. Breakfast for me is 8/10 , afternoon tea 7/10, for room well maintained 8/10 (but they need seriously renovation in the next 5 years to catch up new competitors)
Surely will be back, best pool ever 😍, suite facing to the ocean 😍",The Legian Seminyak Bali

182,Sanctuary in the heart of Seminyak,50,June 2021,"We stayed at The Club at The Legian and it definitely did not disappoint! Before going to The Legian we also stayed at Amankila, Amandari, and Capella Ubud so we have a good idea of what luxury looks like in Bali. We can safely say that The Club at The Legian is our number 1 ranked compared to the other three. When you are at The Club, you are not VIPs... you're royalty. Service is impeccable and personal (everyone knows who you are and what you are up to.. the GM even booked a restaurant for us), rooms spacious and beautiful. Honestly if you are still unsure whether to book, just book it and thank me later!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali

187,Magnificent!,50,April 2021,"They were awarded by Tripadvisor as one of the best hotels in the world and The Legian surely lives up to its title. The amazing ocean view suite and facilities were undoubtedly one of the best but we were really impressed by their astonishing services. Bu Dayu, Pak Pering, Bu Desi and all of the other staffs were extremely friendly and helpful. Thank you for making our stay unforgettable.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
188,"Impeccable and special, could not recommend more",50,July 2020,"(Traveled July 2019 but writing this review too late.) Bali is beautiful, but the Legian can be an experience unto itself. Stunning property that highlights the natural beauty of the area. Quiet and tranquil with just the lulling sounds of the beach waves. Service is impeccable and personal without ever being intrusive. The rooms and other areas somehow always look like they were just cleaned. Could not recommend more.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
189,Amazing experience with superb hospitality,50,May 2021,"We spent 10 days at this amazing hotel. All items of our stay were just top quality such as room, butler service, kindness of staff, food and spa treatments. Definitely the best hotel we have ever stayed in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
190,We will be back!,50,March 2021,"We love everything about this hotel. Suits are spacious and comfortable, hotel interior is beautifully furnished and tastefully decorated. The staff is helpful without being imposing. The quality and variety of food is exceptional. Swimming pools are excellent. Spa and massage are vey good. In general hotel’s managed and maintained to high standards!
And the beach ❤️ is one of the best in Bali. The location of the hotel is also good for shopping, and is close for making day trips, like Ubud.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
191,Don't miss an opportunity to enjoy the best Bali experience money can buy,50,February 2021,"The Legian is a landmark hotel on the Seminyak beach. Along with its neighbour, The Oberoi, The Legian experience harks back to a bygone era of unhurried luxury and Balinese charm, along with possibly the best panoramic vies of the Indian ocean from any hotel in Bali. Expect a personalized welcome right from your check in, all the way through your stay at this hotel. Chances are, the GM will greet you either at breakfast or at cocktails later (High tea and cocktail hours everyday with generous free offers were very welcome). The rooms are enormous and do take the ocean facing rooms as they all have balconies with uninterrupted views of the beach and the ocean. Nothing says bali more than having the sea breeze caress you in your own balcony as you enjoy the complimentary mini bar offers (Only Fever tree tonic water for your G&T!). All the meals are served in the restaurant facing the ocean and the bar are just a skipping stone away from the beach. Oh, the pool actually looks like they empty out onto the beach. I would encourage local travelers from jakarta to stay in this legacy hotel, some of the deals and the exclusivity during these times are un-matched. Book a holiday and stay at the Legian, you will thank me!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
192,Visit to the Legian,50,January 2021,"On behalf of the Gardners, who have used the Legian since it opened. They return to find it like a well oiled machine, the staff are always active. Nothing is too much trouble and they are genuinely helpful. There is an excellent management structure in place. They will return (as will I!)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
193,Perfect Stay,50,December 2020,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Legian and it was perfect. The room is clean, beautiful, have a direct beach access and very spacious for our 3 boys. The service was superb. Definitely will be back! Thank you!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
194,Loved it!,50,November 2020,"One of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed in. Luxurious but not pretentious. Beautiful beach and excellent swimming pools. Rooms are comfortable, equipped with everything one needs to enjoy their stay including a very good daily service. Restaurant is excellent!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
195,Simply Perfect,50,November 2020,This hotel is absolutely perfect. The attention to detail and the service quality is outstanding. No request is too much for the staff. The staff always greet you my name and remember your personal preferences (eg. My breakfast preferences were always remembered and prepared accordingly). Thank you Legian team for providing me with a home away from home. I look forward to come back very soon! A big thank you to the GM also for a lovely personal Swiss touch!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
196,AWESOME / INCREDIBLE / THE BEST,50,October 2020,The Legian is with NO DOUBT - THE BEST HOTEL in Seminyak and one of the top 10 hotels in Bali. We loved our stay and we can’t say enough good things. The staff are all super professional and attentive - the rooms are large and well decorated and the pool is perfection - from the design - the positioning in front of the beach and once again THE SERVICE Pool side was a PERFECT 10. The General Manager - Alain attention to detail is very apparent - he moves around the hotel attending to everything - including checking on the guests. He certainly sets the standard level for the hotel. The COVID-19 Protocol was spotless. I can not recommend this hotel enough!!!!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
197,Highly Recommended,50,September 2020,"Having been to Bali so many times and stayed in several different five stars hotel on every visit mainly for leisure, The Legian Bali stands out: wonderful beach and sunset view, friendly staffs, very attentive and friendly resort manager (Mr. Alain Eggenschwiler), excellent food, great location, spacious and comfortable room. Over all this is one of the best hotel we had ever stayed in Bali.. Taking beautiful sunset pictures, peaceful sensation from the sound of the ocean during the night were just only a few of our many memorable experiences during our stay in The Legian Bali.
I highly recommend The Legian Bali for people looking for excellent hotel in Bali.. We are looking forward to be back..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
198,The Best Hotel in Bali ❤️,50,October 2020,"This hotel is - from my point of view - by far the best hotel in Bali and certainly one of the best hotels in Asia. Living in Switzerland and having travelled many countries in Asia for both business and leisure, the Legian in seminyak stands out : friendliest staff, excellent location, excellent food and top notch rooms and spa facilities and a wonderful beach view (if you stay at the front house) are only some of many positive points of this hotel. In all aspects, the hotel is highest quality by international 5 star standards. I highly recommend a stay in this paradise hotel !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
199,Wonderful Stay at a REAL Balinese Resort,50,September 2020,"The Legian Seminyak has never disappointed. After so many years, I finally had the chance to stay here again. Service was impeccable, the staff always made sure that my friends and I had everything we needed. The food was delicious and I absolutely loved their gym. However, my beautiful room is what made my stay special. With high quality, elegant, Balinese interior design, I truly felt like royalty. I think preserving the island’s aesthetic is very important and a lot of resorts have forgotten that. I recommend The Legian Seminyak for those of you who want to experience the best of what Bali has to offer.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
200,Perfect Getaway,50,September 2020,"My husband and I have been to Bali many times and this was by far our favorite resort stay. We chose a suite for the ocean view and loved sleeping to the sounds of the waves every night. The room was immaculate, the staff was thoughtful and helpful, and the ladies at the spa were simply the best. The restaurant was so good that we never even ventured out to the other great places in Seminyak and the wine selection was impressive. Even during COVID times and low occupancy, none of the quality has been sacrificed at the Legian. We would love to return one day.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
201,Beautiful and Memorable Experience,50,September 2020,"A very nice hotel with an excellent sunset view. The room’s design is beautiful, wonderful service, great food, relaxing atmosphere, and the best part is we were able to lay down and swim while enjoying the sunset, and take photos at the beach that can be accessed straight from the hotel. A truly memorable experience for us.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
202,what a welcome and memorable stay,50,September 2020,I was looking for a place to celebrate my birthday with a small group of friends and I decided to go back to my all time favorite hotel The Legian and booked the Beach Villa which is basically the only beach front villa in Seminyak. Executive Chef Stephane prepared four course dinner and F & B Director Pak Edi prepared amazing table setup overlooking to ocean and of course legendary service of The Legian; we had a memorable night. The Legian certainly the establishment that sets the standard in Bali!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
203,One of The Best in Bali,50,August 2020,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in, from staff service, cleanliness of rooms and hotel areas, hotel location, cleanliness and quality of food, we really enjoyed staying while at this hotel and will come back on another occasion, highly recommended ... 👍",The Legian Seminyak Bali
204,Bali's Best,50,August 2020,"Quality Quality Quality!!! The hotel, the staff, the food, the pools, the beach, the amazing rooms, everything about this hotel is Quality! What an incredible hotel. Attention to detail and such friendly staff. Well done The Legian 10 out of 10",The Legian Seminyak Bali
205,The Best in Bali,50,July 2020,"Service was very special and I felt that I was the only one at the hotel!
(The hotel had just reopened and not many people were there yet)
This is important as this place is usually booked and difficult to get a room.
Even with the hotel just reopening, the staff was courteous and kind, helpful and fully professional.
The food was delicious, thanks to the special attention of Michelin Star chef Stephane Gortina.
The rooms are spacious and every one has a great view of the most beautiful beach I have ever been in Bali!
Great job to the staff and general manager Alain Eggenschwiler for one of the best experiences I have ever had on this beautiful island of Bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
206,Quarantine in Paradise,50,March 2020,"We have stayed over a month during March/April '20 in the wonderful Legian Hotel with its intimate atmosphere. The warm experienced staff have made our stay a very memorable one. Again we experienced a warm bath with the entire Legian Family. Even though Bali was in lockdown, we had a very beautiful stay because of the dedicated staff. Perfection with top service and a smile. The location of the property is breathtaking! We will definitely return with our family.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
207,Perfection!,50,March 2020,"My husband and I spent a blissful three days/nights at The Legian in early March. It's hard to describe how focused on service everyone we encountered was. They simply could not do enough for us and everyone was so warm, welcoming and friendly. The staff we encountered made our stay here so special from the minute we walked in the door until we reluctantly left.

The property itself is beautiful and right on the beach with a series of infinity pools that look as if they flow right into the ocean. The lawns are perfectly manicured and the vibe is tranquil. The open air restaurant is the perfect place to have breakfast or dinner while looking at the beautiful ocean view and enjoying the sea breeze. Our suite room was large, comfortable, well appointed, spotlessly clean and delightful with two outside seating areas and a view of the ocean.

Afternoon tea is served in the cabana type bar by the ocean each day and it's delightful. We also had a casual dinner in the bar one evening and it was very good. The included breakfast was amazing with both buffet items as well as made to order. We had two dinners in the restaurant as well and they were delicious. I particularly recommend the slipper lobster curry. The staff in the dining area were constantly checking in to assure that we had everything we needed. In the evening there is live music from a baby grand piano and that adds the perfect touch to the beautiful, tropical, romantic atmosphere.

We spent most of one day at the pool and the attendant there couldn't do enough for us bringing ice water, cool cloths, replenishing drinks, snacks, dry towels, adjusting our umbrella etc. A set of stairs leads from the pool area to the beach for a nice stroll. The spa area is also beautiful and nicely appointed. I had a traditional Balinese 90 minute massage that was awesome!

The Legian is located near the bustling area of Seminyak as well as the flea market for shopping, however you would never know it as the property itself is an oasis of peace and calm. Although we ventured out we were quick to return to our paradise.

With this being our third trip to Bali, we had considered returning to a previous hotel in Jimbaran Bay that we had liked a great deal. We decided instead to try The Legian because of it's smaller size, more intimate atmosphere and location right on the beach. We were so happy with our choice - it exceeded our expectations in every way and if we are fortunate enough to return to Bali someday we will definitly stay here again. It was Perfection!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
208,"Luxury, top service and zen feeling all day!",50,February 2020,"It was our first trip to Bali as a family with our son of 1y and 8 months. We arrived at the hotel after a 23 hour trip, right during the most beautiful sunset. We were welcomed with open arms and we couldn’t resist going straight to the pool area to enjoy the beautiful sunset. From that moment all stress was gone.
What an amazing relaxing place this was and all the staff were really friendly and especially sweet for our little boy.
From the manager to security, they always kept an eye on him so he wouldn’t go too close to the stairs or pool.

The hotel feels really intimate, so is the service, almost all staff knows you by name and are always friendly and smiley and help you with whatever you need.
Since our son is a light sleeper, they were extremely accommodating to help create the best environment for him to sleep in.

During the day, it’s really relaxing by the poolside, you can choose single or double beds or a cabana and again everybody goes out of their way to make you comfortable.

All the food provided at the hotel is really good, from breakfast to dinner to lunch at the pool, you notice that the quality and care is there. There is a kids menu but this was not really suitable for our son yet, but it was no problem at all to make something else. The only thing was that it wasn’t easy to order vegetables that were cooked well enough so a lot of times, the food had to go back which isn’t ideal with a hungry baby but the staff really did their best and always with a smile.

When we travel as a couple we usually always have dinner outside the hotel so the only thing we were worried about was that the hotel only had one restaurant...but were we wrong. The setting and food is amazing and every evening the chef provides a different tasting menu which is really high end.
We did have a babysitter and tried a few restaurants outside the hotel but we were always happy to be able to return to “our restaurant” the next evening. It was every time such a romantic and relaxing evening with great service and food. What else do you need?

We have experienced quite a few luxury hotels and I must say this was by far one of our best experiences ever.
The staff really knows what they are doing and for me it’s always in the details. Like there is “the candle guy” who lights all the candles around the hotel every evening, creating such a nice vibe, different from the daytime.
No matter the number of guests dining at the restaurant, there was always live piano music. In the morning you are welcomed by traditional live music. There are fish in all the ponds and the staff always has fish food nearby which is the best attraction for small children.
And the massage beds at the spa are extremely comfortable...

We liked this hotel so much, we decided to go back there when my fiancée was told he couldn’t fly because of an earinfection and to be honest, I felt bad for him but I was really happy to be able to spend more time at our home away from home.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
209,PERFECT,50,March 2020,"This has been a bucketlist property for some time. We finally got to experience The Legian and it lived up to all expectations.

The property has been around for quite a few years but they have definitely kept it in great condition. This works in its favour as the staff are tenured (which reflects in the impeccable service) and everything feels as it should be.

The Legian is in a great location. It is right on the beach, tucked away in a quiet location in Seminyak but close enough to get to on foot.

I have had the fortune of staying in many properties in Bali and The Legian is a gem. I would not hesitate to return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
210,Truly Exceptional,50,February 2020,"This is a true 5 star experience. Dewi on the front desk is amazing, everyone is amazing. I cannot explain in words what makes this place so special but I will try. It is simply that everyone working here wants you to enjoy your stay, wants to help without throwing forced smiles or without it feeling robotic.
The common areas are just classy and sparkling clean, the Deluxe suite we had was out of this World (see pictures), so many little touches from the incense to the cookies to the bottled water by your bed at night. It is one of those places were everything is just perfect.
During the day the swimming pool area is so relaxing, you get treated like royalty and the Afternoon Tea served to your sun lounger is truly special. Iced water, cool face towels, Iced Latte, cakes (and all included in your room price!!)
If you are staying in Seminyak I would strongly advise you stay at The Legian if your budget allows it. I stay at probably 20+ hotels every year and many of them ""5 star"" and this is certainly in the Top 3 for me.
I am certainly looking at rebooking but this time for 2 weeks next year, I can see why so many people are return customers.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
211,Incredible!!,50,February 2020,"This place...from the moment I walked onto the property, the service and sincerity of the management, staff, and everyone I encountered was just incredible. I reserved one of the (what I thought to be) smaller suites as I was travelling solo, and I could not believe the size of it, it was much larger than the pictures depicted on the website.

I truly hope to be back here again, this was top notch service and facilities - highly recommend!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
212,A flawless hospitality,50,February 2020,"You can really tell how great your stay will be from the very first moment you are greeted when you arrived. That’s what we felt when we are greeted sincerely and the reception assist us upon arrival. Check in was smooth, luggage handling done in precise time and what’s even best is everywhere we went within the hotel, each department address us by name even when we approached the host at The Restaurant already knew it was us who will dine that particular evening.
Needless to say regarding the Daily Dinner Specials that we experienced, exquisite menu with the company of ocean wave choirs and piano, splendid.
Truly an unforgettable sweet escape!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
213,"World class Hotel, top 3 of best luxury Hotels I have ever stayed ad.",50,February 2020,"Everything is above and beyond on The Legian, the service from a more than friendly staff you will not find better anywhere in the world. The food is freshly made and top quality and the executive chef is rated 1 Michelin star, all in all A MUST STAY in Seminyak!
I can not wait to be back in heavenly hotel.

Thank you for everything",The Legian Seminyak Bali
214,Exceptional Stay!,50,February 2020,"I have been staying periodically at the Legian for the last 23 years. The Legian goes beyond its luxury status and is set apart from any of the hotels I have visited in the world.

Immaculate attention to detail and personal touches makes you feel special. If you would like an wonderful experience that resonates with being in Bali and not part of a hotel chain where you could be anywhere in the world.

The Legian design is an aesthetic that is uniquely Bali!

My home away from home!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
215,Superb hotel with fantastic service - highly recommended,50,February 2020,"The welcome and service we experienced was impeccable - from the hotel manager, to the waiters, to the staff who cleaned our rooms - everyone went out of their way to make us feel special. The rooms are lovely and are much nicer than they look on the website. The Restaurant is exceptional! Fine dining at its best. Would also highly recommend the spa treatments. The hotel is also in a great location. It's in a vibrant area with lots of lovely shops and restaurants which are easily accessible by foot.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
216,Fantastic hotel even though some minor issues,50,February 2020,"The staff, service, and overall amenities at this hotel are 5 star all the way. From the moment I arrived the staff recalled my name and went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and pleasant. I was really able to relax for a short weekend. The food was top notch as well. I will definitely stay again.

However, there are a few areas for improvement which I hope management takes note of. I had to call maintenance 3 separate times to fix the desk power outlets, the in-room sound system, and bathroom mirror. Additionally, the wifi was problematic constantly disconnecting and reconnecting. Although these on their own are minor inconveniences, it is surprising to have so many. Finally, I think it's quite strange how poorly insulated the doors are. Hot, humid air pours into the room from the westerly winds which makes the AC work hard. Worse, there would often be condensation inside the room as a result of the outside air condensing inside the cold room. After a thunderstorm I woke up to see the nightstand and my phone wet with condensation. On my last day, the rain was so strong I had to put towels down at the base of the doors to prevent water from coming into the room. For such a luxury resort this is really not 5 star.

Overall, though, my stay was still superb and I hope my feedback can be used to fix these problems before they become bigger issues.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
217,World Class,50,February 2020,"Quite simply one of the finest hotels in the world. Outstanding service, beautiful grounds and a perfect location, every detail was flawless. The rooms are stunning and the staff is as good as it gets. Highly recommended you will not be disappointed.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
218,Excellence at The Legian Bali,50,February 2020,"We have just returned from an exceptional week of RnR at The Legian Bali. The property provides a restful environment, with excellent cuisine and faultless, friendly service. Offsite restaurants and shopping are close to hand. I can't imagine it getting better than this!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
219,Doesn't get any better!,50,January 2020,"The room is exquisite. The view is beyond all expectations. The food is glorious. But what really sets this apart from any other place in the world (and we've been to many parts of the world) is the service and the people. The service is flawless, total follow-up on the smallest of inquiries. The staff is warm, kind, friendly, sincere and top notch. We didn't want to leave.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
220,"perfect all for a child, mom, dad, and 85 year-old granny",50,January 2020,"clean, very kind. They understand what we need and want at the perfect moment. It was our 3rd time went back to Legian and we will be back to next year again. We do not look for any other hotel if we decide to go to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
221,Excellent property in Seminyak Bali,50,January 2020,"My partner and I stayed at the Legian for a total of 3 days and 2 nights. It was a wonderful property to stay in. The facilities were excellent, doorstep access to the beach and the staff were friendly and helpful. They remembered us by our last names. Breakfast spread was good and had a nice selection.

The only hiccup was during check out, there was a minor incident involving the spare room key. But overall, objectively, it was a pleasant stay there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
222,Consistently brilliant.,50,January 2020,"My wife and I have just finished a 5 night stay at The Legian. This was our third visit to the hotel, and it was, once again, without fault. This is the type of establishment that is becoming increasingly hard to find in a world of generic international 5 star hotel chains. The kind of personalized, above-and-beyond customer service that is exemplified by The Legian doesn't merely conform to the highest industry standards, it redefines them. It is abundantly clear that staff--all staff--regard the guest not as a distraction from their real work, but the reason for it. We experienced a couple of issues during our stay, all of which, I must emphasize, originated from our side. But senior management resolved them quickly with the utmost professionalism and a laser focus on guest satisfaction. Nothing is too much trouble, no detail is neglected. One is always left with the feeling that the staff genuinely care about the well-being of their guests. This is rare indeed. Well done to Alain, the GM, his executive management team, and all the staff with whom we interacted. It was a pleasure. You are a credit to your profession, and genuinely fine human beings.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
223,Family Vacation,50,January 2020,Great location. Plenty of shopping and fine dining restaurants within walking distance. Fantastic beach connecting to hotel pools. Service is top notch with very friendly staff. Would love to return again. Great experience overall.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
224,How do you improve on perfection?,50,January 2020,"I cannot say enough about how incredible our stay was at the Legian. The service was the best I have ever seen, the hotel facilities, setting and our room were all exquisite. The sunsets were magical, the breakfast a diverse, healthy and scrumptious feast, and I had one of the best massages ever.

The attention to detail is constant. The staff are very well trained, friendly and remembered our names. The cocktails are original and fresh, great location, and good security making us feel “tucked in”, as the beaches can get rowdy in some parts of Seminyak and Kuta (but not here). I hope to make it back someday as I can’t imagine staying anywhere else!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
225,The very best hotel,50,January 2020,"We have just spent a week at this remarkable hotel. The location right on the beach at Seminyak is just perfect
The hotel is elegant and timeless and incorporates a gentle Balinese style
The service is second to none with every detail considered and nothing too much trouble (including sending aloe vera to the room for sunburn and a delicious chocolate cake for my husbands birthday)
The staff, from management down are warm, friendly, and efficient.
We were made to feel at home from the moment we arrived and were addressed by name by everyone the entire time.
Oh and the food was delicious and beautifully presented.
We cannot speak highly enough of The Legian and would not consider staying anywhere else when in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
226,Only have praises for the Legian Bali,50,January 2020,"The experience at the Legian Bali is beyond words. However, I will still try my best to capture my stay there. Service is excellent. The staff go the extra mile to ensure that every guest is comfortable and attended to. Every morning during breakfast, the hotel's staff would engage in small talks with guests, and they take a genuine interest in hearing about our stories. The impeccable service is unparallel and it would really be the thing you'll miss most after staying at the Legian Bali. I will rave about the Hotel's pool and beach as well because this is probably what most of us visit Bali for. There is probably no other inifinity pool like the one at the Legian Bali! Their pool has three-tier and it literally leads you to the beach. I have no idea how to explain its grandeur further. Please just google it!

Finally, while I'm glossing over the Hotel's food, rooms and facilities, they are definitely a notch above most five star hotels in Bali! All I can say is that if you are searching for the perfect hotel for your vacation in Bali, look no further. Book a couple of nights here and you'll see why I am so beguiled with the Legian Bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
227,Unforgettable!,50,January 2020,"The Legian delivers service like no where else we have ever stayed!
The staff are some of the most professional and attentive hotel employees.
From knowing your name, to remembering your coffee order and sending aloe Vera and coconut water to our room when we were sunburnt.
The Legian delivers a luxurious and very relaxing holiday in a calm and serene environment.
Looking forward to returning soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
228,Fantastic!,50,January 2020,"This hotel is simply amazing. The rooms are like upmarket apartments, with an entrance hall, kitchen area, guest bathroom, dining room, lounge, huge bedroom and massive bathroom. The veranda is comfortable with table and chairs and a bed like couch. Perfectly clean and very classy. All this overlooking the ocean, with beautiful sunset and fresh sea air and waves breaking.
The 3 pools next to the beach are pristine and large enough for an Olympic swimmer to do laps in. The breakfasts lunch and dinners were superb, not to mention high tea everyday at 4.
The whole ambience of the place is relaxed and you don't get that feeling of commercialism. Then of course the staff. Super friendly and always visible and professional. This includes management. We used the Spa almost daily and it comes highly recommended by my wife and I. The gym is also amazing.
There are always lifeguards on duty and what seemed to be child minders.
The hotel is an interesting 30 minutes drive from the airport and is in close proximity of many upmarket restaurants and shops.
We will go again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
229,GREAT Hotel and Fantastic beach location in Seminyak!,50,October 2019,"This hotel is a 5 Star experience in Bali. The Legian staff is incredible, they're at your service on a moments notice, literally everyone in the hotel will know your name by the end of the first day stay. They have a gourmet restaurant that has a wonderful dinner and simply amazing breakfast buffet overlooking the hotels beautiful pools and perfect location on Seminyak Beach. The spa is very good, gym is average but clean. My favorite is the room suites we stayed in and the two tiki styled bars for guests only that my wife and I enjoyed numerous sunsets. The hotel is Swiss managed so it truly runs like a beautiful swiss watch. Only complaint is the wine list is poor, but then again I'm blessed with the world class vinyards in my California backyard. Book and enjoy!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
230,The Legend of the Legian,50,January 2020,We stayed twice at this property in one trip. If you are looking for great service and a beautiful luxury resort in Bali this is where to go. We spent the first 4 days of our trip here. The room was gorgeous along with the property and the service. We than went to Ubud to the Ritz but ended coming back the same night as the Ritz has a major problem and we decided to come back to what was a little piece of paradise. The Legian is a beach vibe but with the sophistication and 5 stars. Don’t get me wrong the Ritz in Ubud was lovely but the service was awful and there had been a few issues within the first 2 hours of our arrival. If I were to go back to Bali I would only go to the Legian. All the rooms face the ocean and have good views. Breakfast was also fantastic and the hotel does not feel crowded or over run even when full.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
231,Ms Rebecca Hetrel and Mr Artion Zotaj,50,January 2020,"Just cannot recommend The Legian Bali strongly enough. From the moment we arrived to the minute we departed we felt like part of a beautiful family and the staff are what make this hotel particularly special. Stefan’s menus are sublime! Kadek Sardita on room service is such a joy! The entire concierge and front desk staff could not have been more helpful with any request including a surprise Christmas tree with all of the trimmings fur a surprise for my fiancé and on and on, they even managed to PERFECT a fredo espresso in no time at all!! The rooms and facilities are beyond divine and we miss it already and just cannot wait to return to see everyone and we hope “the judge” is at the front to greet us when we return, we miss you all

232,A really amazing hotel,50,December 2019,"We loved our stay at this beautiful hotel in no small part because of the service and staff. The extra touches and personal feel of the hotel with the management chatting to guests added to the welcoming atmosphere. The food was delicious. We stayed over new year and although Seminyak was incredibly busy, once we entered the hotel, a sense of peace and calmness prevailed.Hopefully we will return and many thanks to all.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

235,Great ambience - Pure elegance,50,November 2019,"My stay was low season - What a fantastic feeling this hotel gives you, something magical. The yoga option is a great way to start the day, just before breakfast. The manager was great and made sure everything was ok. Can't wait to go back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
236,Simply the best hotel in the world,50,December 2019,"The Legian can easily be classified as 7 star hotel. Its 5 star and beyond. The two extra stars that shine above every other hotels are from the dedication of service and perfection.

Staffs make effort to remember all our family member's name, addresses us by our individual names during our dinner order, even our kids.

What sets the Legian apart from the competitions are not just the flawless location, the almost private beach, perfect building and interiors, the jawdropping view of sunset from every suites, the amazing food by extraordinary chef, and the way they pampers you with the welcome canapes and daily snacks. Its the combination of all of that plus a major dose of smile from every staff member.

I think all the other five star hotels in world need to learn the true meaning of hospitality from The Legian Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
237,Perfect days at the Legian Bali,50,December 2019,"We spent 5 nights at the Legian Bali. The entire stay was simply fantastic! The room (ocean view), the staff, the breakfast, the spa, the beach and the yoga classes... Everything was just wonderful. We travel a lot, but likely never had such an all-over satisfying experience. We particularly enjoyed the calm of the entire resort, the attention and kindness of all staff. We want to go back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
238,Wonderful hotel,50,December 2019,"The Legian Bali is one of those once in a lifetime hotel. Tye rooms are large, elegant, and also very spacious. Everyone from the moment you arrive knows your name and the concierge helps choose best restaurants. The place is an Oasis from the busy Seminyak. There are so many hotels in Bali. What makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the service. This is a very special place. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
239,The Legian Bali Hotel 💗,50,March 2019,"The Legian Bali Hotel is situated right on the beach front at Seminyak & is only a short stroll to the main center of Seminyak. I have had the pleasure of staying at this luxury hotel s number of times. The Legian hotel is a true 5 Star Hotel with 6 Star Service!!!. Once again thank-you to Hanns, the staff for always making each stay a fantastic and relaxing stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
240,What a wonderful experience,50,November 2019,"Legian's was the last of a multi-leg trip and a rest on the beach before returning to the UK.

The hotel was fabulous, staff so attentive without being over the top.

The location was incredible and the sunsets are what dreams are made of!

Sitting watching the sunset, with a G&T in hand, makes it hard to leave but easy to return!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
241,amazing holiday,50,December 2019,"Hospitality, amenities, faculty, location....everything is perfect.
I definitely come back this resort again and strongly recommend to other.

If I could give you small advise, keeping dry linen in the bed room would be grate.
All rooms are facing ocean, it makes linen humid. so this might be bit challenge for you.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
242,Simply The Best !,50,November 2019,"A classic luxury hotel in Seminyak area. Everything's here and all well very well maintained. The food is superb here at the restaurant, you need to try their squid ink risotto. Not to mention the sunset here is breathtaking 😍. Can't wait to go back for more!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali

The Legian Bali appeals to all the senses; the breeze from the ocean, the gentle and intoxicating aromas, visually harmonious pathways and vistas, soft music played by Balinese musicians. Fresh & delicious foods...

Yes we are already planning our return..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
244,Best hotel I’ve ever stayed in,50,November 2019,"I cannot think of anything the Legian could do better. The property, the views and above all the exceptional service is beyond anything I’ve seen in 40 years of travelling the world. This is simply the best.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
245,Best part of our 17 day Honeymoon!!!,50,November 2019,"My Husband and I spent 4 AMAZING nights at this resort. We went to Singapore, Maldives, and Thailand after staying here, and The Legian in Bali was our favorite place!! The service everywhere else can't even come close to the service that the Legian provided us. All the staff is so nice and friendly and everything is walking distance.. They catered to all of our needs. The best we have ever had. The breakfast buffet is top notch and so was our beautiful room. The pools and spa were gorgeous. The beach was pristine and the day beds were amazing. Turn down service really set the mood every night. They set us up with our own personal driver (very inexpensive) and he was awesome!!! I highly recommend requesting him if you want to go on adventures. He knows a lot about the culture. His name is IKETUT SUDIKA. telephone/whatsapp: +62 81 338 480 899 or Facebook: Ketut Dollar. It was the best resort we have ever been to! Thank you for making our honeymoon so special..We will be seeing you again in the future!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
246,Best Hotel By Far,50,November 2019,"My husband and I have recently returned from this amazing hotel. We have travelled to many countries and stayed at many luxury hotels but The Legian stands out well above the rest!

The staff are extremely attentive and make you feel at home. From the bell boy, to reception staff, to pool staff to the general manager, each guest is always addressed by their name. Breakfast staff remember what you ordered the previous morning and have it ready for you every day. It’s these small personal touches that make you feel like you’re the only guest in the hotel.

The rooms are outstanding. The service is second to none. The sunsets are breathtaking

I can not recommend The Legian enough. We will be back...very soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
247,Excellence in Hospitality,50,November 2019,"The staff and the facilities of the hotel make you feel like in a luxury retreat, where any wish is taken care of. And that is their promise! Upon arrival, me and my fiancée received an upgrade to a bigger suite and besides the remarkable size, cleanliness, comfort and high-qualitative interior design, the staff made sure that even the smallest wishes were granted, e.g. my fiancée had her birthday on the arrival date and the entire suite was covered in rose bouquets, rose petals and they prepared some delicious little Sacher cakes to wish her a lovely birthday! The suite was cleaned 2 times a day, but honestly it felt like every time we stepped out of it, someone from housekeeping was going inside and making sure everything is tidied and clean. So again, superb service! Breakfast was also stunning in the open restaurant with a beautiful view on the beach. Unluckily the beach in Seminyak is a bit too rough to swim, but that really didn't matter at all. The only thing I'd recommend to other guests is that when choosing a third party driver and not their inhouse driver make sure to get one yourself, otherwise you pay more than twice as necessary. Ultimately, this high quality has its price and for us, it is justified mostly in the case of The Legian. We come again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
248,Unparalleled service.,50,October 2019,"Exceptional all-around. Flawless hotel and service, with incredible location and amazing breakfast. Back in frigid Chicago, and already planning the return trip to The Legian Bali for 2020. There are a lot of high-end hotels in Bali, but this is a true gem.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
249,Best Service we have ever encountered!,50,November 2019,"We were met with excellent service from the moment we departed Denpasar airport. We were whisked away to our resort and were welcomed as if we were regulars.
Constantly the staff were attentive, responsive, and addressed us by our names during our stay.
We attempted to stay fit, so the gym was adequate to our needs, including the daily morning yoga sessions.
The spa was also amazing to our needs which included a skin treatment, and massages.
Daily breakfast was buffet style with eggs off the menu to our liking.
Location wise, close to Motel Mexicola, and walking distance to main shops in Seminyak
Alain and his team are definitely to be commended on such an amazing experience, and we look forward to the next installment of Legian in Lombok.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
250,Most exceptional hotel in Bali,50,November 2019,"I would like to say with strong confidence that the Legian is the best hotel in Bali. I know some that can provide good services, comfortability, beautiful views, and wonderful experiences etc. If you ask me about what makes the Legian exceptional compared to others, I would say they put more emphasis on offering honor to customers. Specifically they always pay careful attention to keep a comfortable distance with each customer. Actually I had never feel uncomfortable during our stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
251,Outstanding Experience at The Legian,50,October 2019,"For the beach phase of our trip to Bali, we stayed at The Legian, primarily based on the reviews of other TripAdvisor contributors. We very much enjoyed our 4-night stay there. The level of personal service and rooms were top-notch, and we especially were so impressed with the friendly and helpful staff, many of whom recognized and addressed us by name when greeting us. Very impressive. We especially want to recognize and thank the resort manager, Mr. Alain Eggenschwiler, who graciously offered us the complimentary use of a room after our checkout time since our departing flight wasn't until very early in the AM the next day. His kindness and emphasis on customer service helped us out and cemented our impression of The Legian as worthy of its five-star rating. We had an elegant dinner our final night at the resort with an unobstructed vista of the beach before us. The food was delicious, and reasonably priced for the high level of cuisine. Should we return to Seminayak again, we know where we will be staying. Highly recommend this property.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
252,Best Hotel we've ever experienced!,50,October 2019,"Words cannot do this place justice (certainly the website doesn't begin to do it justice)!
From the moment you step in the door and look through the open plan reception to the ocean waves crashing in the distance you'll be in a dreamland.
This is a luxury hotel that lives up to expectations in every way.
We are lucky to have experienced several fantastic hotels all around the world but this is by far and away the best one.
The facilites, as you would expect, are first class. Spotlessly clean, well-maintained, spacious and comfortable. All rooms have a sea view and you can enjoy the spectacular sunsets from your own balcony if you wish.
We had a superior double and it was very spacious. It was also well-appointed including a Bose sound system with its own ipod, a very large en-suite bathroom with his/hers sinks, a bath and shower. The balcony had a large double lounger on it.
The bed is a poster bed and the mattress is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on.
We could have happily spent all day in the room....if it wasn't for the fact that the rest of the hotel was so lovely.
The breakfast room/restaurant is semi open-plan and a very nice place to enjoy your meal, looking out over the pool and beyond to the sea.
Breakfast itself was a treat, with everything you would expect of such a hotel, all served fresh and any special requests were dealt with without any fuss. The kitchen is open plan and central, so you can see your food being prepared.
We ate in the restaurant two nights and that too was wxcellent. The head chef is french. We ordered the special which was a veal for two. The chef came and carved it at the table and it tasted amazing.
There are lots of different places to relax around the hotel. We were there during the UK half-term school holidays but it never felt busy. We never struggled to get a lounger where we wanted.
The loungers are well-kept by attentive staff. If you leave it to jump in the pool, when you return the towels well be all re-set like new. Iced water is provided and topped up regularly. Cold towels and a flower are also a nice touch. At 2 and 3 o'clock a little treat of icecream or speciality tea is brought around, and at 4 o'clock a complimentary afternoon tea selection of cakes and sandwiches is served. Lovely!
There are actually 3 large infinity pools which are all linked. The pool temperature was very comfortable.
On a night there are flame lights around the grounds and the pool - it looks quite spectacular.
Lifeguards are on duty all day watching hotel users as they go in the sea. There are also security guards on duty all day - but they are unobtrusive.
I could go on and on about the facilities, but the best thing about this hotel is the staff.
The staff will attend to your every need. But unlike some places where they are hovering over you, they are almost invisible. Almost, except for the lovely smile they all seem to have. They genuinely seemed happy in their job, and their job was to make your holiday as comfortable as it could be. In the week we stayed we never found a staff member whose attitude and service was less than 100%.
We ventured out of the hotel quite a lot on foot.
Usually on a lunch time to sample one of the nearby bars/restaurants on the beach. And on an evening we walked into the town. The hotel is very well located and there is a lot to explore nearby. Town is much more 'lively' than the tranquility of the hotel, but in a good way - it always felt safe.
As you might expect, the prices in the hotel are a little higher than some of the more rustic optons nearby, but not much - and food and drink is still relatively cheap. It won't spoil your holiday when you get the 'extras' bill at the end of your stay!
We didn't try the spa treatments but I imagine they were the same high standard as the rest of the services. We saw some people having massages on their sunbeds and they looked good.
There is a free minibar in the room and this was re-stocked daily (including beer).
Honestly I cannot think of one fault with this hotel. In fact I can't think of anything that was less than perfect.
We will definitely be returning!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
253,Wish we could have stayed longer!,50,October 2019,"Perfect location for the most beautiful sunsets, huge pool, walking distance to all the great shops and restaurants. The live music was such a nice touch. The rooms were spacious and well designed, and the service couldn't have been better. We stayed at the Aman on the east side of Bali before this and were mad we didn't stay at the Legian the whole time instead because it was that much better.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
254,Just perfect,50,October 2019,"We had originally planned to stay
at the Legian for 7 nights and a further 6 nights in Ubud.

Our week at the Legian was just perfect. This all suite hotel clearly makes customer service and satisfaction it's primary goal.

The manager Alain is Swiss and runs this place like a Swiss timepiece. It slowly ticks along, but behind the front face is a calm efficiency that hides the hard work an effort that all the staff clearly make.

The restaurant staff, the pool guys, the cleaners, the security guards, the gardener's all have a smile on their face. You can't instruct staff to be like that, although it is the Balinese way.

We actually went to Ubud but after 2 nights we returned to the The Legian for our last 4 nights, and whilst it cost us s bit more it was worth every penny.

A truly exceptional hotel in every way.

If your going to Bail stay here you won't regret it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
255,Everest,50,November 2019,"Well what can I say when one has been coming to this great hotel for over 20 years and the service and quality of there food just keep getting better. The atmosphere and location and quality of there staff is the Everest of other hotels to compete against.
Mike and Annie Dodd",The Legian Seminyak Bali
256,Beautiful hotel and scenery,40,October 2019,"We have just got back home from visiting The Legian on a 5 day night stay after being in Australia. The hotel itself was lovely, the staff very friendly and can’t do enough for you and the pool area is just stunning with the infinity pools and the beach beyond with the relaxing sound of the waves. The only thing that lets this hotel down are the rooms (suites). We had a one bedroom studio suite which was spacious and comfortable with a lovely sea view but..... had a strong smell of damp as soon as you walked in, it was worse in the wardrobe where we were hanging clothes which then smelt of it. I understand with the climate in Bali being what it is it is probably difficult and the rooms are a little tired so there are gaps under the doors but... it is a ‘very expensive’ hotel, number one ranked in Seminyak and in the ‘Leading Hotels of the World book’ which is strongly advertised there so I really would not expect this from this standard of hotel and in that sense I think it very much let’s it down.
Overall lovely hotel and stay but the rooms need refurbishment and damp proofing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
257,A Truly Great Experience,50,June 2019,"I we could, we would be back again and again and again. In a extremely competitive market, this hotel stands out head and shoulders above all its peers.
Everything from the room to the service, a pool deck to die for, attention to detail... words cannot describe it.
One of the last of the world's great hotels....",The Legian Seminyak Bali
258,Outstanding,50,October 2019,"I have stayed in many hotels in Bali over the last 35 years but none have been set on such an amazing location. Yes, they have been on the beach but The Legian is designed so you can see and hear the beach from every angle.
The three infinity pools that fall into each over look straight into the waves. Our bedroom and porch area look straight into the waves too. It is stunning. The beach is immaculately clean and The Legian have hired life guards especially to man their part of the beach.

The rooms decor is opulent but comfortable which is exactly what a Bali hotel should be. One thing that stands out at The Legian is the massive size of the suites which have 2 toilets, massive bathroom area, bedroom dining and living area.

I have had 6 massages over the last 8 days but the others came nowhere near the massage I received at the Wellness spa from Partini. She did her magic with a new technique called the Whip massage. They use their whole arms and elbows. Believe me it was fantastic. The best massage I have ever had. The whip massage Is designed with the product they use called Ila. Ila also have a CD which they played while I was getting my massage. I liked it that much I wanted to buy it. Unfortunately they had sold out.

The food as expected was mouthwatering but as everyone else has mentioned in the other trip advisor reviews the service from the staff is outstanding.

Another thing I really like about The Legian is the size of the property. I think there is around 65 Suites and 20 villas. It’s not too big. You can always get a place at the swimming pools. Believe me, there are places in Bali (especially Nusa Dua area) that are 5 star but too busy in the pool areas.

The Legian is situated in Seminyak which has some of the best restaurant and shopping in Bali. That’s even more of a reason tho stay here.

Congratulations to Management and staff at The Legian, you are doing an amazing job.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
259,Superb hotel and service,50,October 2019,"We’ve been staying at many top hotels in Bali over the decades but this is the best by far! We are blown away by the excellent service and attention to details. A shoutout to the hardest working resort manager we have ever seen on our global travels - Alain Eggenschwiler - who popped by to say hello when we were checking in. He walks the grounds and chats with guests to get feedback every day. The hotel location is perfect - you fall asleep and wake up to sounds of the waves crashing. The food in the hotel is excellent - breakfast and dinner at The Restaurant is delicious and the free, daily afternoon tea (and local tea cakes) is perfect. We found ourselves looking forward to the local delicacies every day! The two-bedroom Seminyak Suite is spacious and perfect for families! It will be difficult to check out when it’s time to leave, but we are pleased to have found our new favourite Bali hotel! ❤️",The Legian Seminyak Bali
260,Perfect as always,50,October 2019,Returned for the 22nd time to our favorite hotel worldwide and a perfect stay as always.From check in to check out you are treated like royalty from every single member of staff. Great food especially the pizzas . High tea ( see photo) is also complimentary . Some of the staff we have known since our first visit in 2006 . Special thanks to Dayu for the welcoming smile at breakfast every morning and congratulations to Alain and Devy for their excellent management of the hotel. See you next year!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
261,Amazing !!!!,50,October 2019,"We absolutely loved the hotel - fantastic location and incredible attention to detail. Staff are so good and friendly , cannot speak highly enough of this property. Food and beverage was great , fantastic breakfast selection and the Seafood BBQ buffet on Friday night a must....were so sad to leave will definitely be back....",The Legian Seminyak Bali
262,Legian Bali vacation,50,October 2019,"We have just spent a week at The Legian in Seminyak, Bali. The Legion was a fantastic hotel. We had amazing service, staff were attentive, knew our names and could not do enough for us. The rooms were spacious, spotless and very comfortable. The food was great. Breakfasts were well prepared and presented with fantastic choices. We will definitely be returning! What a lovely experience!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
263,Beautiful Hotel with Amazing Service,50,October 2019,"The only way to describe this hotel is PERFECTION. Not only is the place gorgeous in an amazing location, the service is fit for a king, as is the food and drinks. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a luxury hotel in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
264,An amazing weekend getaway,50,October 2019,"Stayed in Suite 313. Lovely suite with a brilliant view. The suite was spacious and had separate living room, dining area, bedroom and lovely bathroom. Check in was smooth but although I had sent my passport copy to them prior to arrival I was still asked for my passport. Breakfast buffet was nice with a la carte items also offered. A great relaxing stay. Staff were excellent especially Denny at breakfast and Luh Sudiasih at Front Office.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
265,Top class,50,October 2019,"Excellent service at all levels: management, concierge, in-room cleaning, security, restaurants, outdoor, pool. You feel honored and respected. A great experience.we've been around the world in many places. This one is among the best. Very spacious suite.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
266,Awesome Customer Service!,50,September 2019,"WOW! I have stayed at many luxury hotels (Four Seasons many properties throughout the world including 2 in Bali, Peninsula Beijing-Shanghai-Bangkok-Tokyo, J K Place Florence & Rome, Goring Hotel London, Pulitzer Amsterdam, Dolder Grand Zurich, Ritz Carlton Kyoto, St Regis Florence, etc), but the Legian exceeds those hotels with their outstanding customer service. One memorable moment...without asking, they brought my beach lunch takeaway to my room where they set it up as though I was ordering room service. Impressive!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
267,Amazing Hotel,50,October 2019,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough.

We stayed in a 2-bedroom suite. It was very spacious and had plenty of room for myself and 2-children. The furnishings and fit out was beautiful. We were on the second floor and my only issue was our view of the ocean was slightly obstructed.

The staff at the hotel were amazing. The pool staff were so incredibly helpful making sure we had water, towels and food. They helped keep an eye on our children. The restaurant staff were very attentive and I can not fault their service. The staff on the concierge desk deserve extra special credit - they went above and beyond everyday to help book day trips, airport transfers and restaurants.

The hotel is located within walking distance to all of the Seminyak shops and great restaurants.

I will stay here again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
268,Beautiful,50,October 2019,"Beach was beautiful, food was delicious and the room was amazing. Comfortable and spacious. Better than expected. The service was extremely friendly and attentive. When I return to Bali, there is no question as to where I will stay. The Legian was a dream",The Legian Seminyak Bali
269,Brilliant hotel; service incredible,50,October 2019,Just a joy with a beautiful birthday cake thrown in! Didn’t even tell them it was my birthday... kindness and service were special. Location perfect and rooms beautiful. You’ll be happy here now matter what.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
270,Money Well Spent,50,October 2019,"This place may be overwhelming with pricing, but the money is definitely worth it. From the location, the service and the room, it was unbelievable.

If I need to leave a recommendation/suggestion, two things that I've observed.
1) Despite the hair dryer being functional, the dryer had very worned exterior/grip feeling. Possible upgrade would be nice.
2) The bath faucet initially release brownish/dirt color water which prevented us from utilizing the bath overall.

But again, the resort was beautiful and definitely coming back if I get a chance.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
271,Stunning,50,March 2019,"Love this resort.

The staff, the suites, the sunset bar, the restaurant are a shining example of first class service.

I would recommend this stunning resort to all.

The staff are exceptional as are the suites and the Spa.

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff",The Legian Seminyak Bali
272,A much needed break - unforgettable experience and hospitality,50,October 2019,"We made a last minute decision to take five day break from the day to day in Sydney booking the Legian in Seminyak. The hospitality both in the hotel and locally was unforgettable. As an entrepreneur with an interest in green based initiatives it was a reminder that many of the issues we face locally in Australia, from the elimination of single use plastics, ethical/sustainable production and access to clean usable water have an order of magnitude globally when taking into consideration the challenges in faced by developing countries. Looking forward to returning soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
273,Always Amazing,50,October 2019,"We have been staying at the Legian pretty much every year for past 14 yrs and it never fails to impress
No matter what level of staff you deal with the customer service is second to none
This trip I would particularly like to commend the pool staff. They could not be more attentive or helpful. Even ensuring the kids were shaded by the umbrellas.
The vista from the hotel is spectacular with sunsets that rival any in the world
We cannot recommend this hotel enough. The GM and mgmt staff listen to guests and care about your experience
I rate this hotel 10/10 for customer service, dining, housekeeping, maintenance, location and attention to detail
Thank you to the wonderful GM and all the staff",The Legian Seminyak Bali
274,Amazing all the way,50,October 2019,"Not only Bali is a magical place... The Legian makes it a dream come true!
The location right on the beach, the chic and confort in Balinese style of the hotel, the details to service makes it one of the top places ... making you feel welcome and special yet discreet...and the wonderful staff always here to help and make your stay the best you could even dream of. Once in a lifetime place to go ... if not every year!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
275,Still The Best Hotel In Bali,50,September 2019,"Although the Legian has been around for a long time it is still the best.
The staff are extremely professional, friendly & attentive.
The restaurant is just superb and the suites spacious, very clean and very well appointed.
Then there is the amazing pool with the ocean view.
There is nothing else you would want in this amazing place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
276,World Class,50,September 2019,"As soon as you arrive you sense they want to make this special for you. The greeting you receive on opening the taxi door is that of a distant relative that is being warmly welcomed home. You are personally escorted into the lobby and sat down in luxurious surroundings to check in. No standing in line at a checking desk. Someone pops over with a welcome local drink and some cold towels to refresh. Once the formalities of checking in are complete, you are given an informal guide to the facilities and then escorted to your suite, where your luggage is already waiting for you.
We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was luxuriously decorated, with high end fittings and extremely spacious, two balconies and lovely views of the beach and the sunsets. The location is also excellent, all sun beds are overlooking the beach which has very easy access from the hotel grounds. There are many hotels in the world with excellent facilities and views but its the service here that sets it apart. Every day they make you feel special from the greeting at breakfast, where daily a senior team member would introduce themselves and have a little chat to see how your stay is going, everyone is extremely friendly and nearly all would know your name and greet you accordingly. We are slightly out of high season in September and that may have afforded us a bit more attention than normal, but you know, somehow I don’t think that would be the case. This hotel would make you feel special what ever time of year you came.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
277,Beautiful holiday with awesome sunsets !,50,September 2019,"This is the first time we stayed at The Legian in Seminyak and certainly not going to be our last time as we had a wonderful holiday. We have to stress that the location of this hotel is wonderfully situated right on the beach with the most amazing sunset every evening when we were there and we were at the hotel for 7 nights! Not only is the location of the hotel ideally placed by the beach, it is also right near to all the shops and great restaurants in Seminyak. Having said about the location of the hotel, we also have to say the service was just superb, the team of staff were always available and they were never too busy for us and very friendly. From speaking to other guests this is one of those hotels that you keep coming back to as you will never be disappointed.

278,FEEL THE BEAUTY OF BALI FROM THE LEGIAN BALI,50,September 2019,"the suite is all ocean view , quiet spacious with balcony facing the sea, facility is excellent ,but the staff are amazing , they always care about you and eery one is friendly ,always ready to help the guest.
it is a 2 nights stay here,but i would like to spend some more time herea vocation well spent",The Legian Seminyak Bali
279,Superb Hotel,50,September 2019,"This is a superb property in every way. Service is impeccable. We were astonished at the personalization of the service. Employees remembered your name and asked how your day was snorkeling or touring. Food was very fresh and delicious. The amenities in the room were outstanding. Spa was a dream. In all regards this is a 5 start hotel.

It's an interesting location because The Legian Bali is a little slice of serene heaven in a very busy part of Bali. You would never know that when you are on the property. Outside the front gates is a ton of bustle, restaurants, clubs and shopping all within walking distance of the hotel. The chaos that excudes on these streets is polar opposite of the experience that you have inside the hotel.

We will return. Many thanks to the staff at The Legian Bali. They deserve the five star rating. :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
280,Incredible Week,50,September 2019,Service is best we have received in a long time with all staff incredibly attentive. An evening cocktail watching the sunset is a magical experience. One of the best hotels we have stayed at. We will be back,The Legian Seminyak Bali

282,Understated luxury with impeccable service,50,September 2019,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Legian as part of our 20th anniversary celebration. From the moment we entered the property to the moment we departed we experienced amazingly personal, warm service. Staff were attentive to all of our needs, and the “soft” touches (incense outside our room every evening, a fully stocked gratis minibar) were icing on the cake. The property is gorgeous and beautifully kept, and the food was fantastic (listening to live gamelan music every morning during breakfast was lovely). I do hope to return to Bali someday, if only to stay again at the Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
283,Special Touches of service,50,September 2019,"I can't say enough about all the little special touches this hotel does, to go out of their way to make you feel special. Desserts and wine sent to the room, (unsolicited) Treats throughout the day at the pool (including iced towels scened in plumeria and iced cucumber water), everything was top notch when it comes to service and attention to details. Security was excellent. Unparalleled to anything I've seen in the US. The only issue I had was that the bed was a bit hard, but a down mattress was brought up immediately to remedy the situation. It was just heaven to spend a few days of vacay here. Would highly recommend to the most discrimination guest.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
284,perfect on every level,50,September 2019,"just spent a truly wonderful 6 days at this hotel.I cannot recommend it enough.

It was 5 Star service all the way, The staff are all so friendly and super professional. I was made to feel very welcome, like a return guest, although it was my first time. Definitely not my last. Just an amazing spot, you will not want to leave.
Thank you to the Manager Hans Meier and Devy Anggun, for making my staying even more memorable.
Already planing to book to come back with my husband in February to enjoy Valentines day at this very Romantic Hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

288,Warm elegance,50,September 2019,"A two decade old building that is very well maintained with very warm, contemporary, and comfortable interiors. The gym is spectacular, and so is the spa. They have a plunge pool and a lap pool, both overlooking the Indian Ocean. The staff is overwhelmingly courteous, polite, professional, and supportive. The location is spot on the beach, in crowded, and in walking distance to trendy restaurants and streets. The food is also superb.
Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
289,Very nice hotel,50,September 2019,"Great ocean views, very good service, good location. Food is good, rooms very comfortable and elegant. A most enjoyable stay. It is close to Seminyak Square, only a 5 - 10 mins walk yet away from the hustle and bustle of the busy streets.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
290,Excellent,50,September 2019,"This was our second stay at this hotel and it was as good as the first time. The hotel building itself is beautiful and you cannot fault the rooms. The staff though are what sets this hotel apart - they are friendly, attentive and highly competent. The guest focus is amazing, the attention to detail and all the little extras make you feel welcome, relaxed and totally pampered.
We will return!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
291,Everything was just Perfect,50,August 2019,"Wonderfull hotel on the beach , with Wonderfull staff. Excellent food, best breakfast, stunning view on the ocean. Nothing to complain about. Very central location in Seminyak so walking distance from many good restaurants so great to avoid Bali Traffic.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

We always want to come back here again and again. Love the room, the beach, breakfast, butler service and its location within walking distance to seminyak square shopping area and many good restaurants. Almost everything.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Its great bubble of tranquility .the service is wonderfull. Management is hands on .you can feel their commitment from morning till.night. the manager of f/ b even helped us score a booking in a very busy resteraunt outside the hotel.nothing is to hard. Little touches like after noon tea or canopes with drinks are really welcome and show a giving side.great experience great hotel.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
295,The best hotel choice we've ever made!,50,May 2019,"We deliberated over what area & then what hotel we would stay in for a month before booking & the 'Legian' was worth the effort on every level. The staff were so attentive & friendly they weren't just a credit to the hotel but the people of Bali in general & I felt this was born out of real caring & not just duty.The rooms were spacious, the food at breakfast & dinner was first rate & the personal touches like remembering your name & what breakfast you like after only a day was really classy. It's difficult to single out individuals but Anggun the senior assistant manager & Dewi the concierge were not just helpful & professional but both were genuinely really beautiful people. I have recommended to others who are thinking of Bali as a destination to stay at the 'Legian' & if I return I will do the same.Thank you to all the staff & even the security guys who stand in hot sun all day, make you feel compfortable & even stop traffic if you want to cross the road from the hotel. Amazing place I must revisit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
296,"Lovely, but not perfect",40,August 2019,"The good first:
1. A lovely beach position and a hotel with comprehensive facilities
2. A hotel with considerable Balinses style and charm
3. Exceptionally friendly and welcoming staff who don't know the word 'impossible'
4. Á highly visible and engaged Swiss management team
The not so good:
1. Restaurant service is slow and staff (English) language competence varies enormously
2. Daily, changing 'specials' might encourage more guests to dine-in
2. Our bathroom lacked a make-up mirror and adequate lighting (for shaving/make-up)
Other observations:
1. Infra-structure is a problem and traffic generally a nightmare. A journey of around 10 kms to Denpasar Airport can take up to an hour dependent on the time of day
2. Seminyak is hardly picturesque with an (over.crowded) jumble of boutiques, hotels, 'places-to-be' and tourists. Visitors seeking quiet with Balinese charm should look elsewhere
Viator Coloniae",The Legian Seminyak Bali
297,Bespoke hospitality in a beautiful setting with first class service and incredible attention to detail.,50,August 2019,"Bespoke Balinese hospitality in a beautiful hotel. Incredible setting with an idyllic beachfront location in the heart of ‘buzzing’ Seminyak. Highly trained attentive staff, from your first greeting checking into the hotel, to the restaurant staff , to the service staff who all personalised your stay by knowing you by name and greeting you personally. The pool/beachside staff were the amongst the most attentive I have ever known from the minute you arrive with towels for your chair, constant refreshments, cold towels and water sprays! Definitely recommend this hotel if you want to be spoilt and relax in the heart of Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
298,Exceptional. Our new home away from home.,50,July 2019,"If you are seeking an uncomplicated, memorable beach getaway with wonderful staff, accommodations and food, it has to be The Legian. Thank you to Hans and team for creating such memories. See you next year.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
299,Amazing,50,July 2019,Stayed two nights at The Legian in July in our honeymoon and it was amazing. The property is very well kept and the service is stellar. The breakfast was delicious as well. The pool area is as pictured: beautiful and right on one of the best areas of the beach. It is a pricey stay but well worth it. Highly recommend!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
300,Still a favorite,50,August 2019,"This is my first trip in 4 years back to Bali and decided to stay at the Legian (again). The hotel treated me like a return family member.

301,Always the best,50,August 2019,"We've been going to The Legian for a long time and I don't have much to add to previous reviews.

303,Two words” The Best”,50,July 2019,"Everything about this hotel is what other hotels should strive for. This should be the bench mark. Superlatives apply to everything- the suite, all of the staff, the food, the gardens, the pools. There are no better people than the Balinese. For everything to be so perfect the management must be exceptional.
My wife and I have stayed at many Leading hotels of the World over many years. The Legian is up there with the top 3 or 4",The Legian Seminyak Bali
304,Amazing!!!!,50,July 2019,"This hotel is amazing! The staff, grounds, food -- It's all so good. We did not want to leave. Close enough to the shops that you can walk. The beach is really nice and there is a lifeguard on duty. Never felt like I had to rush to get seats at the pool or beach. Plenty to be had.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
305,Fabulous as always,50,July 2019,"Loved this trip. thought last year was wonderful, but this year was even better.
The great staff from Hans the manager, to Budi by the pool, the world class spa girls, breakfast by the pool served by the most beautiful people and all the other wonderful employees, make this place very special indeed. They remember your name, know your drink and what you like for breakfast.
Love sunset drinks or the lovely offerings that come to you as you sit and soak up the sun or just rest under the palm trees looking as the waves roll in.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
306,One of the best beach holiday experiences we have ever had!!,50,July 2019,"Situated on a private stretch of beautiful beach front the Legian Hotel is a total indulgent beach holiday experience. We stayed in a Deluxe one bedroom suite and we were most impressed with the tasteful decor combining both elegance and comfort to the highest level. The food in the hotel is wonderful and the beach bar was amazing at night time and Irba the bar manager was always there to greet with a welcome smile. The staff at the Legian were so nice and its a credit to Hans, Alain, Ann goon,Eddy and all the management team making our stay one that we will remember for a long time to come. We are looking forward to the opening of the new Legian hotel on Lombok and hope to travel back in the next couple of years! Thank you for a most wonderful holiday :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
307,The Best Resort in Bali,50,July 2019,"As returning guest , The Legian is always been the first choice of our place to stay. The best well establish classic and well maintain resort in Bali. Upon check in the resident manager welcoming us. All staff always give their smile and greet us. Out suite served with high tea sweets and coffee. All suites are ocean view. Breakfast is by the beach served with the best French Toast. Not to mentioed I have the best Legian spa. We are sure will return on our next vacation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
308,An Amazing Hotel with Exceptional Service,50,March 2019,"Completely blown away with The Legian Suite, with its XL Terrace overlooking the pool and ocean facing. Service was exceptional... 6 Star Service!!! 1 family member got sick and the hotel sent a Dr up to the Suite promptly. The pool is totally amazing. What a location! Hans the Manager is such a personable man, and is such a delight to talk to. It's a tight knit Management Team that run this hotel with Superior Standards. I cannot wait for my next stay there. A perfect retreat to the room, after a big walk around the busy streets of Seminyak. Location Plus with its shortcut straight up to Seminyak Square. I celebrated my birthday there, and my husband organised the Degustation Dinner (11 courses) which was totally mind blowing. The Red Dragonfruit Pavlova is mouth watering, and that birthday will never be forgotten. Thank you to all the staff at The Legian. Simply amazing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
309,World Class Perfection,50,July 2019,"As a result of a last minute itinerary change, my husband and I recently spent part of our honeymoon at The Legian, and boy are we happy we did! We have stayed at other Leading Hotels of the World, but The Legian is in a class of its own. The rooms are gorgeous, restaurant delicious, pools beautiful, view breathtaking, and grounds immaculate BUT what truly makes The Legian a world class hotel is its STAFF. They are some of the warmest, kindest, hospitable people whose service is surpassed by none. Every single staff member knew our names, that it was our honeymoon and that my husband had a shrimp allergy without us ever mentioning it. They remembered what particular day beds or restaurant tables we liked and did their best to accommodate us, they were attentive with all requests, surprised us with complementary juices and ice creams and even provided incense outside our room in the evening so that when we returned, it smelled beautifully. Simply stated, they treat you like royalty. Our experience at The Legian was so amazing I cried as they escorted us to our driver (a first for me!). We hope to have the good fortune to return!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
310,Gives others in Bali a run for their money,50,July 2019,"Stylish, smart and a well-oiled machine that hums along in a breathtakingly efficient and appropriate way, The Legian fulfils everything. It’s a few years since we last stayed and have been doing so for many, but things have ramped up at this beautiful middle-aged Lady. Not quite Ibu yet, her well worn, characteristically comfortable and warm poise now has a charming patina that is immaculate.
Thanks to a far-sighted GM and his excellent team of staff.
Others in Bali could learn much.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
311,Fantastic location and service!,50,July 2019,"Loved staying at The Legian and will be going back for sure. We had been at the Six Senses in Ulluwatu first and then to the Legian. The Six Senses is very new and the Legian very mature and it shows in every aspect. The Legian has been doing this a long time, it’s service is impeccable. From arrival, we are made to feel special and the personal service at every step from breakfast to the pool was perfect. The location on the beach, near lots of shops and restaurants make it ideal. There’s almost no point in hitting the beach clubs when you have such a wonderful pool, service and beach location. The rooms are nice, and yes they are getting old but are still nice, comfortable and have been modernized where it matters (Bose sound system, usb wall chargers). Breakfast was good, buffet with a la carte options. I didn’t try the restaurant other than breakfast, there are loads of other options on the door step.

Overall, we loved the hotel and everything about it. I will be back to the Legian for more in future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
312,Utterly relaxing with superb service,50,July 2019,"A family holiday in 2 adjacent rooms. Rooms were fantastic. Food was excellent and catered really well for vegan, vegetarian and pescatarian diets ... we are a difficult family! Service was superb, personal and friendly. I was blown away when everyone seemed to know my name after 1 day. Clearly well organised management and friendly teamwork. Location right on the beach is so relaxing with the sound of crashing waves to lull you to sleep.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
313,Wonderful!,40,July 2019,"Very convenient location, to shops, entertainment and restaurants.
Exceptional hotel, food and facilities, which exceeded all my expectations from the point of view of a first time visitor to The Legian. Staff were very professional. Mini bar re-stocked each day at no charge. The afternoon tea (high tea style) served each afternoon by the pool, at no extra charge, was exceptional.
The beach was very clean and security tight for non-guests.

The only disappointment was when we accidentally left an engraved hip flask behind, it could not be found the next day by any staff member, including management.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
314,Beautiful Rooms and Views,50,July 2019,"We just returned from the Legian Seminyak. The room we had (222) was huge - large sitting area, dining area, mini kitchen, huge bathroom and an additional toilet/powder room, a beautiful balcony with a sitting area and dining area and like all the rooms -- ocean facing and lovely views. The room was very relaxing, spacious, lovely. Wifi was strong. And the housekeeping staff were attentive and did a great job. The minibar drinks and snacks are free and are refilled once a day (here i wish they would have seen that we were only drinking coke zeros and bintangs and given a few more of those.. rather than the sugary drinks and juices -- but these are minor suggestions)

The location is perfect -- a 200 meter walk into the center of Seminyak through a safe alley that is free of traffic. Also a perfect place on the beach -- not too noisy or overcrowded but still an area that is swimmable, and well placed to visit the unique beach clubs of Seminyak -- we went to Mano (very close by) and Potato Head -- the food was great at both places. We walked down to Ku De Ta but decided to skip the crowd.

Areas for improvement -- the breakfast was just ok. I would skip the breakfast and head into town because there were so many restaurants with excellent breakfast options.

As to food in town -- we loved Kilo, Sisterfields (lunch and breakfast). Loads of care and love in that food., Mamasan, Funny place for drinks - Red Carpet. Just go. you'll see.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
315,Superb service in very pleasant surroundings,50,July 2019,"What stands out about the hotel is the absolutely impeccable and professional service. One of the best I ever had.

The hotel itself is a great place, very well located, with an excellent pool and a most enjoyable restaurant. The rooms are large and comfortable and very well equipped. The minibar is complementary. Perhaps some of the furniture is getting a bit dated, but all is very functional.

One footnote: we were there on the 16th of July when an earthquake of 5.7 magnitude with epicentre at about 100 km from Seminyak happened. The quake was somewhat scary, but the good news is that the hotel seems to be well built and there was no noticeable damage at all. That provides a safe feeling!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
316,Welcome Home,50,July 2019,"If you don’t love the Legian, it’s not the hotel, there’s something wrong with you.
Thank you to the entire team for a wonderful holiday.
Many thanks for always welcoming us home, it’s the most beautiful hotel in Seminyak to stay.

317,The best resort in seminyak,50,July 2019,"First trip with our 7 month old baby in this great hotel or I should call home away from home. We stayed in the deluxe suite which had sea front view all over ( except from the bath room).

Room:

Very family friendly layout with a kitchen and separate wc in the living. Balcony was nice and spacious with an awesome view. Very well maintained for a 23 years old property. Bed was very comfy I slept so well over our 5 days stay. And the pillow was very high quality ( I use a Hungarian goose down feather at home ). We asked for extra bed for our helper and of course a baby cot which were all well set up.

Service:

TOP notch service all around from room service , dining , spa to the door men. The resort definitely have customer experience focus engrained in everything they do. I was ill during my stay and the restaurant manager dayu noticed my discomfort and immediately prepared porridge. The assist manager anggu then arrange for a resident doctor house call which aids in my recovery. At the time of writing, I am feeling better and all thanks to the attentiveness of the staffs!

Surrounding:

Strategically located in center seminyak, you have direct access to the beach ( and a very nice part) and at the same time remain very close to the centre of action surrounded by restaurants and shops. While the resort seems to be running at full occupancy , everything is well spread out we always manage to find out little area to hangout. As for the pool, it is temperature controlled so the water remain a comfortable 29 degrees not to mention 3 heights all with infinity view. The steam room in the spa is also well built and refurbished to your comfort. We felt the jacuzzi could be a bit warmer and the jet stream stronger.

Activities :

Joined the complimentary yoga session which is one of the best practice for me of late. The whole environment was just so conducive as we practiced at the lawn while meditating to the waves. We did not get to participate in the spin class we i was ill. The studio did look inviting. As for kids they actually have a dedicated kids lounge which will be helpful traveling family.

Summary:

This is one resort which i felt like seriously planning for a return visit. We have always been sampling new resorts whenever we travel to Bali but the legian is seriously challenging that convention:)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
318,Always good to be back at The Legian !,50,July 2019,"The Legian is one of the classic, stylish and peaceful hotel in Bali that you keep on coming back to. I've known The Legian for nearly 20 years and I have to say, it is always with great pleasure that I come back. The location is great, long morning beach walks with sunrise... to perfect spectacular & entertaining sunsets....everyday a new one ! The Pool and Beach area is superb. The gym and spa has been greatly up-graded. Yoga morning session on the lawn listening to the rhythm of the waves, Pilates, Spinning... The Legian is going along with the healthy life style trend without compromising on great cocktail hours for sunset. Great choice for families too. Plenty to do around. And the endless beach access.... The staff is superb, the service excellent. Always a smile and a nice attention. The Legian Team knows how to make you feel ""special"". A classy classic !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
319,Super Luxurious Pool Villa at The Club at The Legian,50,July 2019,"Stayed at The Club at The Legian in Seminyak and was stunned by every single fine thing. Arrived at the Club lounge and met by personal butler , check in was just one minute and ushered immediately to our pool villa. The pool villa is so generous in size and Balinese contemporary style in design, the manicured Balinese garden, the spacious living room, the bedroom is so elegant , the bathroom with outdoor oversized bathtub is so sexy. And the Italian Acqua di Parma amenities are superb. Everything is so immaculate, the details in the villa , the upkeep was top notch. The privacy of the villa is high yet the location is just minutes away from the shopping haven Seminyak square. Afternoon was indulging, the butler came with delicious sweets and savories and our favorite tea. We could not help it but finished all those deliciously made little bites by their resident chef. It seemed that we were so pampered as there was 2 mini bars and fully stocked with drinks and snacks and everything was prepared for us. Evening was so romantic when the butler did the turn down, he closed all the white drapes that function as mosquito nets and that made our bed looked so chic and beautiful. We enjoyed every single piece of local art adorning the villa and the surroundings and we felt like somehow staying in the romantic,luxurious villa with semi museum touches. The facilities are amazing, the main pool in front of the Club lounge is so huge that you could do real swimming exercise and it is so good even we stayed at The Club at The Legian, we were given access to the other ocean front infinity swimming pools located at The Legian just opposite The Club and we got ferried by their 24 hours buggy driven by butler at anytime we wish to go. We would highly recommend The Club at The Legian for those who would like to splurge in the high end villa property with butler service and looking into privacy. Definitely one of the best in the island !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
320,Outstanding beachfront hotel,50,June 2019,"We were extremely impressed by The Legian. The facilities are exquisite - we stayed in a palatial 2BR suite that was modern, lavishly equipped, and filled with Balinese art, and the outdoor areas are beautifully manicured with ocean views to die for. Despite being a mid-sized to large hotel, the Legian managed to preserve a sense of intimacy, with all of the staff greeting us by name on a regular basis (not sure how they did that) and regular visits by the manager. Breakfast in the restaurant was outstanding. The beach is picturesque, though the surf and riptides prevented us from swimming while we were there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
321,Fantastic stay - highly recommended!,50,July 2019,Fantastic stay at the Legian Club Villas which were spacious and had a private pool with outdoor bath tub. The facilities at the resort were great - in particular the three pools and the sun deck area to spend an afternoon sipping Happy Hour and enjoying the ocean view right in front of us with direct access to the beach. Staff were friendly and very accommodating to all of our needs. This resort is in prime location with a short car ride away from the city centre with shops and restaurants! Would highly recommend this resort!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
322,Return Guests- Fantastic!,50,June 2019,"We are return guests at the Legian, and it won’t be our last stay. The accommodations are beautiful. From the regal dignity of the hotel to the beach views to the floral and fauna and stone Balinese statues, throughout the property everywhere you turn is beautiful and peaceful. But while the hotel and setting are gorgeous, it is truly the staff that breaths spirit and heart into the Legian experience. Every associate we encountered was truly gracious, giving and quick to give a heartfelt smile. It was a joy to see familiar faces and be remembered. A wonderful surprise was that the Legian acquired a new executive chef Chef Stephane Gortina from Nice is SUPERB! His creations were absolutely delicious and visually exquisite. His kitchen’s use locally sourced products ensured that meals were bursting with flavor. We truly look forward to enjoying his meals again and the genuine hospitality of the Legian team. Kudos to the wonderful management that created an environment where their associates are happy, which spills over to genuine and beautiful interactions with guests.
Practical points: the suites are huge and well appointed. The beds and bedding are infinitely comfortable. The dining...well, see above! (Though I must mention that the breakfasts are extraordinarily good!) The multilevel infinity pool is beautiful and inviting. Afternoon tea service is a complete delight. The concierge team is always efficient with answers and offers excellent suggestions for touring, etc. The spa is luxurious and its staff are incredibly professional and well trained. Housekeeping as with our last visit, was professional, efficient, and maintained out suite in the highest standards. Finally, the beautiful Balinese music wafting in the air throughout the day is a sheer delight!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
323,The ultimate in hotel luxury & service,50,July 2019,"The Legian Bali is an extraordinary hotel. I have visited 5 times over the past 8 years or so & it just never disappoints & yet leaves me wanting to return whenever I can. The fit out is tasteful & luxurious whilst maintaining a balinese charm. The setting is beautiful & the location perfect (on the beach, close to all the action of Seminyak in terms of restaurants & shopping & yet safe, quiet & very protected...a serene haven. The food is 5 star & the service is simply faultless. Morning yoga on the lawn, long lazy breakfasts over looking the water, a day reading a book on one of the amazingly comfy poolside day beds (there are ALWAYS enough.. unlike so many hotels of its kind).. just the thought of it all makes me want to return only a few days after leaving! It's not a cheap option but somehow it feels worth every cent!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
324,Amazing experience...,50,July 2019,"Dear Alain and Legian Team,
Thank you so much for such an amazing experience and hospitality. The resort is blessed with stunning views and well kept villas ideal for family / couple holiday. Located in the heart of Seminyak yet so calm and peaceful. Will Highly recommend to all my FnF.
Thanks again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
325,A Top Hotel in the World,50,July 2019,"The Legian Bali is an extremely well run 5-star operation. It leaves nothing to complain about at all, it’s simply great. We stayed at The Club, which offers a non-ocean front, but more private and upscale Villa type experience.

Upon arrival, front and center, the airport greeter met us and escorted us to our driver. At the hotel we met our butler, he was amazing from start to finish. I don’t like to post names publicly, but if management wants to reach out, I would gladly give you his name, he deserves recognition. At the same time, you're assisted by multiple other staff members. Doors of the car opened, welcome drink delivered, everything was run extremely efficiently. The arrival was nothing short of amazing, admittedly, I was blown away. I have stayed in other well rated resorts around the world, and their inability to monitor flight times or adjust to travel issues always astonishes me – the Legian did not have this problem, they are well trained professionals.

The main lobby of the club was great, beautiful pool, attentive staff, and just a really serene environment. It, like the rest of the main hotel’s grounds, are beautiful and well managed. The grounds are absolutely spotless, from the beach front area restrooms to the check-in – it all has a wow factor.

The Villa itself was absolutely stunning. The villa has everything you might need, and the grounds are huge, it’s really remarkable. Soaps, shampoos, and toiletries are all top of the line and plentiful. The layout is amazing, and everything is spotless and clean. Fully stocked with anything you might need, from coffee, refreshments and alcohol to an IPOD with nearly 15k songs on it. The villa features traditional music playing throughout and sets a super calm mood.

Service was really incredible and something that isn’t seen very often. The whole team seems to be operating on the same page, they know your name, what Villa you’re at and all the little details to make a stay special. It is a real exercise in relaxing yet efficient service. Breakfast, happy hour, all flawless whether in the Villa, Club Lobby, or main hotel. The attention to detail is as good as I have seen and if you like that type of thing, you’ll love this hotel.

It’s one of those places that if I didn’t enjoy it, I would hopefully recognize that it’s me that’s the problem, not my environment. This place is absolutely top notch.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
326,RESTAURANT,50,June 2019,"We treated ourselves to dinner at The Legian Restaurant and were totally blown away by the service we received here. Although the food was very expensive, we knew that going in, and the food itself did not disappoint. The extensive wine list was fantastic. A traditional Balinese dance performance was a lovely surprise to keep us entertained and the views out to the ocean were spectacular. Definitely somewhere you go as a very special “treat” as $60NZD for a small (but absolutely delicious and amazing) steak was a little hard to comprehend. We thought of the expense as an overall experience however, with the view, service, performance, food and atmosphere - it is somewhere I will treat myself to again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
327,Amazing! :),50,June 2019,"The Legian is a beautiful Hotel and offers a very warm and embracing energy, which is a reflection of the good people who work there.
We thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality, cuisines and the amazing facilities very much.
I had a wonderful time as did my new family.
THANK YOU!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
328,Amazing Beach Hotel!,50,June 2019,"Staying at the Legian was absolutely incredible. From the views of the Indian Ocean from the suite, to the onsite food and incredibly attentive staff, this resort went above and beyond. We came here for our honeymoon and could not have asked for anything else. The spa here is also world class (both the spa appointments along with the steamroom/suana/jacuzzi combination available to all guests). Highly recommend anyone looking for a relaxing beach stay in Bali to look here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
329,Bali holiday,50,June 2019,"We Stayed in the Club. The airport transfer was fast and efficient. Reception at the Club was very warm and friendly. It took only minutes that we could enjoy the privacy of our Villa. Throughout our stay, we have been well taken care of and any of our wishes or questions have been attended to immediately and always with a smile. The staff and service is outstanding! The pool Villa was very well maintained, although we found it a bit dark inside the Villa. Furniture was clean but coming a bit into the years. But this is complaining on high level. We truly enjoyed our stay and it cannot be mentioned often enough, this was to a large extent due to the fantastic, always smiling and helpful staff. The property is well maintained, professionally managed and the right choice for anybody looking for tranquility in a perfect environment.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
330,Family holiday,50,June 2019,"We stayed at the Legian for one week and I have to say the staff and facilities are absolutely amazing. The accommodation was absolutely superb and everything had been thought of, from fresh fruit and snacks to luxurious bathroom products and super comfy beds!
Every member of staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly and the food was to die for.
An amazing hotel and a truly beautiful resort. We will return. Thank you all 🌟",The Legian Seminyak Bali
331,The only Bali I want to know about,50,June 2019,"As chaotic as Bali can be, The Legian is a perfect oasis in the midst of it all.
Located close to any action you fancy in Seminyak but really it’s difficult to justify leaving the premises. Every thing you need is there and the quality is superior to any thing you seek beyond the walls of the hotel.
Service, cleanliness and quality was superb. Restaurant is first class. And of course the location and setting is as good as any in the world.
I look forward to staying here again whenever I visit Bali. Indeed The Legian is the only reason and part of Bali I wish to visit.
A perfect getaway.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
332,Everything we expected and more,50,June 2019,"Not our first time here but you always worry, will it live up to expectations.... well no issue there... this is a 6 star, amazing place, great team, rooms, food ... location everything is perfect .. can’t wait till we come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
333,"Awesome place, a truly luxurious experience",50,June 2019,"You know when sometime hotels have 5 stars and then you get there and you think this totally doesn’t deserve that! Well, you won’t experience that at The Legian.

Customers are put at the very center and every single employer makes you feel welcome, appreciated and unique.

Thank you guys for taking care of us and make our holiday special. We look forward to Ben there again sometime!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
334,21 st Visit,50,June 2019,"This was our 21st visit to this hotel and it just keeps on getting better. A well oiled machine running to perfection in all areas. Just go there and experience what the term "" customer satisfaction"" means, Thanks to Devy, Luh, Sardita and whole team for looking after us so well. Visit number 22 already planned!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
335,Outstanding Hotel,50,June 2019,I recently stayed at the Legian with my family in one of their two bedroom suites. The service was simply excellent. Their detailed attention to hospitality revival any five star hotel in the world. The food was excellent. The spa treatment was awesome. The hotel an exclusive feel without being pretentious or stuffy. Beautiful evening sunsets. Great afternoon's high tea. I love to complain and point out short cummings but I have nothing praise for this place.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
336,The Very Best in Seminyak,50,June 2019,"This hotels deserves to be ranked the best luxury resort in Seminyak Bali.

The hotel is situated in one of the best locations in Seminyak and the hotel grounds is just absolutely stunning. All suites were spacious, service is flawless and the pool always had a great ratio of guests where it’s never crowded or too busy.

What really shined about this hotel is their level of service. If I can give a perfect 10, they should get 11/10!

The hotel helped me get a taxi to a restaurant in Kuta, the payment should have been 80,000 RP but because we are not familiar with the currency the driver asked us to over pay 4x the fare and only to realize this when we returned to the hotel.

The hotel could have said “sorry can’t do much about it” and we didn’t expect much as it is beyond their control as they only helped me waved down a taxi. But the staff at Legian went above and beyond to hunt down that taxi driver via their CCTV and actually got the taxi driver to come back to the hotel and refund the overcharge! Clearly this was an oversight on my end as I should have been more diligent and aware, but the hotel’s outstanding service just blew us away!

Their attentive service from their bell boy, to front desk to the beach waiters definitely shines and Alain, the Resort Manager attempts to greet and meet all hotel guests each morning at breakfast hours. They even remember how my husband and I like to take our coffee in the morning and even serves a complimentary afternoon tea for their guests daily.

The room: Our two bedroom suite is only steps away from the beach and you can see the infamous pink sunset directly from your room with minimal obstructions.

The Legian won our hearts and we will definitely be back very soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
337,4 Days of Superb Service,50,April 2019,"There is little to say to those who have ever been to The Legian, they should know what I am about to say. But to those who have not, you have not experienced hospitality. The key to a good holiday, in my opinion, is the staff appreciating that you as a guest are in their charge for the time in which they come into contact with you. Hans Joerg Meier of the Legian has clearly trained his staff to realise this. Every step we took was confronted with Hospitality, however not strangled by it. The staff knew when to step back, yet when asked, nothing was too much trouble. I could not recommend both the culinary experience in league with the service we received, more highly. Thank you to Hans and his staff.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
338,Heaven on earth,50,June 2019,"We spent 5 nights at The Legian last week and if I can I will return time and time again. There is no other hotel I would consider. Service, experience, location, setting, quality and food all exceeded my expectations and there was nothing to fault at all. The kids were welcomed and felt comfortable even though this is a high end luxury resort. Our room was spacious and magnificent with a massive en suite, beautiful terrace with day bed where we could enjoy the sunset and the direct ocean view. Easy access from the beach to Ku de Ta and La Lucciola and an easy walk to all the main restaurants strips of Seminyak. So never too far to walk for a beautiful meal. Majority of the staff have been with the hotel since is opened and this really makes a difference with your experience within the hotel. True luxury with discreet, attentive service and the best bircher muesli I have ever had!!!! Cannot wait to return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
339,The best hotel I have ever been,50,June 2019,"Everything is just perfekt: from the service, the room, the Spa, the swimming pool or the food.
We are just happy and can recommend THE LEGIAN anytime and anyone.
We are happy to com back again in the future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
340,So many great memories of the Legian,50,October 2018,"This is part of the leading hotels of the world collection and, like all other lhw we have stayed at, is absolute luxury and beyond our expectations.
The staff were kind and accommodating. The ambience was tranquil, beautiful and relaxing. The morning yoga was excellent. Would stay here again and again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
341,Mr,50,June 2019,This was my first stay at a Legian but my fourth time in wonderful Bali and in Indonesia overall. The staff and service was everything I expect in Bali. The people in Bali are the sweetest people and the Legian was no exception. Everyone was great. Their spa was as good as they come. In the spa the receptionist were great and the massages were the best ever and I’ve had many. Because of my experience at the Legian Bali in Seminyak I would certainly try another one of their hotels.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
342,WOW WOW WOW - Amazing LHW hotel,50,May 2019,"Hotel overview:
Top class 5* hotel located on the beach with direct access, in a great area of Seminyak.
It is an all-suite hotel with private pool villas available, which means you have extremely spacious rooms, with all the facilities you would require.
Everything is pristine at this hotel from the pool area to the gardens.
The Restaurant is in an amazing setting with the most beautiful views.
The hotel also has security guards at the front and back of the hotel to ensure no-one enters the hotel, whom are not staying at the hotel. They are polite, professional and make everyone rinse the sand off their feet before entering the pool area.
I requested late check-out as our flight wasn’t until midnight and we were allowed to keep out room until we left at 8pm at no extra charge, which was full appreciated.

Hotel location and area:
The Legian is set in a great area of Seminyak, close to many well-known brands of restaurant’s, coffee shops and retail shops. We walked through an amazing market to get to the shopping mall and didn’t seem to get hassled by locals selling things, like other areas in Bali. It’s a 5 minute walk along the beach to Ku De Ta, which is a popular place for cocktails, whilst watching the famous sunset and do the best pizza.

Staff:
World-class, the staff at the hotel go above and beyond to ensure you have a pleasant stay. They all knew my name and would refer to me as Miss Delve, which I believe is extremely professional and polite.
The hotel manager would walk around the restaurant at breakfast to speak to all the guests to see how their stay is going and to talk about their holiday. They knew exactly which guests to approach and which guests preferred to be left alone.

Food:
Breakfast was delicious, and the buffet was fully covered at all times to ensure no flies landed on the food. This is a big thing for me, as I don’t usually eat buffet food, when it has not been covered. We could order what we liked for breakfast and it would be freshly made for us. Top rating on the food there.
Lunch by the pool was superb and exactly the food we enjoy.
We went to Motel Mexicana for dinner one night and decided to leave after a small starter, as it was too packed in there. So we headed back to the hotel and sat in the restaurant at 10:30pm and they cooked whatever we fancied on the menu, even though they were closing for the night.
Afternoon tea was a pleasant surprise, as the waitress came over to us sunbathing on the beach bed at 3.30pm and asked whether we would like afternoon tea. Of course I said yes, as I absolutely love afternoon tea and toughly enjoyed it, as it was a proper pot of tea too with a 3 tied stand including a small sandwich and cake. Just perfect.

Room:
WOW what an amazing one bedroom suite we had with a beautiful view and direct access to the gardens / pool area and beach. The room was thoroughly cleaned daily and extremely comfortable. Best night sleep on the hotel.
Bathroom was beautiful and just had to have a bath on the last night, as it just looked so inviting with the candles.
The complimentary minibar was such a great advantage, as it was fully stocked daily and we could enjoy some snacks / drinks in the room, whilst we got ready to go out.

Cleanliness:
Every area of the hotel and rooms were perfectly pristine and not a cleaner / cleaning trolley in sight, which was great. Not sure how they do it but there are doing it completely right.

Airport transfers: the transfer from The Legian to the airport was superb. We were provided with cold towels and water when we got in the car, we had Wifi in the car the whole time and there was a of staff waiting for us at the airport to open our card door and assist with our bags. Perfectly efficient service.

Summary:
I literally has no words for this little Balinese gem apart from WOW WOW WOW.
I loved this hotel so much that I could have easily extended our stay by a week, if I didn’t have commitments back home.
Absolutely stunning hotel which I will be staying at again in the future, when I visit Bali next. This was by far the best hotel we visited in Bali and by far my absolute favourite hotel worldwide.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

345,Back Again,50,June 2019,"This must be the best there is in Bali. Definitely in Seminyak. Our 2nd trip here with two years ago being our first.

The warm and sincere hospitality and excellent all-round service is one of the best in the world. They know who you are and make effort to remember what you like and the way you like it.

The room is very clean and extremely comfortable. The breakfast has very good selection too. The complimentary hotel tea is a nice touch.

Poolside service is the best too. Attentive and so obliging. Love the pools.

This is really a wonderful place. Will be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
346,Old World Charm and Highly Personalized Service,50,June 2019,"We booked a 2 bedroom suite and a Studio suite (family of 6). The rooms give a feeling of an old colonial club rather than a hotel and have a very nice ""old world"" feel to them. The staff and management are very helpful and courteous and make an effort to make you feel special. Even the GM and Dy GM both come out to talk to the guests every day at breakfast. The pools are not big but nice with direct sunset views and easy access to the beach. Breakfast is very good and is up to 11am which makes it very comfortable for late risers as well. The free poolside High Tea is also super.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Last point is the restaurant managed by a new French Chef. Amazing fusion food there.
Thank you again

357,A Jewel in the Crown,50,May 2019,"We had a two night stay and loved every minute of it. This is one grand hotel with incredible views out over the Indian Ocean. The room was huge and with free minibar and snacks. Wherever you are within the hotel grounds you are made to feel special and there is no shortage of very attentive staff on hand to make sure you are happy, relaxed and wanting for nothing. The staff really help make the experience with big smiles and friendliness that makes you feel very much at home. Both the GM and EAM met us during our stay either at breakfast or dinner which again added to the overall experience and leaving us very sad to leave. We can’t wait for our next stay and carry find memories of the time spent at The Legian so far.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

First of all, we get free minibar, free snacks, free in-room tea time, free in-room breakfast, and free toy for my 9-month-old baby niece. (Yeap, the resort treated my baby niece like a queen) Then, they serve you free bites and free cold water by the pool.

The attentiveness of the staff goes a long way. They are always there to serve and assist you. During my last day, I was not able to finish my breakfast because I was not feeling well. The staff (my bad I forgot her name) offer to make me chicken porridge. So sweet of her. Upon check out, we met some hiccup for our private transfer. The concierge staff just took full control of everything and solved our problem.

Thank you The Legian Seminyak. Well done on the turtle release program as well. We will definitely return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
359,Best Wedding Venue Ever,50,April 2019,"We decided to stay at The Legian Bali while looking for a suitable venue for my daughters wedding in Bali. I think the moment we stepped into the hotel, any venue we looked at would not compare to the beauty of this hotel! She instantly fell in love with The Legian as her destination wedding venue.

From the first meeting with Lady Gwenne (their wedding coordinator) right up until the wedding day was friendly, professional, prompt and on point. Trying to arrange a wedding from another country is always difficult, but with Lady’s efficient and professional manner, all was organized as discussed and more!

Photo’s do no justice as to how beautiful the wedding day turned out to be! It was simply spectacular!!! The food was absolutely delicious and the service we received was beyond what we expected!

We were spoiled from the day we arrived till the day we left! We were treated like royalty!

Thank you to Lady, Sunday, the management and all the wonderful and friendly staff at The Legian! You go above and beyond your calling! We will always hold fond and loving memories of one of the most special moments in our lives at The Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
360,Five Stars All The Way!!!,50,April 2019,"Stayed at the Legian for a week in late April 2019 with my wife and was blown away! The location, the surf, the grounds, all of the resort staff, and our suite was exceptional and made for a spectacular vacation! We have travelled to many beautiful destinations over the years and the Legian ranks up there in our top three for sure. And the massages at the spa were well worth the time and money spent, your massage therapists are among the best we've ever had. We would absolutely stay here if we get the opportunity to visit Bali again. Thanks for a great stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
361,"RETURNING ""HOME""",50,May 2019,"With views to the Indian Ocean; where the smallest suite is 75sqm and where you can lie in bed and ""listen to the music of the waves"" The Legian is a stunning resort property, located in Seminyak. The staff/team are what helps makes this property worth visiting over and over again - their personalized service and attention to detail is unsurpassed. The restaurant overlooks the 3 tiered pool and offers a terrific menu selection; whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The suites are large, all with lovely balconies to take in the view. The upper floors accessible by elevators. The GM and his team are really wonderful and dedicated to ensuring their guests are content and relaxed. Staying at The Legian is like returning to your own ""home"" - with all the extras! Thoroughly recommend!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
362,Bliss in Bali...,50,May 2019,"Everything that people have praised is true.
The location is stunning, the level of service from the well-trained staff is quite unbelievable, the dining is first class and the accommodation and housekeeping, superb. And of course this comes from the top, as in any business, and Hans Meier leads his team by example, constantly looking for ways to make his guests have the very best possible Legian experience.
My husband and I have mobility issues, which I informed the hotel of prior to our arrival, so we were thoughtfully given a ground floor room, with three steps to the lawn and very close to the dining and pool area. Alas the steps were just a touch too steep for us to negotiate with confidence, but we thanked reception for their effort. Within two hours of checking in, some plywood steps had been constructed to go over the existing ones, with a gentler tread height, and we were asked if we would like a handrail as well - and that, in a nutshell, is what the Legian is all about, making the guest as comfortable as is possible, to maximise their stay.
Although all the staff charmed us with their smiles and efficient outlook, special mention needs to be made of the delightful Assistant Manager, Anggan, with her warm personality that shone in every encounter we had with her, and also the caring Budi and Ari in the pool area, who made sure our frequent exits from the swimming pool happened without incident!
As others have remarked, The Legian is not just the best hotel in Bali, it has to rank as one of the finest hotels in the world, and we just loved every minute of our stay here. Well done, everyone, and thank you.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
363,Honeymoon Perfection!,50,May 2019,"We stayed for 4 nights (part of our Honeymoon) and wish we could have stayed much longer!

Thank you for the amazing time!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
364,Spa is something you can’t be missed,50,May 2019,"That is my 2nd time to stay at The Legian Bali. The hotel is still as good as 5 years ago and I think the services there are even better.

You can enjoy the great sunset at the pool and the spa is something you can’t be missed. I think pricing is also very reasonable. I have tried the Volcanic Hot Stone Massage (90mins) that is so good and the therapist use the hot stone to massage your body and the pain point which help me to sweep away all the pain on my neck, shoulder & waist.

Then the next morning I go and try the Foot massage plus Balinese Body massage. I enjoyed massage the bottom part of my feet and the therapist did a great job ...no matter pressure and acupoint are all good.

I will for sure go back again and hope to spend more nights there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
365,Relax and unwind at The Legian,50,May 2019,"The Legian is magic! I live in the region and just spent a long weekend at the hotel - my fourth visit in 12 months. Such a welcoming and professional team who CONSISTENTLY provide an excellent all-around experience. The team is always friendly but engaging just enough to make your stay feel personal without being intrusive. The rooms and grounds are fabulously maintained and are a peaceful oasis away from the busyness of Seminyak. Fantastically located, you can walk anywhere with easy access to the beach, cafes, restaurants and shops... and the grounds are large enough to easily spend the day relaxing by the pool or on your hotel balcony and yet, still feel private. And, my highlight this weekend, was being part of releasing some baby turtles into the ocean - such a brilliant experience and a great initiative on behalf of the hotel. Highly, highly recommend The Legian for a short or a longer stay. The hotel is a great base for sightseeing or just to laze the days away. Professional and warm service, great food, terrific location, and stunning experiences - everything you could hope for! Thank you everyone :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
366,Great Spot,50,May 2019,This hotel is right on the beach and amazing. We had a room that overlooked the beach where we could hear the waves at night. Thankyou to the team for being so welcoming and showing us the Bali Culture!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
367,Excellent location and lovely staff,50,May 2019,"This beautiful hotel is built to reflect the local style and using traditional materials. Our suite had gorgeous wooden floors yet with contemporary facilities. We had a wonderful bathroom with Aqua di Parma toiletries.
The balcony had a stunning view of the ocean.
The three pools are excellent with ocean views and great sun lounger decks. The two pool bars provide great service and the staff are so friendly and helpful.
It is only a short walk to the restaurants and bars of Seminyak - 5 minutes.
I can’t praise the staff enough they are all so helpful and welcoming.
We booked a car and driver for the day through the concierge and spent the day in Ubud and various temples and markets. This is well worth doing and the trips can be tailor made to suit the individual.
The only area of improvement I would suggest is the television which only provided quite limited viewing but as we were not in very much it didn’t detract from our enjoyment.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
368,Best hotel,50,May 2019,"It was the most beautiful hotel on Bali, great service, breakfast, rooms, pool. Speachless. I will go there again for sure. Rooms are very big, touch of Bali and very classy.
Service very very good, clean, everything perfect",The Legian Seminyak Bali
369,Superb. Beachfront Hotel,50,May 2019,My 2nd stay here in the last 6 months. Hard-to-beat beachfront location with excellent service and friendly staff. Spacious and luxurious rooms as well. Will definitely stay there again. Infinity pools with associated poolside bars make lounging a pleasure and one can watch the beach traffic from poolside whilst getting great service. A very unique property. Hans the General Manager and Alan the Resort Manager are both going the extra mile and are doing an brilliant job...,The Legian Seminyak Bali
370,Heaven on earth,50,May 2019,"This is by far one of the best hotels I've ever seen. Beautiful pool area with an really nice beach, good for swimming since there are almost no stones in the water. Amazing sunset views.
The staff in this hotel is outstanding. So friendly, pro-active and never too much, but always present if needed.
I want to highlight especially the pool butlers. Among all the great staff, they are really a gem of hospitality.
The rooms have beautiful style, as well as the entire hotel.
Check out the cool photographs in the lobby.
Nice breakfast buffet with even local food choices and high quality ingredients in all dishes.
Thank you so much for everything to the entire team.
We will be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
371,The best hotel I’ve ever visited,50,May 2019,"I really didn’t want to leave this resort and was so tempted to extend our day just a few more days longer. The Legian was our final stop in Bali and the leading hotels of the world Bali tour we did. We certainly saved the best until last. I literally cannot give one fault about this hotel.

- baggage taken to rooms
- we have a 1 bed delux suite and the room was massive
- mini bar stocked daily
- token chocolates or macaroons left on turn down service
- fresh water and cold towels at your bed by the pool.
-Perfect sunsets
- on the ocean , can get slightly noisy at night if you have an ocean facing room.
- the food omg was to die for it was delish. I became obsessed with the rosemary and garlic cracker breads.
- breakfast has plenty of options to choose from and catered for everyone.

I highly recommend this hotel and can not wait to return again in the future.

Amazing hotel and thank you for your hospitality whilst there",The Legian Seminyak Bali
372,The best hotel in Bali,50,May 2019,"We stayed in 4 different hotels during our romantic-couple trip to Bali and ended-up our stay in a Suite at The Legian Bali. This is from faraway the best hotel we’ve stayed in Bali (all hotels we stayed in were ranked from top hotels in Bali). I’m still wondering if this is not even the BEST hotel I’ve stayed in, in all my life. Communication by email was very efficient with the team in order to prepare our stay. Check-in was the smoothest check-in I’ve ever done, I was personally greeted by my name from the receptionist who managed our check-in and had our welcome drink while everything was getting done. At the same time the General Manager Alain came to greet us personally and thank us for choosing The Legian. When we got in the room, luggages were already in (it’s a really plus while in other hotels in Bali and across the world you have to wait some time to get your luggages), the room was personalized with a welcoming attention for our romantic stay and a letter from the management. Room is wonderful, spacious, fully equipped and very well furnished. All products for bathroom are from Acqua Di Parma brand! A real plus: Bose audio sound system with the speakers located everywhere in the room, and an iPod with wonderful musics in case your prefer not to connect your personal device. The minibar is complimentary, with a very interesting selection of articles and refilled every day. The daily evening turnaround is wonderful - the candles and the incense in the room are again a real plus. The location of hotel is just far enough from the crowd of Seminyak and just near enough to anywhere by walking distance. The butler are really helpful, they have advices us a wonderful place to have dinner - booked for us and provided a letter to the room in the afternoon with all useful information about our dinner outside. The infinity pools are wonderful - there are no much people at the pool and beach, you feel yourself very quiet and the personal is ultra helpful to anticipe all your need and make your stay memorable. They refill your water, clean up your towels, provide wet cold towels all day long. The complimentary daily afternoon tea can be served either at the beach, in the restaurant or in your room. The beach is very beautiful - no stones, only beautiful smooth sands. Breakfast is the best we had during our stay in Bali, very diverse selection and high quality of products (I particularly enjoyed the cold room for cheese...my French side!!). The spa is wonderful and ladies even offer to provide massages directly on the beach or next to the pool. Cherry on the cake: the hotel is located right heading west - you’ll enjoy the most beautiful sunset in Bali!!!!!! I highly highly highly recommend The Legian Bali - it really deserves it. And we will be back for sure!!!! Thank you to Alain the General Manager of the hotel for his personal attentions during all the stay and to all the team for making this stay memorable.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
373,Back again......definitely,50,May 2019,"You want to be treated like a celebrity? You want yummy food? You want excellent service? The Legian Bali is the place for that and more. This place has fantastic staff and is extremely well run, a credit to the management. All amenities are supplied and it within walking distance of the best restaurants in Seminyak.

I researched loads of hotels in the area and decided on the Legian as I felt it had the Bali experience with class and quality- I was not disappointed, it’s a really beautiful hotel with great staff and an upmarket feel about the whole property,
We had an wonderful birthday dinner on Saturday evening to celebrate my 50th birthday which was near the beach with our own chef and the whole experience was amazing , special thanks to Adi Sumartana our waiter who was professional and polite and explained each dish on our tasting menu extremely well , I had such a great evening to celebrate my birthday .

379,Fabulous hotel,50,April 2019,"This is a quite exceptional hotel. I travel a lot, and have stayed in many of the world's best hotels over the years, but cannot think of one materially better than this. The rooms are lovely, the setting and location perfect, but what is absolutely outstanding is the quality of the staff. Nearly half of them have been there since the day it opened its doors which is remarkable. If there are any bad reviews on this site (which I doubt), ignore them and do yourself a favour and go there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
380,The No.1 in Bali,50,March 2019,"Since many years we spent some time at the ""The Legian"" in Seminyak/Bali. It's simple to describe the Hotel, the Garden, the Management and the Personnel - extraordinär! We always feel like ""home"" at this place. You should have a sundowner at either the Ocean- or Poolbar and a light meal afterwards. Try Sashimi at this place!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
381,LOVED THE LEGIAN,50,December 2018,"This hotel is absolute luxury ! The attention to detail and the level of service is of a very high standard.

382,If You want luxury then dont waste any further time looking elsewhere,50,April 2019,"This property is all about ensuring your absolute satisfaction. The Legian Bali located in chic Seminyak is a true 5 star property with all the extras included as normal.

This was our 12 year and 13th stay and is is still the best Luxury resort Property in The World.

We stay @ The Cub Legion so if you want to step up to 6 star then let your head go a get yourself a Pool Villa. You still have 100% complete access to the Hotel facilities so you don't miss out on The Beach or the other excellent facilities the hotel offers.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
383,First time to Bali. Exceeded Expectations.,50,April 2019,"This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in. I had low expectations of what Bali may have to offer as a holiday destination but this hotel definitley changed my perception of this location. The service, ambience and food offered at The Legian is world class. I was after a pool side holiday to recharge the batteries and it delivered in spades. The location is also terrific with some of Bali's best restaurants close by, many in walking distance. The proximity to Bodyworks is also a plus given I there most days.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
384,"The Legian ""again""",50,April 2019,"Returned here for our third visit.
Really wonderful hotel. Rooms/suites are very spacious with a lovely views facing the ocean. Each room has a balcony or veranda. We always stay on the top floor.
As another reviewer mentioned, it is the little things that make the difference and the pool staff are always really helpful and look after you. Saying that all the staff without exception are so lovely and attentive. Although a long way to go from the UK,
we will be back again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
385,The Legian Hotel,50,April 2019,Wonderful property. Picturesque with marvelous staff and beautiful staff. Each room has an ocean view. The infinity pool is not to be missed. Exceptional and very detailed service. Intimate with cool vibe.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
386,It's the little touches,50,April 2019,"Amazing hotel right on the beach in Seminyak.Location is perfect for all the local shopping and restaurants. The three tiered pool has three depth levels which is wonderful for all different ages and types of travellers- couples and families. It's all the little touches that make this property a stand out from the others. They are too numerous to mentioned but a few are being greeted by name , pool towels straightened when you go for a swim , little treats when you are sitting by the pool and left daily in your room. One bedroom suites are very large. Pool staff were fantastic and anticipated your needs ( special mention to Budi who looked after us every day ). The staff are the best asset to this hotel. Thank you for a wonderful week.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
387,Wonderful,50,April 2019,"This is simply put a great hotel especially if you have children.
It has one of the best pools I have seen anywhere with three pools which cascade into each other facing the ocean.
The rooms was beautiful. Food is good.
It’s elegant and relaxed at the same time, ensuring a wonderful time is shared by all",The Legian Seminyak Bali
388,Great Property,50,April 2019,Attention to detail was amazing. Even the basic suites are phenomenal. The staff is truly worthy of a luxury hotel. Only found one fault and that was that the tiles in the pool were slippery. Other than that we would recommend this property to anybody wanting the best.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
389,Only for a drink but wish we had stayed there.,50,April 2019,"Popped in for a drink at the bar overlooking the beach. Was blown away by how beautiful this hotel was. The staff were very attentive, a women even got my bag a chair :-), it was lovely sipping a cappuccino watching the sunset over the beach. I was rather jealous of all the guests staying there and even considered checking in for the night. If we ever come back to Bali, I will be staying here!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
390,Perfection. Would stay again and again.,50,March 2019,"The Legian completely blew me away. It’s the best service I’ve ever experienced and I have stayed in my fair share of luxury accommodation. The service quality was truly exceptional and consistent throughout our entire stay. I could feel the sincerity of the staff and it felt like they genuinely wanted me to enjoy my stay. Little things like remembering our names, proactively shifting our pool umbrellas when it got sunny, constantly refilling our glasses of water by the pool. Everything was done with a smile like it was no trouble at all. The list goes on and on.
We spent most of our days by the pool and were always fed very well by The Legian. There was free sorbet, juices, and afternoon tea. The minibar in the room was free of charge too, which was a nice touch. The property itself is beautifully maintained and you can’t go wrong with any of the rooms! And that 3 tiered infinity pool overlooking the beach is just stunning! We didn’t want to go any where else. I’m completely in awe of this hotel and will not stay anywhere else when I return to Seminyak!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
391,Found it!,50,March 2019,"Second time we have stayed at the Legian and it won’t be the last. Great location, beautiful hotel, stunning rooms, delicious food, amazing staff and the sunsets, the sunsets are stunning!

This hotel has something about it that enables you to completely relax from the moment you are met by the smiling faces of the team on arrival at the airport. The welcoming experience doesn’t stop as the staff can’t do enough to make your stay special.

Don’t forget a visit to the Spa to compliment the whole relaxing experience, it’s wonderful.

I can’t complement enough and we will be back very soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

394,Saved our honeymoon,50,March 2019,"If i could give this hotel 10 stars i would. We stayed four nights and had an unbelievable stay. The food, the people, the views, the location are all absolutely amazing. We checked out to go to the hanging gardens in Ubud. HG was supposed to be a world renowned 5 star hotel but it wasn’t one star compared to the Legian. We returned after 5 hours of travel to a smiling friendly staff. They accommodated is with a great room even though the hotel was at capacity. I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel and the hotel itself. They made our honeymoon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
395,Best luxury hotel in the world,50,March 2019,"Always such a pleasure to stay at the Legian. One week feels like two. I come back to work so relaxed. I love the pool overlooking the beach. People walking by with their dogs, horse riders through the surf. Great afternoon tea provided, I love the ginger tea with little cakes. Excellent breakfast. New this trip was a cold room for cheese. And they have Pilates and Spinning classes added to yoga now. I felt very cared for in the Pilates class. A new chef is on the way so the menu will change. But it’s the timeless effort all staff make to welcome you. There is a standard of care here that is second to none. See you next year.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
396,Easily the Best in Bali,50,February 2019,"we are regular visitors to Bali for work and play. the Legian is our home away from home.

397,Service extraordinaire!,50,March 2019,"Our stay at The Legian Bali did not disappoint! From the moment you check in until the moment you check out you will feel pampered and loved beyond anything ever experienced! We brought our two daughters, 24 and 19 and stayed in the 2 bedroom suite. We were only able to stay for two nights but would recommend staying longer to truly have to time to unwind and absorb the amazing hotel amenities and service available. LOVE this property!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
398,"Service,Service, Service",50,March 2019,"I have stayed at The Legian a number of times but not for a few years. I first visited it shortly after it opened in 1997. Returning I was so pleased to see the same quality of service still in place. The staff are so attentive, yet unnoticeable. Example: relaxing at the pool you suddenly find a glass of chilled water and chilled face spray with a cold towel beside you. Throughout the day staff come past offering chilled fruit or a delicious yoghurt sorbet.
I love the rooms, so spacious with the high ceilings, huge bathroom and comfy lounge.
As always the food is excellent with staff so obliging.

Highly recommend for those looking for a quiet, relaxing retreat on the beach, yet in the heart of Seminyak and all the great eating areas.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
399,Allways the best - exceeded our expectations yet again!!,50,March 2019,"We visit Bali often and ocassionaly try other properties but always end up back at The Legian. It’s like a second home. This is a sophisticated property and one not to be missed.
The staff are just awesome, nothing is to difficult and they all remember you and address you by your name. The management are constantly ensuring everything is running perfectly and know local Bali well so always good for tips on the latest restaurants in the area.

The staff are world class with their attention to detail, professionalism and friendliness. The COO Hans is a gentleman who has created an remarkable culture. The Legian makes you feel like returning family, and they go out of their way to make you feel special.

Thank you Hans - we look forward to our next visit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

408,The Legian Bali,50,March 2019,Amazing hotel and staff. Nothing was too much of an ask. The staff went out of their way to look after us. The food was great and so was our room. The location is great too. Close to Seminyak village and lots of cafes and shopping. Just perfect. The best hotel we have ever stayed at. Will definitely come back.,The Legian Seminyak Bali

410,Serious warning,50,March 2019,"If you like noise, don’t book this hotel
If you like small, ugly and dirty rooms, don’t book this hotel
If you like unfriendly staff, don’t book this hotel
If you like bad food, don’t book this hotel
If you want to feel unwelcome as a guest, don’t book this hotel
If you like that visitors are allowed to use facilities in your hotel, don’t book this hotel
And most important: if you are looking for reasons to complain stay away as far as you can",The Legian Seminyak Bali
411,Only one complaint...,50,February 2019,"Mind blowing. My wife and I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world including many of the leading brands. The Legian blows them all away.

It’s all in the details and the lack of any inconvenience. For example before you even think about it yourself a daybed is prepared for you with clean comfortable towels, ice water (refilled during the day) and a parasol that protects you against the Bali sun. They even move that parasol pro actively.

The way they provide these services is impressive because it’s never intruding or too much. That’s all thanks to the staff, very professional but genuinely friendly and welcoming at the same time. They really seem to be aware of your personal preferences.

This trend continues with the food. During previous Bali trips we usually had dinner outside the hotel, but in The Legian we felt there was no need for that. It’s very difficult to get a higher quality outside of the hotel. This is worthy of a Michelin Star. For my wife they prepared local Balinese dishes, even tastier than in the local warungs. This was all outside the menu and every day they suggested something different.

The style of the building and rooms is monumental, it’s not modern or new but extremely well maintained and it has a special feel to it. It looks beautiful like the local temples. Rooms are luxurious and comfortable. The pool area is spacious with three large infinity pools and all guests have good privacy and facilities nearby. There are not many rooms and all have sea view, so I can’t imagine it ever feels crowded.

After you’ve walked through the impressive entrance of The Legian you immediately forget that it’s located in the middle of busy Seminyak. Even the beach in front of the hotel is the nicest part of the strip.

We will definitely return to The Legian and we have just one complaint... time flies when everything is so good.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
412,Great family holiday,50,February 2019,This is our 4th time staying at The Legian and we had a wonderful stay. The room that we got was in the perfect location for our children as it was close to the pool and restaurant. From when we arrived we felt welcome with everyone knowing our names and our children's names. The staff were very attentive and could not have looked after us more. Every time we asked for things they came very quickly. We were told that we would have to pay for our children's breakfast but it was all included each day and there was no extra cost. breakfast was wonderful - we just wish we could have enjoyed it for longer each day. The invitation to have cocktails and canapes was lovely and we got to view the Beach House which was very impressive. I could not fault this hotel and we will definitely be back.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
413,Recharge and relax!,50,February 2019,"This was not our first time in Bali but certainly our first time in Seminyak. If you are staying here, The Legian is hands down the best resort in the area. It is a classic luxury Balinese beach resort. The food was amazing and the accomodations more than comfortable. The service cannot be faulted. People who work here make it their job to make sure that you have everything you could possibly need. We were a family of 5 (with teens) and the two bedroom suite was very spacious for all of us. We were well fed throughout the day, from breakfast, snacks by the pool and afternoon tea. They have gluten free options for those who need it. If you want to eat ""clean"", the will accomodate that as well. The spa was heavenly. We normally stay at resorts such as this, with great spa facilities, but I must say the massage I had was the best I have ever had. Bonus: daily yoga, Pliates and spin classes. Forget the beach clubs like Ku De Ta and Mr Potatohead! This is the place to have sunset drinks! Thank you The Legian staff and management for a wonderful stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
414,Best Location and service,50,February 2019,"Everything at The Legian in Seminyak is exceptional, from the location (the best on the beach of Seminyak), to the food, to the service (their staff is the nicest and most friendly) and to the attention they put in every detail to make sure that you have the best experience possible on the island. I will surely go back to The Legian and I hope it will happen very soon because I’m already missing it! Highly recommended if you’re looking for peace, tranquility, beautiful interiors, first-class service in a warm and cozy ambience! Thank you for the amazing stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
415,Magnificent,50,February 2019,"We stayed for two nights after a 14 day cruise. We were concerned that standards may drop on land but if anything they went even higher at The Legian.
The location is very good, beachfront with the bustle of Seminyak only a 100 yards away and the grounds and pool area are very secluded and superbly maintained. It is an extremely tranquil place.
Our suite was also excellent but the service received from every single member of staff we encountered was exceptional and this aspect really stood out. The Legian is a luxury resort in every sense of the word and we would return without hesitation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
416,Sunset birthday celebration,40,February 2019,"We went to the bar for drinks and to watch the sunset, we were not disappointed. It was beautiful! Everything was prefect and peaceful. The reason I gave 4 stars is only because we were served by a trainee and he told us cocktails were buy1 get1 free but later we found out it was actually buy2 get1 free. For a resort like this that should not be an error.
After we complained the manager gave us a free cocktail which was a sign of good management",The Legian Seminyak Bali
417,I’m in awe..... ♥️,50,February 2019,"Not sure where to begin...

Everything, seriously, literally everything about this hotel is just beyond amazing.
I cannot think of a single thing I didn’t like or that needs improvement.
Yes. It is THAT perfect.

The staff is so service minded, friendly and attentive in every way, always looking out for your needs and always one step ahead.

The food and drinks are delicious, rooms are sublime and the bed is amazing.
The pools are great and you are right at the beach enjoying the breeze.
The location of the hotel is also great, you can walk to other restaurants and shops easily.

All I can say is that I cannot wait to come back!

Terima kasih for everything!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
418,Amazing Stay at The Legian,50,February 2019,"We stayed at The Legian, in one bedroom suite. This was most luxurious room i have ever stayed. It had everything from bar accessories to luxury bath amenities. From the start to last minute of our stay every staff member had smile on their face and happy to serve us beyond their capacity. Location wise it is perfect 5-10 mins walk to every good place like seminyak square, motel mexicola, potato head and Ku te da. A must stay if you have budget, but paying for absolute luxury and excellent service is never bad.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
419,Great Experience,50,February 2019,Our stay at The Legian Bali was made a very personal experience by the staff. Our room was spacious and luxurious with fresh flowers and a soothing sound track when we chose. Housekeeping and other staff were very efficient and helpful.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
420,Beautiful Hotel and Excellent Service,50,February 2019,This is the second time we came back to the Legian. The service and professionalism of the staff is exceptional. We have a wonderful few days in the hotel. The hotel is fronting the beautiful stretch of the Seminyak beach. The location of the hotel is also very good. It is within walking distance to a lot of good restaurants and shoppings.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
421,Perrrfect stay,50,February 2019,"Everything was great. Very attentive service. Our butler , Arisna did his perfect job. Hope to see him next year. Food was also great. All pools (the main, the villa one, and one in our villa) were beautiful and have own character. Whenever we go to Bali, the Legian will be our first choice.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
422,The Best of Bali,50,February 2019,"Next time you want Bali with the very best service, food, location and amenities - Think no further than the Legian in Seminyak. We had the most woderful time and the staff were amazing!!! A must stay!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
423,Family Vacation,50,February 2019,"Very nice place hotel in bali with family, always choose this hotel to stay everytime we go to Bali. The front desk staff ( TIUR ) very nice and helpful to let us stay with free upgrade room. Very recommended place",The Legian Seminyak Bali
424,FANTASTIC!!!,50,January 2019,"I stayed at The Legian for two nights and it was WONDERFUL. The service is second to none. Everything was just perfect and more. I missed my booking by one day and checked in on the wrong dates, but they still fixed it up for me and gave me an extra day for the day I missed without any extra charge. I would say this is the best hotel I have stayed at while in Seminyak and Kuta areas. Everything was just perfect, the location, the beach, the room, the service, and the experience. I would definitely go there again when I visit Bali again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
425,The Legian - 10/10,50,February 2019,"I absolutely loved The Legian. It is such a beautiful Hotel that has been designed for pure luxury. The infinity pool overlooking the ocean is breathtaking, the food is A1 and the rooms are beautiful.
Staff are warm and welcoming. I will be back for sure.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
426,great but souless,30,December 2018,"its a great location, food is great, everything is great... but I just find it all a little bit robotic with not much spontaneity. Will return for the view and the tasting menu. Always a nice time here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
427,Pool with a view,40,January 2019,"Travelled to Bali in January 2019 and spent the second half of the trip at The Legian Hotel. A 5 Star luxury hotel located right on Seminyak beach.

I’ve rated the hotel a 4 out of 5 for our experience.

The positives; the pool and view is spectacular. Service is really good especially the kitchen and service staff who were very friendly and attentive. Food was also good however on the expensive side as expected given it is a luxury hotel.

Location is also very close to Seminyak village and lots of good restaurants and shopping. Breakfast and afternoon tea good and the ability to have it in your room was a nice option.

There were some other nice touches in the hotel, such as service at the pool, ice cream provided at the pool, all staff speak very good English and the exclusivity of the hotel (people weren’t allowed to walk into hotel grounds from the beach) but for a 5 Star luxury hotel and the price per room (approximately US$520 per night) I was left a little disappointed with aspects of the room. Mini bar refill is included in the price of the room but the selection is limited to juice, soft drink and water with alcohol limited to only 2 Bintang beers in the fridge so it hardly makes the incentive a bonus for your stay.

Compared to other 5 star hotels, opportunities for this hotel would also be to provide a better range of toiletries and replace them daily which other luxury hotels do (hand soap wasn’t replaced daily). Perhaps improve the reading lamps (which looked like a cheap version of what you’d expect at a Novotel).

All in all a good experience but essentially you are paying for the location, exclusivity and the view.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
428,Wonderful stay in an amazing hotel,50,January 2019,"Just returned from an amazing time in this hotel. the staff were amazing, and the facilties were perfect. I cannot recommend the hotel enough. Every aspect of the hotel was wonderful. we shall certainly be going back as soon as we can.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
429,The perfect gateway.,50,January 2019,"If you are looking for the perfect weekend relaxing time, our even for a week holidays, this is just the best hotel on Semayak, we found all the services, food over the top! For sure will be our number one destination for a little space from the big concrete jungle.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
430,Thoroughly enjoyed - service and ambiance outstanding,50,January 2019,"We came for a weekend on recommendation of friends. Throughly enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel. Service was perfectly attentive, never intrusive. I can understand why people return and return again. The room was beautiful and the food excellent. Lots of little free services like free minibar. Fresh fruit in the room. Afternoon tea available over looking the sea or from the privacy of your room. Your choice. The sounds of the waves wash away any worries. The comfort and beauty of the room, the best we experienced in a few luxury locations on Bali and rivals the best rooms we have stayed anywhere world wide. Loved it. Really loved it. Thank you for making my birthday one to remember.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
431,End of Asia Tour,50,January 2019,"This resort is beyond spectacular! Not only are the rooms beautifully decorated suites with views of the Indian Ocean, the staff are all perfect host. They are attentive, pleasant and eager to make you feel pampered. We will certainly be back. Thank you Alan and the entire Legian team.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
432,As close to perfect as I've ever experienced.,50,April 2018,"This review is woefully overdue, but better late than never! My husband and I spent four blissful nights at the Legian last April and our experience was nothing short of perfect.

The Legian is not a trendy, overdone Instagram hotel. Rather, this hotel exudes understated class and timeless elegance. The open air lobby is gorgeously decorated in rich dark wood and an array of local art. Check-in was efficient and comfortable. You will never encounter a face that isn't smiling.

The rooms, all of which have an ocean view, are spotlessly clean and nicely appointed. The bathrooms are spacious and the provided toiletries smell lovely. The terrace was the perfect place for a pre-dinner glass of prosecco. The provided snacks were very appreciated on a couple of late-night-munchies occasions.

The Legian shines the most when it comes to service, though. For example, I'm fair skinned and not much of a sun worshipper, so I sought out shade by the pool every day. As the sun moved throughout the afternoon, the very kind pool attendants would adjust my umbrella, or even bring over extras, to ensure I was shaded all day. I never asked for this - it just was done for me. The servers in the pool and beach area were also very accommodating. Everyone was happy to help, and eager to hear how our stay was going.

The included breakfast was fabulous. There is a lovely continental buffet, and also an a-la-carte menu, both of which offer tons of options.

The infinity pool was gorgeous, perfectly heated, and impeccably clean at all times. The beach was also scrupulously maintained throughout the day and cleared of seaweed & debris.

I would not stay anywhere else if I were to return to Seminyak!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
433,Seamless visit,40,January 2019,"It has been quite some years since I stayed at the Legian, was pleased to return and find the hotel has retained those original features in terms of design and detail which had first attracted me. I have been a long time admirer of the work of the late designer Jaya Ibrahim who did the interiors of the hotel.

I found the staff to be very engaging in a very natural manner, very un obtrusive, anticipating well needs.

A small note, I unfortunately lost my room key, was informed at the desk that there would a be a USD 50 charge for a replacement key. This request was eventually waived, I would suggest that upon checking-in, or posted at the desk, there should a notice pre-informing of this potential charge.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
434,Outstanding!!,50,January 2019,"Just spent a fabulous 9 nights at this wonderful beach front haven, following an exhaustive tour of Vietnam.

From the moment you arrive you are made to feel so welcome and special, the suites are extremely comfortable and clean with all the amenities that you could ask for and more, it is just like home away from home. The restaurant and pool bars cater for all needs and nothing is too much trouble.

As regards the staff they are a credit to the management of the hotel as each and every one of them are just outstanding, they are extremely attentive without being intrusive.

We have been fortunate enough to have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and in our opinion this is up there with them all and we would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to the most discerning traveler as THE only place to stay when in Bali.

Thank you to each and every member of staff for a great stay and we look forward to being back in the not too distant future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
435,Honeymoon at The Club villas,50,January 2019,"We recently stayed in Villa 5 at the Club Legian for our honeymoon. From the moment we arrived the service was second to none. We were collected at the airport by our butler Sande. He took care of us all week, between lifts wherever we wanted, dinner reservations, delivering our daily a la carte breakfasts ( great selection and really tasty) to our room, afternoon tea and cocktail hour.
There is so much included when you book a villa at the Legian. You can enjoy all the facilities at the main hotel across the road (great gym, yoga, pools, restaurants) and you are treated like royalty wherever you go. The staff across all the properties are so friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable.
The villas are amazing with numerous outdoor seating areas, large heated pool, outdoor bath, very comfortable bed and a huge bathroom, not to mention the mini bar that is also included.
The beach front location of the main pool is a great area to enjoy cocktails at sunset.
The location of the hotel is really close to Seminyak square (via a shortcut next to the hotel), other great restaurants and bars like La Lucciola, Bikini, Motel Mexicola.
We also had a meal at the restaurant on the last night and it was beautifully prepared and presented.
The Legian is definitely a great choice for a honeymoon or special occasion.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
436,Classic Luxury!,50,December 2018,"There are many hotel options available in Seminyak but Legian will always be my preferred choice.

From the generous Suites size to attentive service rendered, it’s hard to go anywhere else! The entry category is the Studio Suite, starting at a spacious size of approx 100sqm!

While I had stayed there before, my favourite and personal recommendation will always be the One Bedroom Deluxe Suite. Standing at 110sqm, I love the layout better as it reminds me of a home away from home.

Minibar is all-inclusive and all suites are ocean-facing. Can’t imagine any other (better) way to view the sunset!

The Restaurant’s service is remarkably subtle yet attentive. Go there for your first breakfast and they already know who you are!

The club villa are beautiful and private - I find them great for non-beach lovers, or anyone who prefer less interaction for their holidays!

For families and/or group of close friends, go for the Beach House and you can thank me later.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
437,Thank You for welcoming us into your home!,50,January 2019,"Management and staff are fantastic. Management and exceptional leadership from the top down works! Our family was warmly greeted by name by Made who seamlessly transitioned us from our car to paradise upon arrival. Throughout our entire stay we were greeted by name by all personnel from Dedy in the restaurant, to housekeeping, pool personnel, bartenders, to Hans, the manager, who stopped by our breakfast every morning to inquire about our previous day and to see what he could do to ensure we enjoyed an exceptional day.

When the aforementioned is added to a state-of-the-art, top quality facility in a top beach-front location on one of Bali's best beaches, the result is awesome. I am pleased to unreservedly recommend the Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
438,Mind blowing fabulous,50,January 2019,"I am in love with this place for so many reason! Staff 10 out of 10! Atomostphere and location world class! Style elegance charm, sunset where you feel you died and went to heaven😄❤️ A must for people who love to be IMPRESSED event 2 mins!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
439,Exceptional !!!!,50,January 2019,"We have just stayed with our young children for eight nights, in a club villa. Our third visit in three years.

The club staff have been superb!!! Absolutely faultless service. Brilliant with our children too. The Spa and thermal suites are a haven of tranquility and maintained to a very high standard.

A special mention must go to Merta who was our Butler for our stay. He is amazing.
The kids club staff were also great.

We found the new Management team led by Hans to be exceptional. Every morning the managers came and spoke to all guests. Knowing all the customers, listening and caring. Customer care at its finest. Best management we have experienced! At last a hotel that feels like home due to the personal touch!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
440,Club Villa Experience,50,June 2018,We stayed at the Legian in the club villas in June 2018 and this would have to be one of the most fantastic experiences we have had at any hotel in Bali. The villas are excellent and the butler service is second to none. Club experience is exclusive. Great location. This review has been written late but needed to be posted due to how fantastic this hotel experience was.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
441,Legion Visit,50,November 2018,Legion Hotel weekend away. View from suite and walk on the private beach during the morning. will worth a visit though price range is at the upper end of what should be expected even for a 5 star hotel,The Legian Seminyak Bali
442,Modern but old world class,50,December 2018,"Wonderful and decompressing stay at the Legian. The staff are gracious, funny and engaged without being intrusive. Amenities, suites, infinity pool are gorgeous but the style is so Balinese you know exactly where you are ... not some groovy boutique hotel that could be anywhere.

Was last there 3 years ago and nothing tired about the place. It was as wonderful as last time.

One of the best located beach bars in this stretch and food and drinks well done. Some very fun cocktails.

And the spa. To hear the ocean breaking as you are whisked into bliss by strong hands ... sigh. The spa team are really a class act.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
443,Memorable stay!,50,December 2018,The staff at the Legian is really attentive. The food is good and we really love the pool by the beach. We have the best sunset..and all the rooms are facing the the sea with the view of sunset. We will definitely go back again!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
444,Pure paradise,50,May 2018,"I’ve been meaning to write a review for the Legian ever since I returned home. This is my first review I’ve ever left and I think it says a lot about the impression this place made on me that i still feel inclined to write it now 6 months after I left. I stayed In a villa with my partner and we had personal butler service from Agus. I have thought hard about this, and I genuinely can not find fault in anything we had, nothing in fact was even below excellent. It was actually staying in another 5 star place recently that compelled me to leave this review now so long after we left as the legion was a league above. The legian was five star plus, it’s lots of small touches that elevated the place above others and the consistent high quality and delivery of everything. An amazing location, amazing personal and friendly service without being too over the top (which I don’t like). Use of a car to visit the many excellent restaurants so always felt a bit like a VIP arriving in a nice air conditioned 4x4 with air con. Do not hesitate to book here, it is worth the money for sure. Only problem is that any place you visit after will struggle to match up. Will have to go back one day, shame it’s so far from the UK. Thanks to Agus and Alain who were both very personable and knowledgeable about the area and hotel and helped make this holiday truly memorable. Am potentially moving to the Middle East next year so will be a bit closer, so can hopefully make a return trip.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
445,Relaxing Break for Couples,50,April 2018,"The Legian is the best of Balinese hospitality. The staff was gracious and warm. The resort has a pool close to the beach while the beach is maintained and kept clean (as can be). The food was delicious and there is a wide array of options, from local to more western. This was a romantic getaway from us and we also enjoyed daily yoga and the spa.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
446,Simply amazing,50,November 2018,"We’ve just returned from the most incredible stay at The Legian Hotel, it was very difficult to leave and wish we could stay forever!

Everything about our stay was simply perfect. The team here at this hotel were by far the most helpful and friendliest team we’ve ever had the pleasure of staying with.
We were travelling with a 7 month old baby and everyone ensured our needs (and my baby’s needs) were met. From the guys working by the pool who would ensure we had enough shade from the sun for my baby to the team at breakfast who made sure my son had a high chair and even provided a bib too, everyone was very helpful and made our stay extremely enjoyable.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which perfect for 4 adults and a baby. We had a beautiful balcony overlooking the gardens and beach.

The location of this hotel is as good as it gets in Seminyak. It’s on a slightly busy road but as soon as you step inside the hotel grounds you are in a perfect oasis of calm and serenity. This hotel also has undoubtedly the best view for those Balinese sunsets. We always made sure we had a sunbed on the front at 5pm with a cocktail in hand to watch this amazing natural wonder.

We couldn’t recommend this hotel highly enough. If you are looking for the perfect place to stay in Seminyak this is head and shoulders above the rest!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
447,One of the leading hotels in the world indeed,50,December 2018,"The location is one of the best In seminyak, having a beautiful beach and next to an area with shops and cafes. Excellent service, staff have a great attitude and knowledgeable , management presence ensures you are having a great stay, all attentive, warm and pleasant. One of my favorite hotels having traveled extensively.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
448,Understated Luxury,50,December 2018,"Just back from a four night stay at The Legian. If you look for an oasis of understated luxury in the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, look no further, this is it. Wonderful location, great suites, perfect service, attention to detail, lovely food, a beautiful spa area, well-equipped gym, etc., etc., .
Big thanks to the whole team at The Legian, I came as a stranger and left feeling like family...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
449,"Relaxing stay, flawless service",50,November 2018,"Stayed here with my partner for a quick getaway in November. It was my first time and his second at the Legian. I have to say the service was absolutely flawless, and the quality of food was amazing as well.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was very well appointed and had an ocean view.

The newly refurbished spa and gym areas are fantastic and one of the highlights of the hotel along with the restaurant. While there are plenty of fantastic restaurants in Seminyak the restaurant at the Legian was definitely our most memorable meal of the trip.

Would recommend to anyone heading to Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
450,Luxury & Location,50,November 2018,The Legian is located in a brilliant position on the beach. The accommodation is very luxurious. I stayed in a one bedroom deluxe ocean suite. It is very large and offers a complimentary mini bar too. The views are stunning and the day bed on the balcony is great if you don’t feel like being in the sun at the pool. You can sip on your champagne on your balcony! The service is fantastic and the breakfast buffet offers many options. It’s my 2nd time here and I’ll definitely be back. Thanks for another fabulous stay.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
451,Relaxed,50,November 2018,"Thank you to ‘the Legian’ hotel, Bali. Such a relaxed comfortable and happy stay, the room was clean, comfortable and spacious and with the lovely wide balcony we were able to breakfast outside. Staff were amazing making us all feel so welcome. All in all a wonderful place to stay",The Legian Seminyak Bali
452,JUST DO IT,50,October 2018,"Book a Room Pack and Go. A really special experience. Stayed 11 days OCT/NOV with my 2 sisters.
Have stayed several times before and can’t believe I did not come back sooner. Nowhere else is as good
The STAFF look after you like a dream. They are fantastic.
POSITION. Perfect. Choose a different restaurant each night. They are all close by.
Shopping, Massages and the Body workshop all a short distance.
HOWEVER THE LEGIAN facilities are sooo good you don’t want to walk anywhere.
Breakfast is super. OMG you must have the French toast. Then jump in the pool and try and swim it off!,,,
Truly a fabulous Hotel. We all think the BEST and thank you to everyone who made this holiday so special",The Legian Seminyak Bali

454,Amazing Stay - Bali Elegance!,50,November 2018,"Just completed a two night stay at The Legian and loved every minute. Our one bedroom deluxe suite was enormous: living room, dining room, entry hall with adjacent powder room on one side and bar area on the other, dual bathroom vanities, separate rain shower and bathtub, and a large two-sided ocean front balcony. Very comfortable and elegant furnished., beautiful fresh flowers, relaxing music via the iPod and Bose stereo system. Exquisite bed, pillows and linens. Room attendants provided service throughout the day.

Complimentary mini-bar with soft drinks, waters, juices, beer, chocolate, cookies, fruit bowl, snacks, nespresso, tea. Minibar was replenished daily. Wonderful Acqua di Parma toiletries in the bathroom.

Incredibly attentive pool staff without being intrusive. The staff constantly were refreshing water and cool towels. They would serve complementary sorbet at your chair by the pool.

Breakfast each morning was delicious with an amazing variety of foods via the menu or buffet. The gamelan performance each morning as you entered breakfast really added to the Bali spirit. Wait staff in the restaurant anticipated many of our requests. It was great to see so many long term employees, you can feel just how much they genuinely care about their guests. Throughout the hotel we were constantly referred to by name!!

Dinner one night at The Restaurant was suburb! Beautiful atmosphere on the outside patio with the fire pits, moonlight and crashing ocean. There were two pool cafes/bars with nice selection of drinks and lunch/snacks.

Alain, the resort manager would talk with each guest during breakfast. He was personally very warm and concerned about his guests

Excellent and friendly security at the gates and on the beach.
Reception staff were personable and professional, our send away was fabulous!

The resort is very quiet and elegant with peaceful surroundings, but just steps to the beach. Beautiful three level infinity pool. Easy walk to popular beach front bars and restaurants. Participated in yoga each morning on the beautiful lawn overlooking the beach. Reflexology foot massage overlooking beach was delightful.

We had an evening flight so we were able to enjoy the hotel for the entirety of our last day. Unfortunately our stay was for only two nights, next time will have to be longer. In the age of boring cookie cutter design hotels (which have no feel of the destination you are traveling to), The Legian provides an elegant slice of Bali and her charms.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

456,Incredible stay!,50,September 2018,"I had an incredible stay at the Legian! This was my first trip to Bali, and this is the only place I would recommend you stay in the Seminyak area. The rooms are so spacious, and it's in the best location - you can walk to great shopping and dining or you are just a short cab ride away. I love the zen vibe, it's so relaxing! The staff is also amazing, they even called my by my name (how do they do it?!) which felt very personalized. I really have zero complains, I would highly recommend you stay here! I will definitely be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
457,We’ll be back!!!,50,October 2018,"Since 1996 we have enjoyed staying at The Legian as it represents a “rest and recover” holiday destination for us. Due to unforseable circumstances we were unable to visit over the past 6 years and we’re delighted to return this October for 2 weeks. Exhausted, we we’re delivered to this oasis by The Legians private airconditioned vehicle only to be greeted on arrival by General Manager Hans Jorg Meier with a genuine warmth, which set the tone for the duration of our stay. The Hotel and it’s grounds are magnificent and well maintained, the staff are friendly and professional, the food world class and the attention to detail is faultless. We can’t wait to return!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
458,Best Honeymoon hotel destination in Bali,50,November 2018,"My partner and I recently got married in Sydney and booked a quick honeymoon to Bali with our first stop being The Legian. This isn’t our first trip and we know Bali quite well. Wow wow wow the service was out of this world. From the airport pick up to the greeting at the hotel lobby it was outstanding.
We had book a suite with amazing sweeping beaches views, we had a 3rd floor room and it was huge and we’ll appointed.
The breakfast was 10/10 with a huge selection of local and international foods once again the staff couldn’t be more helpful.
We basically sat by the pool for 4 days to recover post wedding, up to 9 hours by the pool, amazing service with 3 great infinity pools to choose from. You get complimentary towels, water, cold hand towel and more. Throughout the day little treat keep coming by. Sorbets cold fruit punch etc

If you want a great place to stay which is centrally located with five star service then this is the place",The Legian Seminyak Bali
459,Details mattered!,50,October 2018,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights as our first stop of our honeymoon last week and it was amazing! We honestly couldn’t stop taking about how incredible this stay was and it’s all because of the staff’s attention to detail. They immediately greeted us by name and offered us a delicious welcome drink that was much needed after a long flight from NYC. We were taken aback by our one bedroom suite that had a killer ocean view. The soothing music playing out of provided iPod and Bose surround sound made for a calm stay! The hotel pools and deck were very well maintained and quiet. So much of Bali can be loud and busy but the Legian was very soothing at all times. We used their great gym daily and had two yoga sessions with two fantastic instructions. We were soo impressed by the staffs genuine kind nature and willing to go the extra mile. The entire hotel from the food, the rooms and fantastic staff made our stay unforgettable. We will be back and I’d highly recommend staying at this special hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
460,At Bertram's Hotel but much better,50,October 2018,"Fans of classics should remember At Bertram's Hotel very well: Christie describes there an amazing ""time-capsule"" that has survived over the decades without losing anything of its opening charms only to succumb to the criminal temptation and perish. There is no danger of such an unfortunate end to the glorious history here: expert management that has the sole target of professional excellence guarantees that At The Legian's shall and will never end at all. Over the years, I've exhausted the superlatives while describing The Legian. This is a truly unique place, and its main achievement is exactly this: while everything ages and the fresh and glossy places become somewhat tired and complacent over the time, The Legian proves that this development is not at all inevitable. There is nothing tired about this place and it is as vibrant and aspiring for excellence now as it was a quarter of a century ago when it had been opened. It requires a particular type of management to achieve that: strategic vision, sober assessment of the market and its trends should complement decades of in-depth managerial success at both site- and group-level in order to bring the result. Hans Joerg Meier personifies these qualities and, as a GM and COO, is one of the very few professionals who could actually deliver it at the required level.

For many years now, I've been a regular guest at The Legian, and, surprisingly to myself, I have developed a particular attachment to this place, taking everything that happens over there very personally. When I was checking out last week, I was leaving my favourite hotel with the usual sadness that inevitably, every holiday comes to an end, but with the pride and joy that I haven't experienced for some years now: I am confident that it is not just in good hands now but in the best possible ones, and this is the very least that this amazing place and the amazing team that work there deserve. I checked out only last week but I already look forward to enjoying their hospitality and genuine family welcome again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
461,Attention to detail....,50,October 2018,"The Legian is all about attention to detail. Fullstop. From the moment you are greeted by name at the airport to the farewell in the lobby it’s apparent that your every need is anticipated. Beautifully appointed suites (it is an all suite hotel) with fresh flowers, beautiful fruit bowls ...you get our drift. Yoga on the lawn every morning..tick...an extremely well appointed gym..tick..3 crystal clear swimming pools..tick. However, the staff are the greatest asset. GM Hans leads an amazing team. Our beautiful breakfast host Widarthi has been at The Legian for 22years & it is clear why their staff have a great retention rate. They genuinely look happy to welcome you by name at EVERY interaction. And we’re not talking a 10 room B&B here. This is our 2nd stay & it won’t be our last. THANKYOU for a perfect week at The Legian. Evette & Bernie🙏🏽",The Legian Seminyak Bali
462,FABULOUS IN EVERY WAY,50,October 2018,"This hotel is sublime. The staff are incredibly professional, they all speak perfect english & they have the ability to be unobtrusive but yet anticipate their guests' every need. Every staff member knew our names (we're convinced they have to memorise all their guests's names & faces) & they were so friendly & welcoming. Even the hotel manager made a point of greeting everyone at breakfast & spent time getting to know all the guests.

The breakfasts were delicious with an incredible choice of fabulous food- anything from Bircher museli to Asian cuisine. We also ate dinner in the restaurant which was superb (& surprisingly good value for money.)

What I absolutely loved about this hotel though was the attention to detail. The management thought of everything. Our suite had the most relaxing music set up on an ipod to play quietly in the background, lovely candles to create a soothing environment, we had delicious snacks in the minibar (actually more of a kitchen), & a really useful beach bag was provided for our stay. They go the extra mile & more :) One example is that I had asked, on the first day, if I could have a jug of milk sent to our room to make tea & from that day it appeared in my fridge without me ever asking again. It's this type of service that makes a hotel stay so relaxing & stress free.

My husband was super happy there was a sauna & decent gym at the hotel too, oh & the best wifi connection out of all the hotels we stayed in in Bali (even on the beach!).

If ever you go to Seminyak, don't stay anywhere else. You won't regret it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
463,Just Superb!,50,October 2018,"Stayed at The Legian for a few days and it was pure perfection! It’s astonishing that this hotel is over 22 years old and running like clockwork. Right in the heart of where it’s all happening, beautifully maintained and the service is impeccable. Some resorts fade away when entering their old age but this “grand old lady” is just getting better. 24 hours after checking in the staff calls you by your name and knows exactly what you like and dislike. This kind of boutique luxury is hard to find these days and I think they are doing an outstanding job. Hans the GM is very visible, leading from the front and running The Legian with Swiss precision. Well done to the Legian team, I will be back !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
464,Superb location - luxury hotel,50,October 2018,"We were only here for one night, staying in a beautiful deluxe suite with a wonderful balcony with its own day bed. We loved the hotel. The service is fantastic throughout, and it is just a short walk to a whole host of great shops and restaurants.

The beach, just in front of the hotel is huge, clean, and quiet.

The Legian is a beautiful hotel, that certainly lives up to its status as a 'Leading Hotel of the World'

We will certainly return for longer next time we are in Bali",The Legian Seminyak Bali
465,"Perfect Location, Exceptional Service",50,October 2018,"The Legian is an extremely well managed hotel. The service is exceptional, from bell boys, front desk, concierge, restaurant and pool staff. Everyone has a smile on their face and nothing is too much trouble. They anticipate your requirements. Food and accomodation is of a very high standard. We could not find fault with this hotel. I have traveled widely for work and pleasure and this is up there with the best. Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
466,5*,50,October 2018,"Every room is ocean view. The living room area and terrace is spacious. The restaurant faces the infinity pool & the ocean - and dinner is as top notch as any other meal. The staffs are very attentive, polite and friendly. So another 5 stars for the staffs.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
467,Dream hotel,50,October 2018,"We had the most fantastic time at The Legian. The hotel is truly beautiful and everyone is extremelly friendly. It makes you to want to smile all the time!
Breakfasts and afternoon teas were yummy and watching the sunsets from the pool was the best experience!
Our room was a dream and the service was superb!
Hopefully we’ll come back one day soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
468,Amazing pool villas,50,October 2018,"We stayed at the club, private pool villas at the Legian Seminyak. Amazing villas with outstanding service. There are 14 villas at the club, each with a private butler, complimentary mini bar, 4-6pm tea service, 6-8pm complimentary drinks & snacks & a chauffeur driven car for drop & pick up anywhere in Seminyak. Our butler Komang was exceptionally wonderful. Its a must visit to this property. I would give a 11 on 10 rating to the service.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
469,Understated sophistication & elegance,50,October 2018,"With travelling to many other international destinations, coming back to THE LEGIAN in Bali after 4 years was way too long. We are into day 4 of our 7 day stay here, and it has been again such a delightful respite from the hectic pace of life. For the sophisticated traveler, THE LEGION is really a 'home away from home. The quiet attention to detail by the staff is subtle yet always appreciated. Their genuineness and incredible ability to remember the names of every guest is so impressive.
Being a member of Leading Hotels of the World sets a benchmark of expectation. THE LEGIAN surpasses and delivers this in every aspect. The rooms are incredibly spacious with a welcoming & relaxing decor. The breakfasts...amazing! The gym...sensational! The position and ambiance...first class!
THE LEGIAN is an experience of quiet luxurious indulgence for those who seek it. Highly recommended",The Legian Seminyak Bali
470,"Amazing setting, fabulous staff, beautiful hotel...will be difficult to beat!",50,October 2018,"We stayed as a family of 5 in a 2 bedroom (2 bathroom) suite (all rooms are ocean facing). The rooms were immaculate with everything we needed and nothing was too much trouble if we required anything during our stay. All the staff were very friendly and professional (drivers, security, housekeeping,pool attendants, wait staff etc etc). The food was great and well priced for a hotel of The Legian’s standard. The managers, Alain & Hans were very friendly and accessible at all times during our stay. The location is fantastic - just a short walk to the middle of Seminyak and the beach out the front was clean and not ever busy.
We would stay at The Legian again any time and can’t think of another hotel/ resort we’ve stayed in that has had such a high level of personalised service and attention to detail. Thanks from room 334...we’ll be back!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
471,Good - But.....,40,October 2018,"We stayed at the Legian last week for 5 days. It is a very pleasant relatively small resort style hotel with very efficient service and a beautiful ocean view from the majority of suites. The level of efficiency and attention to detail is obvious with emails received from the hotel the week prior to arrival; and the swift personalised check-in on arrival. The suite we stayed in was spacious and comfortable but dark I.e. needed interior lights on during the day, even on a full-sun day. On one of the days that it was overcast (and there can be many later in the year), the lack of natural light made the room uninviting and a bit depressing. I understand that management are aware of this and are undertaking a project to see how this can be fixed. Staff at the hotel are exceptionally well trained and management is attentive. However, one thing really spoiled that sense of customer service being any more than a set of well trained procedures (greetings and knowing your name) was when we asked for a late check-out and offered to pay - and even move location if our room was specifically required. We were refused. We asked to see the manager but this also was refused, albeit politely. A compromise was given where we could stay an extra hour in our room and use a vacant suite in the hour prior to departure to freshen up. It was a very hot day, so we waited in the lobby for 2 hours and brought forward our departure to the airport. I fully appreciate not being able to have a late check-out if the hotel is completely full. However, when this is not the case and the offer to pay for the room is made, I am at a loss as to why it would be refused. The only thing I can think of is that the hotel is so highly proceduralised, that our request somehow fell between the cracks of some tick-box. Having paid approximately $1,000 per night (including tax), I expect more in customer service. Unfortunately, this experience left a poor impression.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
472,One of the best!,50,October 2018,"This was our first visit to Bali and via own research and recommendations picked The Legian Hotel in Seminyak and in summary this was first class and ensured that we enjoyed a very special holiday.

From the moment that we were met at the airport and following a very personal check-in process we knew we were in a special hotel. Then we entered our 1 bed sea-facing suite which was a real delight. Throughout our stay we experienced real luxury enjoying yoga classes, spa treatments and fab food.

More important however was the genuine friendliness of all staff members and the management should be proud of the team they have!

As a tip, if you can push to a 1 bed, sea-face suite then take the plunge as they are fab! Hope to go back again one day in the not too distant future!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
473,Magic in a tropical paradise,50,September 2018,"Our bucket list had the Singapore Grand Prix and the island of Bali still unticked, so we managed to combine the two. We chose The Legian Bali after much research to find some R & R after a cruise and Grand Prix package. Our transfer from Densapar Airport was ‘interesting’ as the driver and guide took a shortcut off the busy main road through narrow and dark housing streets. For a few moments it felt as if we were being kidnapped!

Then - we arrived at the resort and immediately, the WOW factor kicked in as we were greeted and checked in with some style and impressive politeness to what was clearly a special place. Better still, we were kindly upgraded to a one bed luxury suite. Our jaws dropped as we entered our suite - it was a large and beautifully furnished apartment, pleasantly decorated with a kitchen, dining area and living room to the side of which was a spacious bedroom with a wide and netted four poster bed, adjoins a fabulous bath room with his and hers separate basins, a large bath, separate shower and we. Beyond the living area, doors slid open to reveal a large and wide balcony with views across immaculate gardens to the Indian Ocean shore.

After a good night’s sleep and a high quality breakfast, we spent the day resting with convivial fellow guests (mostly friendly Australians) beside the largest of three infinity pools, which cascade down to the sandy shore and oceanside. We were pampered and entertained by amazing, charming staff in great comfort in a perfect tropical climate. We stayed for a week and the very pleasant atmosphere, attentive staff, perfect foods continued flawlessly during the whole of our stay. I was struck by the manner in which the resort staff, most of whom spoke good English, met us on level terms rather than kowtowing in any way. It became clear from this and a local walk that the Bali people are lovely. Mostly Balinese Hindus, their way of life combines their religion with their lifestyle and culture in a charming and intelligent way that is very appealing.

In resort, we needed help with onward travel arrangements and were assisted most efficiently by the deputy assistant manager, Anggun for whom nothing was too much trouble. She and the pool area supervisors were interesting to chat with and from whom we learned quite a lot about Bali people and Bali living. Thank you all for making our holiday so perfect. Our week’s stay passed all to quickly.

While at the resort we watched charming Balinese dancers and orchestra perform traditional dancing as we dined and on occasion, by the pools, an enjoyable jazz trio entertaining us at teatime. Teatime is a pleasant moment when sweet delicacies are served from tiered stands accompanied, if you so choose, by delicious Lemongrass and Ginger Tea brewed from fresh ingredients.

Our impressions of this beautiful and well located resort were reinforced by local guides and drivers, who told us we had chosen the best hotel in Seminyak.

If you want a perfect seaside resort, be it for rest and relaxation with subtle pampering or as a base for excursions, The Legian Bali in our experience is a place that should meet your everybody expectation. If you want quality spa treatments, such as a Balinese massage, steam room, hot and cold jacuzzi pools or a sauna, it’s all there for you in house. We hope to return on future breaks en route London to Sydney where we have family.

Thanks again, Legian, for hosting us during a perfect stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
474,A complete joy,50,September 2018,"We sadly leave today... a truly amazing stay. Wonderful food, accommodation, grounds, and exceptional staff. There is nothing but praise to give this wonderful hotel and the whole team. Thank you so much.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
475,World Class Experience,50,September 2018,"My fiancé and I stayed there for almost a week, and it was simply not enough time to do all activities that are planned for the guests each evening. We were lucky enough to watch Olive Ridley Turtles run to water at high tide. The three infinity pools invite you to spend the day soaking up the breath taking view of the spotless beaches. I enjoyed looking for geckos, frogs, and wildlife each evening and noticed they upgraded my flashlight to a LED. The staff pays attention to every little detail of your stay, so much so that you are left feeling you are the only guest on the premises. The breakfast was outstanding and the dinner we had their one evening was deliciously prepared. Don’t miss tea time! Special thanks to Anggun, Dewy, Ari, Hans, Allen, Eddie, Romi, Mirah, and everyone whom we had the pleasure of interacting with. You all really made our stay wonderful and a home away from home! We look forward to future stays at The Legian, Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
476,Exceptional quality,50,September 2018,"My partner and I are currently staying at the Legian hotel and we are absolutely loving our time here. It has a fantastic setting on the beach, lovely garden, and lovely features such as the many ponds and koi carp; it is also easy walking distance to many bars and restaurants. Our room overlooks the ocean and the balcony is great to people watch, as so many people are walking along the beach. The breakfast is superb with lots of juices, cereals, pastries and the chefs can cook you a hot breakfast of eggs, bacon and a lot more. However what makes this hotel so wonderful is the service; the room and the hotel is immaculate, and also the staff, everyone is so friendly and helpful, and you are made to feel so welcome. Thank you Alain and the whole team for a great time.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
477,Heavenly Bali,50,September 2018,"First time coming back to Bali in 15 years and certainly won’t be waiting that long to return. The Legian exceeded my expectations. Food, accommodation, we stayed in a one bedroom pool villa, service, location, spa and staff were all amazing. Morning yoga overlooking the beach started the day off perfectly. Highly recommend if your looking for some luxury in a fabulous location.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
478,One Bedroom Villa-Amazing!,50,September 2018,"We just got back from a 5 night stay in a one-bedroom Villa at this lovely resort. All of the 5-Star reviews on this site are very well-earned. Each one of the staff from the guards who stop traffic so you can cross the street, to the wait staff to our amazing private butler offered us exceptional service.

Our villa was private, quiet and so relaxing. It included a complimentary mini bar stocked with snacks and cold drinks. We had our laundry washed and folded each day which was so nice. We also had access to a car which took us to dinner in Seminyak and our pick up was also arranged which was such a nice treat.

We were also able to access happy hour each night at any of the hotel bars (or in our room which we didn't take advantage of). Sitting by the beach having a drink and watching the beautiful Bali sunset each night was amazing! The perfect way to spend the early evening.

On our last day as we were leaving for the airport I was suddenly not feeling well. The very kind hotel nurse interrupted her dinner to see me and give me some anti-nausea pills and offered to get me to see the doctor. It was really helpful and so appreciated, but by the last day of our trip we stopped being surprised by any amazing service we received here as everyone at the hotel continuously out-did themselves.

As a special treat on our last night we were invited down to the beach to be part of the release of the just hatched baby turtles into the ocean. What a beautiful way to end our stay.

Exceptional circumstances aside it would be difficult to find fault with this property. My husband and I have been to some of the nicest places in the world and we are so fortunate to be able to add The Legian Villas to the list. We hope circumstance will allow us to return someday soon.We thank all of the staff and management for making our visit so special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
479,Love this hotel,50,August 2018,"We felt so welcome here, service is fantastic, nothing a problem. Traveling with my mother who has onset dementia meant we had to stay in the hotel most of the time so she didn’t get confused... We were also grateful for the room upgrade & birthday cake in our room was a lovely surprise!
Vegan food options available yet wish for them to be a little more modernized which will be apparently when they get a new chef.
Will definitely be back to stay another time.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
480,Holiday,50,October 2017,"Great place lotsa good shopping met some great people great beach good food and beer, locals helped us to understand money very honest.we loved walking along here was busy and quite different times of day .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
481,"Class, Elegance and incomparable service.",50,September 2018,"On arrival to the Joglo Club Villa, we couldn't help but feel that we were in for a unique experience. The rooms and surrounding living area are kept in impeccable condition day and night. Your every wish is met by the always on hand staff, and the facilities and amenities are truly world class.

Whether it was lounging in our own private pool, or enjoying the famous Bali sunset at the main pool bar, we couldn't help but immerse ourselves in what must be the best of what Bali & Indonesia has to offer.

This resort is a perfect balance between Modern and Balinese architecture and is situated a few minutes walking distance to the main Seminyak strip but far enough to feel extremely secluded from the beautiful manic that is Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
482,Some hotels get tired and some age with class. This is the layer,50,September 2018,Beautiful setting. In immaculate condition. This is a beach outlook and setting to rival any in the world. The food and service is excellent but the location is the real winner . You can tell it’s not new but it still looks and feels great .pay up its worth it,The Legian Seminyak Bali
483,"Absolutely perfect,the best yet?",50,August 2018,"We spent 8 nights in a 1 bedroom club Villa at the Legian for our honeymoon.For the whole of our stay the Legian was perfect. They truly are blessed with superb staff especially our Butler Agus who was fantastic and thoughtful during the whole stay. Never intrusive but always there, without doubt one of the nicest and most genuine people we have ever met. Every part of the whole resort runs like clockwork and is so well organised but still remaining personal with everybody knowing your name. The resort and accommodation is impeccable, very clean, very tidy, i'm not sure how you could improve. The food is also excellent, the breakfast fantastic and varied, the pool area food again fantastic and of superb quality. The only minor gripe we would have would be the price of the a la carte restaurant onsite, again excellent quality but a little expensive compared to a comparable standard, a minor issue as this tends to be the case with on resort menus at most luxury hotels so was not a surprise. To summarise i would say that this overall this has to be the best resort we have ever stopped at, we have travelled a lot through business and pleasure and would not make these claims lightly! Book it, you will not regret it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
484,Best Hotel In Seminyak,50,August 2018,"We spent 5 nights at The Legian for our honeymoon. The hotel was a great experience. The place is beautiful, very relaxing and in the perfect location in Seminyak to explore the area. The staff was incredible in every way. We had an issue booking through a 3rd party and Alain the hotel manager came to the rescue in minutes to rectify a complex situation. Also, don’t miss out on the breakfast here. It is top notch! Great overall experience would definitely come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
485,Only stayed one night,40,August 2018,"We arrived at The Legian after transferring from The Four Seasons in Ubud. We thought a few nights in the rain forest and then longer at the beach.
Unfortunately it was at the time when the earthquake hit Lombok and we had to run from our hotel in Ubud as our hotel felt the after shocks.
I was a little concerned then transferring to the beach the following day, as i was worried having our 11 year old daughter and any possibilities of tsunami.
We arrived mid afternoon and the hotel reception was impressive with the view on to a glorious pool and then on to the ocean. The sea was really rough, too rough to swim and the red flags were on the beach.
We had light bites to eat next to the ocean that evening and if the sea had been calm, it would have been wonderful.
I’m a bit of a worrier and the rough sea and the previous nights earthquake made it impossible for us to relax, and as we went to bed that evening, there was another tremor, so we phoned our travel agent and requested the next available flight to Singapore, which we had already booked, but left Bali six nights early.
We felt upset to leave the Legian behind and the staff were obviously upset to see us leave early, but we needed to leave.
I’m sure if the earthquake hadn’t erupted then the stay would have been wonderful, as the setting & hotel were lovely and the staff couldn’t do more to make you feel welcome. Sorry we didn’t get to finish our holiday with you!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
486,The best hotel in Seminyak if not Bali,50,August 2018,"It is quite rare these days to find an exceptional hotel that delights in every way. The Legian is such a hotel. To say this hotel is exceptionally good would be to understate it. The accommodation (we stayed in a two bedroom suite), the team, the facilities, the spa and the restaurants are faultless. The team here in particular are so welcoming and nothing is too much for them. Every member of the team knew our name and took time to talk to us, always enquiring if we needed anything. My congratulations to the hotel management.

If we return to Bali in the future, there is no doubt we will stay here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
487,"Wow, just wow!!! Incredible place.",50,August 2018,"My family (2 kidsm 2 adults) have traveled around the globe and I have to say this is by far the best resort we have ever stayed at. The room was incredible, food impeccable and the staff/service...wow! Can't say enough great things about this place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
488,The Legian is Legiandary,50,August 2018,"Had a fantastic family 5 night stay in the Sunset Villa at the Legian, Seminyak. The hotel staff were professional, attentive and friendly. This was our first visit to Bali and we really enjoyed our stay at the Legian. Would highly recommend this hotel to others - we will most certainly be back soon...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
489,The best luxury resort in Seminyak,50,August 2018,"My second time at Legian, and I love it. Everyone who is familiar with Seminyak says the same: for a luxury resort, Legian is the best in Seminyak as the other resorts don’t keep the same standard. It’s beautiful for sunset and food is excellent! All rooms have seaview and you hear the sound of the ocean in your room.
The only minus is that the decor in the rooms soon needs to be freshened up. Otherwise all perfect!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
490,Ticks every box,50,August 2018,"Had another special holiday with my family at the Legian. The have excellent 2 bedroom apartments. The location perfect and the food and service can’t be faulted.
Spa and gym also good. Continues to live up to its reputation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
491,Peaceful and serene. The hidden gem of bali,50,June 2018,"The best hotel i’ve stayed. Not luxurious but it’s very private and a very intimate service by the staff. Everything is so personalized

The spa over there is amazing too, really really worth it.

Will never forget the legian experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
492,Outstanding in every way imaginable!,50,April 2018,"Hands down this hotel will provide you with the best service in the world!
From the moment you walk in to the moment you have to leave for the airport, the staff have got you covered. The hotel offers a safe, key location, with great breakfast and room service and not to mention the most incredible sunsets on the island.
Again the service is second to none, being a seasoned traveller their service has never been outdone.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
493,Pure paradise,50,September 2017,"This was by far the best experience we have had in our wordy travels. They operate at a level above and beyond every other luxury resort. The room, food, staff and ambiance are what you would expect for being pampered and having nomcare in the world. We can not recommend this place enough for anyone looking to have a truly wonderful experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
494,Amazing. Again.,50,August 2018,"I’ve reviewed the Legian before. I’m pleased to say nothing has diminished my view that this is a great hotel. Location is fantastic, right on the beach. Whilst Seminyak is chaotic the hotel is nicely removed behind a high wall and beautiful gardens. The building is meticulously maintained and stunning, with all suites (there are no “rooms”) bars and the dining room oriented to the water and the pools. The food is excellent and despite eating dinner out a lot at nearby Bambu, La Lucciola and others, we’re always reminded just how good the hotel food is when we do dine in. Breakfast is a three hour event for us (and many others). The staff are remarkable: many have been with the hotel since day one twenty two years ago. The fact that the hotels ownership has never changed must help explain the extraordinary standard of service that has been a consistent feature of my many stays. This year we did experience a first; a earthquake measuring 7 on the nearby Island of Lombok at about 7.45pm. The whole hotel shook for maybe thirty seconds. By the time we made our way outside and accompanied another neighbouring guest downstairs it was as if nothing had happened. The staff were busily serving dinner in the main restaurant, guests had filled the two waterside bars and were ordering drinks and snacks. Shortly after the two managers were on site reassuring guests and staff and before nights end we’d received a note in our room providing information on the situation. We now see repeat guests we’ve come to know over the years, including a Jakarta local that visits EVERY weekend, arriving on the first flight on Saturday and departing last flight Sunday for TEN years; surely that says I’m not alone in thinking the Legian is something special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
495,OMG why don't they allow 6 stars!,50,June 2018,"First off we stayed at the club in a pool villa so cannot compare to main hotel, that said what an experience. Got a call day before arrival asking why we hadn't booked airport pick up after advising we were already in Bali they said give us the address we will collect you which they promptly did.

Upon arrival we were met by the GM cool towels in car and on arrival cool drinks quick hi anything you need etc then the butler Yoni took us to our villa no check in just showed us everything and once happy we were settled took cc and passport which were returned 15 mins later no fuss.

Room: the villas are stunning well laid out big seated area outside Bali along pool end of pool sunloungers and small lounge inside. Big four poster bed with mosquito net around and Bose sound system in living room and bedroom with iPods 11000 songs downloaded, big walk in shower his and hers wardrobes robes slippers beach bags... mini bar and snacks were excellent skwsts topped up by the ninja butler and a big outdoor coveted bath.

Food: champagne bar was amazing couldn't do enough to serve you even ordered off menu on one occasion which they sorted out no fuss. Cocktail hour seemed to last all night although it's 2 hours and it was always quiet with great views over the beach. Bfast again stunning and on the last day ate at the club and they brought us the smoothie from the main restaurant that we mentioned we liked so much. The food was a 5 out of 5 every meal and the service to, the staff are very well trained there was an incident with a guest in trouble in the pool and the first person in to assist was the waiter who showed he had been trained in lifesaving and then the hotel nurse arrived with a medical bag... never seen this before but wasn't surprised as this hotel couldn't be faulted.

Location: the main hotel is on the beach the villas are directly behind it hidden away like a little private bubble, golf carts to take you back and forth and security to stop traffic when you cross the road. The hotel has 2 level infinity pool over looking the beach and is very tastefully decorated inside and out.

Services: at the villa you have a butler and the rest of the hotel staff seems to know you're in a villa and act accordingly, the service is second to none and no idea what to do with the butler but we found a few things but not much ... left with our holidays clothes washed and pressed and in the case of shirts and a dress either folded on cardboard or hung in a dress cover ... thought of everything.

I'm probably missing out stuff but I will find it with this would of got a 6 if I could give it as it is without doubt the best hotel I've ever stated at for everything I couldn't fault it, actually considered staying an extra 3 nights and losing our paid booking on another hotel it was that good.

Massive thank you to Yoni our butler and Alain the GM, hope to see you again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
496,Amazing honeymoon! Amazing service :-),50,July 2018,"Wow! The Legian always deliver above expectations. We started our honeymoon here, and we had an amazing stay. The service is on another level at the Legian.

I was here back in 2011 and was afraid that it would be difficult to meet our expectations with a new visit. Especially since we have stayed at some very good resorts in Bali since my last visit here - also new resorts in the Seminyak area. The Legian was amazing back in 2011, but have somehow managed to do it even better now. You will not find a better place to stay in Seminyak - in my opinion. Thank you!

Best regards,
Joakim & Nina",The Legian Seminyak Bali
497,Perfection,50,July 2018,"I couldn't dream of giving this place anything except five stars. It's true it's expensive and it's a big hotel and I don't normally like big hotels but oh my goodness it was wonderful!

We stayed in a one bedroom villa across a small road from the hotel and everything about it was impeccable. The villa was simply beautiful, the pool was warm and inviting, the outdoor bath filled with petals which was waiting for us on arrival was stunning. Our butler, Hendra, could not do enough for us. He was effortlessly charming and worked very hard to ensure we had a good stay - we wish we could have brought him home with us! Cocktails at the villa restaurant each night were tasty, complimentary and came with scrummy canapes.

Sadly we only stayed two nights but in that time we didn't leave the hotel. Normally we are straight out the door and off to see the sights but we couldn't tear ourselves away from the pool, the beautiful beach and the fantastic food. On our first evening there was a Balinese dance display with traditional food in the restaurant - the steamed fish was the best thing that I ate in Bali.

The service at the beach was also impeccable, within moments of arriving a day bed overlooking the ocean was found for us, drinks were brought and face mist was provided to keep us cool in the heat. I took advantage of the beach massage services and can thoroughly recommend them.

Given the price it would have to be a special occasion to bring us back but if we get the opportunity we'll be on the first flight out.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
498,A market leader and a must do (at sunset),50,July 2018,"Have been to the bar at the Legian Hôtel a few times and am always impressed.

Personalized and engaging service.
Topped with an incredible view, what else do you need?

You could say it is expensive, I do not. It is high value as you get what you pay for. Not your typical multinational multi branded chain experience. The team here looks after you with ease, totally naturally and why I keep coming back.

Thank you to the team and the leaders who have guided them over the years. Well done. And please stop refilling my grissini sticks.. once you start you can’t stop!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
499,Wonderful,40,June 2018,"We spent 10 days in a Club Villa and it was wonderful.

The staff are amazing and the service standard above all other hotels we have stayed at. Nothing was too much trouble and the breakfast variety superb. The security guards were fantastic - especially with my son who went across to the surf beach regularly.

The only disappointing aspect was the butler service. It was fantastic the first couple of days then we were pretty much forgotten. We had a lot of extras included like afternoon tea and cocktails as part of the club package. We were offered this the first couple of days then never saw our heard from our butler nor offered this again - unless we called and organised it ourselves.

We asked our butler if she was busy and she said she wasn’t but we still never saw or heard from her unless we called her. The last day of our stay she offered to pack for us which I was super excited about - but it never happened as she said she would come back to do this but never did!

Given we paid a large premium to stay at the club villas we felt disappointed by this. It was super expensive so this made us question the cost given our butler experience.

Apart from the butler service, the staff were fantastic and we had a wonderful stay. The villas are really beautiful and very quiet.

A very big thank you to Suta who looked after us in the Club lounge and Timotius (Club Manager) who promptly attended to our laundry issues with such professionalism.

Thank you again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
500,THE only place to stay whilst on Bali,50,July 2018,"We would not normally write review of a hotel until we had reached the end of our stay but on this occasion we feel it necessary to do write it now.
From the moment you step into this place you feel special, the attention to detail is outstanding and everyone, without exception, always greets you with a welcoming smile and nothing is too much trouble. The suites are spacious and clean and all the public areas are kept in immaculate order.
Whilst all this is great the icing on cake, so to speak, is that yesterday I just mentioned in passing that today was my birthday and this morning when our breakfast arrived at our room I was presented with a birthday card from the manager and the team along with a cake with candles. This is just another indication of the attention to detail that is indicative of this place.
We would recommend this hotel to anyone as THE only place to stay when visiting Bali.
Thank you Alain and each and every member of your team for continuing to make our stay one to remember.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
501,The perfect honeymoon destination,50,July 2018,"We stayed at one of the gorgeous villas in the Club at The Legian and had an absolutely fantastic experience. The room, facilities and hotel were simply breathtaking and the service was even better. Upon check in we were given our own Butler named Komang who was super friendly and attentive and made our experience even more special. The food was delicious including room service and the attention to detail across the board was second to none.

Could not recommend enough - it was perfect.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
502,Honeymoon Perfection,50,June 2018,"We have recently returned from a memorable 10 nights at the Legian Bali. Our experience surpassed all of our expectations. The rooms, service, grounds, breakfast, everything is simply excellent here. The hotel has a metronomy, all the staff were friendly and did everything they could to ensure our stay was the best it could be. We felt truly cared for at the Legian. On the days we were not out on excursions we found the grounds and amenities absolute bliss. The sunbeds/daybeds are varied and very comfortable, situated in great locations. The food at the Legian is absolutely stunning. We had breakfast daily, the selection was perfect, all tastes catered for. We had an incredible dining experience on a Tuesday with an Indonesian sampling menu, Balinese dancers moving to the flow of the Gamelan. Our time at the Legian will be fondly remembered, thankyou for such great memories and we hope to see you again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
503,One of the most amazing hotels,50,July 2018,This hotel is outstanding. They cater to everyone of your needs before you can even think of what you need. For example I was at the pool and one of the pool boys saw me using my computer and propping it up with my knees and immediately brought over a lap desk. Pools are amazing. I had a one bedroom suite ocean view which was amazing. Breakfast was amazing and offered many different types of views. Breakfast overlooked the ocean. Tea time was tea/coffee and 3 little snacks. We had the Indonesian dinner which was pretty good but I wouldn’t say all dishes were amazing but it my own preference. All in all this place goes above expectations and everyone is so friendly. I do not say this easily so you can trust me when I say you will love this place!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
504,Favorite Hotel!,50,June 2018,"The Legian doesn’t really need another stellar review , but here is is anyway! When we arrived after a LONG journey (30+ hours from start to finish) the check in staff offered us cool towels, a nice cold drink, and the statement “we are going to take care of you now...” .and that is what they did! Everyone at the hotel is so lovely, they really do know your name, what you like for breakfast, where you like to sit by the beach. We are not super wealthy luxury travelers but we do make one nice trip annually, and our kids (now teens) both stated this is their favorite hotel in the world. Yes, it is expensive, but it is 100% worth it. Thank you for a wonderful experience!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
505,Luxury! mmm,50,June 2018,"What a lovely resort! Beach front and beautiful gardens. Rooms with magnificent views and service that’s first class. Spacious rooms and a turn down service not many else in Bali offers with attention to detail. When the hotel manger greets you on arrival, chats at breakfast and sees you off when you leave then you know your in a luxury resort. Pay for what you get and this is worth the money. My wife and I will be back again any chance we get (without the kids). Thanks Alan (The Manager) for a great time and well done. It’s the simple things in life that make a difference. Nailed it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
506,Bali Balance,50,May 2018,"This is a trip of a lifetime. At the Legian you are welcomed with kindness and beauty. The multi level infinity pool adds to a breathtaking landscape. Enjoy outdoor yoga with the sounds of the waves hugging the shore line. The spa will melt away the toxins of everyday life. The chef’s creativity served us decadent delights all week. Walking distance to local shopping, restaurants and tailors (we had custom suits made in two days!).",The Legian Seminyak Bali
507,Short Break,40,July 2018,Had a couple of days spare so thought 2 nights at The Legian would be great - it was excellent but far too many small children with rich parents who don’t want to supervise them. One of the great hotels but my tip is - don’t go in school holidays!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
508,Club villa at The Legian Hotel,50,June 2018,"This was a 4 night stay to relax and recover from the jet lag from our flight from Uk and to prepare ourselves for a hectic schedule when we would join our daughter and family at the Sofitel resort (reviewed later) in Nusa Dua.

We stayed in a 1 bed Villa at the Club which is immediately across the road from the main hotel. The Club has its own very large swimming pool,a bar and dining area besides a smaller pool in the Villa itself. The villa itself is a completely private space.

You could breakfast in your villa,in the club dining area or join the throng at the main hotel.Ditto lunch and dinner.

All the amenities of the villa,spirits,wine beer,snacks were complimentary and refilled daily.

Our personal butler,Bona, was exceptional. I called him our personal Genie, as he was able to grant all our wishes — and we didn’t even have to rub a lamp.

The Club was just perfect for our needs. It was peaceful and quiet. We did venture over to the main hotel a few times. The beach was immaculate and there appeared to be plenty of beds around.

All our meals were of a great standard and service was first class == with a smile!

If you want what we wanted from this holiday,you really couldn’t find anywhere better to stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
509,A new benchmark for customer experience!,50,June 2018,"Wow. Just W.O.W. I don't even know where to start with writing this review. We travel to Bali regularly and normally stay at the Padma or The W. Not anymore...because we just found the best hotel in the entire world!

The hotel itself is beautiful. From the arrival area to the stunning infinity pool looking over the ocean, the hotel is visually breathtaking. But its the staff and the simple finishing touches that make this hotel first class. To be called by your name (by every staff member) is such a simple pleasantry, but it sums up the exceptional standard of professionalism that this hotel strives for. From the security team on the front entrance and beach gate, to the staff in The Restaurant and Pool Bar, the service is genuine and non-intrusive. I could list off names but I would take up the entire review with the names of the employees who contributed to our experience. The hotel even has its own lifeguard who gave us tips on body-boarding (the hotel has its own boards you can borrow) and then kept an eye on us as we spent a fun-filled hour taking on the waves out the front of hotel!

The rooms have everything you could wish for. We were in a ""basic"" Studio Suite and honestly, it was a home away from home. From the day bag to take down to the pool to the biscuits and complimentary mini bar and snacks, this hotel doesn't miss a trick.

There is a gym, a spa and yoga classes. The Restaurant is a fine dining experience not to be missed and the snapper cooked in banana leaves is delicious. The breakfast is out of this world (and so are the wonderful team who greet you each morning).

The Legian is a luxury getaway like no other - we're already planning our next trip and cannot wait to return. Thank to the wonderful team at The Legian for making all of your guests feel like family.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
510,5 Star Service,50,June 2018,"A truly 5 star resort hotel with a 5 star service from the minute we arrived to the minute we checked out, everything about this hotel was perfect. Attention to details is second to none with everyone greeting us by our names, which was a nice personal touch.

This is the second time we visited Bali, having stayed at The W Bali previously. The Legian is in a great location on Seminyak beach and less than 5 minute walk from Seminyak Square. We stayed for 7 nights in a 2 bedroom suite, the accommodation was spacious and the master bedroom has a great sea view. The pool area is a great place to relax with plenty of sun loungers and large daybeds during our stay in June, nothing was too much trouble for the pool staff.

I would say The Legian is on par with other luxury 5 star hotels with the likes of Mandarin Oriental and Banyan Tree, and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
511,Outstanding service,50,June 2018,"Excellent to see that our favourite hotel hasn't changed a bit, it has even improved with time. My family, including two children aged 8 and 9, and grandparents, were fortunate enough to have an incredible 7-night stay. It felt like we were walking on air when we left. Many thanks to Alain and his wonderful team at the Legian. Truly a gem of a hotel and a very special place. Special thanks to the attentive life guards surveying the beach and the wonderful ladies in the restaurant - some of whom like Kaya have been working there for 22 years!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
512,OUTSTANDING,50,June 2018,"When deciding where to go on your next Bali trip and you want a little bit of luxury I can not recommend this place anymore. My wife and I have had a week here and the service, rooms, meals and amenities are as good as we have experienced. The staff cater for your every need and go out of their way for you. The manager Alain makes a point every day to come and say hello and chases honest feedback. Great location and cant wait to come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
513,Fantastic Resort,50,June 2018,"Stayed for 3 nights at the 2 bedroom suite. It was an enjoyable moment and we felt cozy during the stay. Room was spacious, multiple aircon can be set individually fron each room, spacious bathroom in each room especially the master one with full Acqua Di Parma amenities, a pantry with fully equipped with nespresso machine, fully stocked coffee, tea, softdrinks, mineral water, refreshed daily is provided free of charge. Breakfast was also included with plenty of choice and delicious taste. The hotel has 2 pools overlooking the Indian Ocean, an excellent spot to see the sunset. Beach in front of the hotel was also easily accessible, clean, so you van take morning jog or walk along the beach with comfort. We also use some of the gym facility which is properly equipped with aerobic and weight stations. A free morning yoga class is also available. If you like to stroll around by your own, there are some Piaggio scooters you can rent. Seminyak Village and the center of Seminyak area is within walking distance where you can shop and dine there. The hotel also provide airport transfer with luxury MPV should you need. Thank you to the hotel manager who always walk around to meet guests and check the facility. If I may suggest the bed in our master suite is a bit sagged, so I guess it us about time to be replaced. Highly recommended and we will come back on our next Bali visit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
514,Joglo Club Villa Perfection,50,June 2018,"We chose to stay at the Joglo Club Villa to celebrate a major Birthday and this place was PERFECTION.

Everything was handled with great ease starting with the swift arrival and handling at the airport and arrival directly at our Villa.

We immediately met our Butler, Bona. Sweet man. Dedicated. Professional and handled every request personally. Bona made our ""decompression holiday "" the perfect 8 days we had hoped for.

The staff in general are all well trained. I had alerted the resort prior to our arrival of food allergies, likes and dislikes. It seemed everyone was communicated with and we were quite impressed.

The Spa. Bliss. We had very specific requests that were outside of their norm but every request was handled. Again to perfection. My therapist, Eka, gave INCREDIBLE massages. You should DEFINITELY request him.

We took a day trip out to Ubud to the John Hardy factory. Our driver, Suta, was terrific and gave us a bit of a history lesson along the way. You must go to the John Hardy factory!

We thoroughly enjoyed meeting some of the Executive staff at their weekly cocktail party. In particular, Stephanie, the Director of Sales, and Alaine, the Hotel Manager. Absolutely delightful.

I wish there was a way in Trip Advisor to rate higher than 5 stars!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
515,Fantastic Resort,50,June 2018,"I is an amazing place to stay in Bali superb accommodation, huge rooms and outstanding service levels the staff here is out of the world great pool and beach all in all a very good property to stay in Bali the best part is their staff always there to help their resort manager Alain was the best so humble and supportive was there to welcome us as well as see us off so kind of him, will only stay here next time in Bali",The Legian Seminyak Bali
516,THE BEST HOTEL WE HAVE EVER STAYED IN,50,June 2018,"The staff in this hotel were just amazing, the setting is stunning and the rooms are to die for. We have stayed in some amazing hotels all over the world but this was with out a doubt the best, pure luxury. It was our anniversary and they couldn't have made it any more special. Big huge thanks for the amazing staff, a fantastic first impression of Bali - we don't want to leave.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
517,Best hotel I’ve stayed in.,50,June 2018,"I came here for five days with my mother and our experience could not have been better. The service was excellent, every staff member was smiley and knew our name and room number by heart and were always happy to fulfil our every request. We were incredibly well looked after for our entire stay and should we have encountered any issues I know they would’ve been dealt with well. Our room was gorgeous with two balconies over looking the sea and it was so lovely hearing the waves crash at night. The poolside complimentary afternoon tea was a lovely touch with yet again amazing service. I took advantage of the morning yoga in the garden which I reccomend if you don’t mind the 8am start. It’s also perfectly situated in the heart of Seminyak only 300m from the main strip with gorgeous shops and restaurants. If you want a luxury experience but close to the hustle and bustle of Seminyak then this is perfect. I absolutely loved my time here and I’m hoping to return again soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
518,Amazing food and scenery,50,June 2018,Although it’s more expensive than most restaurants in Bali it’s definitely worth it. The outside tables are opposite a beautiful pool right on the beach and the food and service is fantastic. I would definitely go back.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
519,Fabulous as always,50,June 2018,"This was my second time to stay at The Legian and it was as wonderful as I remember it to be. Hands down the best resort I've stayed in, ever. I wish I could go back there every year! I love the staff and the way they take care of guests' needs.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
520,Special Hotel,50,May 2018,"This was our third visit to the Legian. As usual it was amazing.

Staying at the Legian feels like being at a very private and exclusive club. It’s an oasis of style and peace within very busy Seminyak.

The staff at the hotel are its best asset, everyone knows your name and you are made to feel very special. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which is spacious and in a classic Balinese style. The views and sound of the ocean are lovely.

Food quality was great, the team even made my favourite Fish sticks from the previous lunch menu! Breakfast is fantastic, a range of great options and the best eggs Benedict and Bircher muesli of the trip!

We love this hotel and hope to stay again soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
521,Great Hotel,50,June 2018,"I stayed three nights in the hotel with my friends, who are regular guests. I have been in many luxery hotels, but this one is special. I had a studio suite for my own. Very spacious room with a big balcony looking over the seaside. The staff is doing a great job to feel you special. GM is always there to know if everybody is happy.
Because the hotel has only about 60 rooms, you are not a number. I had a great time!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
522,Glamorous and Luxurious,50,May 2018,"We have just enjoyed a splendid stay at The Legian - an elegant property in a great location and in excellent condition. We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe suite and it was both luxurious and tasteful.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time at The Legian. The staff were friendly, efficient and polite. We enjoyed the bars and service at the restaurant was first rate. The spa is a particular standout and is very beautifully fitted out and located. The concierge was particularly helpful with informed and helpful advice on the many fine dining options in Seminyak. Housekeeping was first rate and laundry efficient.

The grounds are very well maintained and the beachside of the property, overlooking the beach, is a thousand miles from care - truly relaxing. Service by the pool and sun lounges is excellent and we always felt extremely well looked after.

The Jaya Ibrahim designed interiors really set this resort apart. The timeless and considered elegance of the interiors, punctuated with high quality antiques and art, are a constant joy. The lavish flower arrangements - particularly the tuberoses elevate the interiors to another level of luxury. If design is important to you, as it is to me, then you will truly appreciate this beautifully appointed hotel.

Management were highly evident throughout our stay and engaged with guests in a genuine manner that really impressed me.

This is an extremely beautiful hotel that is very well maintained and excellently managed. I look forward to returning to this glamorous retreat on the Island of the Gods.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
523,Wins the best Seminyak hotel award...,50,May 2018,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my Mum in May.
I’m a travel agent so I’ve been to a lot of the hotels around Seminyak but never stayed here until now.
This hotel offers the best pool in Seminyak, overlooking the beach, with impeccable and friendly service. The views out from the water onto the beach are divine, and it’s the perfect vantage point for those dreamy Balinese sunsets.
We stayed in 105, a 1 bedroom deluxe suite, which I loved for its ground floor views and the ease to stroll out into the manicured garden and to the pool.
I can not fault the room at all. Everything you need, or want. Turndown was lovely with treats and little sayings with frangipani flowers on your pillow. Excellent Acqua Di Parma amenities. Fully stocked minibar and goodies all for free.
The afternoon tea is fabulous, and you can have it wherever you wish.
Sundowners by the pool on the loungers are literally travel perfection.
Service is kind and sincere and again faultless.
Breakfast fantastic too - don’t miss the watermelon jam! So good. As are the pastries and the nasi goreng and Asian choices.
This is a classic and legendary hotel. The style is more traditional but it’s definitely not chintz - just simple, brilliant, and all that you need.
There’s a reason why this hotel (also part of Leading Hotels of the World) has been trusted for so long. It really is fantastic.
Thank you Stephanie and Alain and all of your team for a wonderful stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
524,Loving the Legian...,50,April 2018,"I could honestly say that I was impressed by this property. I loved everything about it. From the beautifully designed lobby, the attentive and accommodating staff, to their spacious suites, for me everything was just perfect. The sand is on the grey tone, but the infinity pool with its view will definitely suffice for the grey sand. The mini bar is free and replenished every day. I would definitely come back...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
525,Great relaxing hotel,40,May 2018,"The Legian is a top quality hotel with top quality service to go with it. The location directly on the beach is fantastic and one of the best spots in Seminyak. Restaurants and cafes are in walking distance too if you don’t want to sit in traffic.

Upon being shown to our Studio Suite which was extremely spacious, I was very disappointed with the lack of wardrobe / storage space, especially for such a large room. However the hotel quickly upgraded us to a Deluxe Suite which had ample storage space for two people (on a 3 week trip overall). This was very much appreciated. The WiFi was a bit sketchy in our room at first but this was quickly rectified.

The rooms have great ocean views and are very traditional looking, which fits the style of the hotel. However in my opinion they can seem quite dark and stale and the wardrobes / drawers have quite a musty smell to them.

Breakfast was very pleasant with good options available and all very tasty. The complimentary yoga classes each morning at 8am are highly recommended.

The service down by the pool was exceptional, including the food and drinks. The guys were so attentive, coming to refill your water constantly throughout the day. It really reassured me too having the security guards at the hotel’s beach entrance.

All staff members from the concierge to the waiters remembered our names which was also very impressive.

I was a little surprised that guests could reserve sun beds early in the morning and then not return until hours later. I wouldn’t necessarily expect this at a top hotel and could imagine it being a nightmare during high season. I don’t find it particularly relaxing to have to worry about getting a sun bed on holiday. I was told that guests can reserve beds on a first come first serve basis, which are then released if they don’t return within an hour. However this definitely wasn’t always the case.

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel when staying in Seminyak and would like to thank the staff for their great service and attention to detail during our stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
526,The Legian. A Legend in Seminak.,50,February 2018,"Wow.

My husband and I treated ourselves to a weekend at this stunning resort earlier this year. Having just spent several weeks in Nusa Due and a few nights in Ubud, we found this property to amaze us at every turn.

We were greeted in the usual fashion for a hotel of this caliber. Welcome drink while seated in a quiet corner of the lobby. A member of the reception staff checked us in to our room and we were escorted to our suite overlooking the pool and beach. The room was flawless.

During our first night at the hotel, what hotel manager (Alain) was socializing with other guests who had gathered for casual evening cocktails. We also had the pleasure of chatting with their director of Sales and Marketing (Stephanie) what a delightful young woman. The next morning at the superbly appointed breakfast, we noticed Alain kindly and subtly chatting with fellow guests to ensure their stays were up to their expectations.

Our stay exceeded any expectations we could have imagined. While the hotel was opened in 1996, the property has been meticulously maintained and looked after. The craftsmanship of the hotel is timeless and the service is spot on to match.

Way to go Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
527,Landmark hotel in Seminyak,40,May 2018,"The Legian is a landmark hotel in Seminyak and a member of the Leading hotels of the World (LHW). Famous for its infinity pool and amazing sunset location our expectations were high. Days before our trip we were welcomed with a warm email, confirming our booking, and requesting whether we needed any transfer assistance or if we were celebrating a special occasion. Indeed, our trip was a birthday gift and the hotel was very helpful in making this a special moment.

We arrived late in the afternoon and the check-in was extremely friendly and quick. Eka (and later on Dewi) from reception assisted us during the check-in and during our stay. Both of them are really helpful and kind. After our check-in Eka showed us the hotel and guided us to our rooms, almost next to each other. The hotel decor is wonderful, long open corridors, magnificent ponds and overwhelming flower arrangements.

For this trip we booked two studio rooms and were granted two rooms on the top level. The view is magnificent, all rooms have ocean view. In my opinion the view at the top level of the hotel is the best.

Both rooms were spacious, well decorated and have a seating area on a terrace and furthermore on the adjacent terraces that connects with the bathroom, two sun beds. Eka gave an excellent tour and she informed us about room and its amenities. In the hallway there is a small kitchen area with a complementary minibar that is fully stocked and replenished once a day. Also, complimentary nuts, cassava chips and rosemary treats are available. Each room has a Nespresso coffee machine and a tea maker. Finally, let's not forget the complimentary Legian branded chocolate bars.

The room we stayed in had a kingsize bed, a separate lounge area and huge bathroom with both a rain shower and a bath tub. Amenities were by Acqua di parma. Also bath salt, candles and other amenities were available. This was great as well!

In the lounge area there is a TV, blue ray player, Bose sound system and a desk. We were welcomed with delicious bites from the restaurant. The hotel music, that is available to you via an iPod is very ""loungy"" and fits the room decor.

The room is cleaned once a day and there is a turn down service in the evening, when the room is refreshed and guests receive a small night snack. In the morning we received a complementary news paper. Also, there is a daily afternoon tea with snacks between 4 and 6 that is recommended to enjoy at the poolside during sunset. However, the hotel is happy to prepare the afternoon tea in your room.

Every morning there is a complimentary yoga class. We attended it twice, highly recommend. We did not use the gym, however we did take a tour of Spa where the gym is located. The pool is really magnificent with a first class seat during sunset. We also enjoyed the jazz band that was playing near the poolside.

Breakfast. Breakfast was included in our rate. On our way to the breakfast restaurant gamelan music welcomed us. The restaurant is both a la carte and buffet style with Indonesian and western delights. The staff is most friendly and provide a high level of service. We had an amazing breakfast here and the combination of a la carte and buffet breakfast is highly appreciated. The perfect service is extended to the pool area. Shade is created with umbrellas and cold towels are provided to refres as is iced water. Small snacks are also provided on a regular basis.

During our stay the staff engaged with us most sincerely, remembered and greeted us by our names and were willing to help us in every way (reservations for restaurants etc). We have sweet memories to that.

During our stay we received an invitation for a cocktail and canapés party with - apparently- guest that newly arrived at the hotel. The party was held opposite the hotel at the Legian Club area, where the villa's are located. We appreciated the invitation very much and the staff was very welcoming. The idea of a villa sounds appealing, however the villa's are not located on (or near) the beach. It is correctly advertised as a secluded section of the hotel. I would prefer a studio, with sea view.

The hotel is excellently located on the Seminyak beach and only minutes away from Seminyak square. Ku De Ta is next door, as is the famous Potato head. Plenty of excellent fine dining and boutique shops in the area that are worth visiting. The atmosphere is quite different from the Kuta (avoid) area. The only downside to this hotel is the location: heavy traffic. Traffic has gone worse on Bali in the last years and especially round dinner time the area is one big traffic jam. We usually took the shortcut to Seminyak square and took a taxi from there; if not the short stretch from the hotel to Seminyak square only could take half an hour or more. Taxis are cheap, but you don't want to waste your time. If you have time and patience, you can take a taxi from the hotel.

The only problem that we encountered with this hotel is the hotel security. We have stayed at numerous high end (leading) hotels in the world; also on Bali. But this was the first time that I sincerely felt somewhat discriminated. When we returned from a night out by taxi the hotel security did the usual security check: opening doors and the trunk to make sure you are no danger to the resort and the guests. This is quite common on Bali and highly appreciated in these changed times. However, every time (!) we returned to the hotel it was questioned by security if we were staying there. We were addressed in ""Bahasa"" based on -how I experienced it- our skin colour, not once but every-time we returned to the hotel that week. Where the wonderful hotel staff made an effort to memorize your name, it was apparently impossible for the hotel security to remember your face and if you were staying there. I have reported this to the resort manger and he informed us that security was tight and that security apparently rotates a lot. However, it was a very uncomfortable situation. After we addressed this to the resort manager, no more questions were asked until the last night. After a stroll through Seminyak we returned to the hotel and were stopped by security, again we were addressed in Bahasa in a unfriendly way (using the word ""dilarang""); Since I do not speak ""Bahasa"" I informed him in English that we were there all week. A smile appeared and we were allowed to enter. Again, I have never experienced this before and to me it is quite simple to change this unfriendly security protocol.

On our day of departure we checked out before noon and we were welcomed to use the hotel facilities and change/shower in a room that is available for one hour. This is highly appreciated; most high end hotels on Bali have a departure lounge/departure facilities.

We arranged the airport transfer ourselves, that was more convenient.

Will I stay here again? I am a fan of LHW (I am a Leaders Club Member) and visited and will visit Bali in future many more times. The hotel staff is wonderful, professional and truly excellent, but these ridiculous discriminating security measures will make me think twice before coming back to this property. However, if you have no colored skin it should be fine.

Overal I highly recommend this hotel, its services and location are just perfect. It is a pricy hotel, but it made our exceptions. Why not a five star rating? Basically the four star rating is based on my personal experiences with hotel security: Discrimination? who cares? I can imagine some people encounter this on a daily basis.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Each time I go it seems to get better, great layout with all the rooms, pool, restaurant and bar all overlooking the beach. The rooms are fantastic the food and service is exceptional. This is a very classy property and probably the best layout around. Highly recommend.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
530,Where Old Bali meets NEW,50,April 2018,"I must say, in all the years I have been going to Bali, I have lapped up the Villa Lifestyle (and still do). Don't get me wrong, I have also been fortunate enough to stay in some seriously great resorts, but I find that you never relax...the resorts are always ON...you feel you have to be on show, music pumping from the time your up your simply ON.

Enter The Legian Bali. For the first time ever we pulled in after a quick flight and immediately felt relaxed. The Legian is not a show pony venue, it is a classy venue with traditional Bali values at its core and truly deserves a Grand Luxury title.

Currently going through a refit (in a non obtrusive way), I just fell in love with the place and the staff who are super attentive, polite and make you feel like a super star, even when you have had far too many G&T's by the pool.

Don't take what I just said as ""This is a place full of loud obnoxious tourists""...it's not, The Legian has a way of subduing your soul, whilst still having a great but RELAXING time!
Part of this may be that the Legian is not the cheapest place on Legian beach, but nor should it be.

With 3 large pools (with beach front views), there are plenty of lounge beds and day beds to sit back, read a book, catch some sun, eat, enjoy a Cosmo or G&T (my wife and I could not resist) or simply just observe swimmers on the beach ignoring the safety signs (makes for some great commentary).

On the food front, WOW, the restaurant serves up amazing meals. Try the Lobster Curry, Mee Goreng, Calamari, Pork...you name it...give it a go!

Rooms are brilliant - we had a One Bedroom Deluxe suite. Quite, spacious, big bathroom and great views of that famous sunset.

Not Cheap, but would I stay again...Heck yeah!

Enjoy!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
531,Birthday Party,50,March 2018,"Stayed at the Beach House for my 70th Birthday, had 46 guests from Australia and New Zealand join us.,I had a vision of how I wanted everything to look with lighting flowers table settings fire dancers music fabulous food etc,thanks to the wonderful work of Lady Gwenne,Eddy and all the staff at The Legian my vision become 100% reality with all our guests commenting that it was the most stylish best party ever and one we will all never forget. The Legian Staff all made it so stress free and I had the best Birthday can’t thank you enough.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
532,The Club at the Legian - Stunning,50,April 2018,"WOW!! We had the most amazing stay for six nights. The private pool villas are stunning, the staff are amazing and cannot do enough to make your stay perfect. The setting is peaceful and tranquil, a few days here really recharges the batteries. This simply is one of the best Hotels we have stayed at anywhere, it is world class. A particular mention and thanks to the wonderful Honi, who made our stay even more memorable.

534,All around best resort I've stayed at,50,April 2018,"Unbelievable level of service at this boutique hotel, call us by our names from day one. Management often came by and asked how our stay was. Amazing food, amazing rooms with views. One of the few Bali hotels right on the ocean with the most amazing sunsets. 5 star hotel for sure!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
535,The Legian ..Great Spa and services but 'rules' not friendly.,20,April 2018,"Although highly recommended by colleagues in travel, we stayed elsewhere, deciding to pay the higher rates to attend the Day Spa, which was heavenly with wonderful, skilled and friendly staff. it was when we decided to linger a little longer, and have a drink, lunch and coffee that we were directed to the beach hut area, however were told as we were not guests, we could not sit on the lounge chairs, even though there were many available, but rather needed to sit at the coffee tables in the cafe. We explained that it seemed rather exclusive seeing that we had just been hotel clients in the Day Spa. we left feeling that this hotel was not as friendly as we had hoped but found Kim Soo acros the road and were more than satisfied with their service, sitting in a place of our choosing. will be passing this on to our travel agent friends!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
536,"very beautiful hotel, nice rooms, skilled and friendly staff",50,April 2018,"great room with pool and sea view - very confortable and sophisticated - high level of services. Excellent food at the restaurant facing the sea. So a real good experience. They also suggest me to buy a ""VIP pass"" at the airport : lines for immigration can sometimes be very long (over 1 hour) and the Denpasar airport need an upgrade : be bigger as the passengers are more and more numerous, more counters and more belts for luggages.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
537,Best place to watch the sunset,50,April 2018,"We were looking for a place with a. Beautiful drink to go and have a cocktail without the nightclub thing going on. Front he moment we arrived, greeted by lovely concierge and advised them we wanted a drink at the bar. Went to a poolside bar, overlooking the beach and infinity pools. Service was exceptional - it’s just the attention to detail that this place does so well (and weren’t event staying here!).
Although drinks are pricey, they come with a view, cashew nuts and cute little cheese sticks (complimentary) and they do great bar snacks (try the vege spring rolls - they are sensational)
The lovely bar staff took our picture, were attentive with our intrusive and all in all it was 5* luxury at its best. This place is certainly a gorgeous hotel - we’re booking into stay next time we’re in Bali, purely because we were treated so very special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
538,Amazing Visit at this Property,50,April 2018,"We were referred by some colleagues to this property and initially I wasn't sure I loved it. That changed with amazing service, delicious food and a staff that went beyond my expectations. The property is beautiful and service is excellent . My review however is based on how the hotel helped in a serious medical emergency. My friend collapsed in Ubud and the hotel concierge helped us in getting an ambulance and Dr. at the property when we returned. The medical team stayed most of the afternoon and may have just saved my friends life. Thanks to the amazing concierge team and the management. You were awesome.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
539,"Wonderful Stay, Great Service!",50,April 2018,"We had a lovely three night stay at The Legian in Seminyak - truly a boutique hotel with personalized service - where all the staff knew us by our names and it felt like being home.

The set of infinity pools overlooking the ocean had amazing sunset views. Service was pre anticipative with everything you need arriving before you ask. Tea at the poolside was great. Children felt comfortable and welcome.

The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Staff were caring, polite and courteous. They went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of. Well deserving of a special mention - Eka - who really made our stay very special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
540,Good / Bad,40,March 2018,"The legian Hhotel is excellent! Definetly 5 star. However, the beach and Bali beaches in general have become garbage dumps. Whether third world country attitudes, culture, or poor disposal systems, the beaches and coasts are littered wiht trash.

I wnet swimming in the ocean and intially thought I was surrounded by seaweed. On closer inspection, it was trash. It's unavoidable. I do not hold this agasint the Legian. Thier property, rooms, swimming pools are spectacular. Just don't go in the ocean.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
541,Simply amazing!!!,50,April 2018,"I just spent an amazing week at the Legian staying in a one bedroom deluxe suite and all of the outstanding reviews that the hotel has received are well worth it.

The suite was presented beautifully, very spacious and a lovely outlook over the gardens, the pool and the ocean in the background. As it was built in 1996 the rooms do lack in the area of technology, but speaking with the most hard working manager Hans, he agreed with my feedback and is in the process of addressing the various technology shortcomings. Management here appears to be very proactive and receptive to customer feedback, perhaps other businesses could take note of this positive management trait.

The breakfasts were amazing, and included in my room rate. You can choose to have breakfast in your room or in the restaurant. I chose the restaurant as it has the most amazing aspect overlooking the 3 infinity pools and the ocean beyond.

The facilities were outstanding. The swimming pools were a delight to simply soak in and watch the waves roll in. There was a slight issue with one of the pools, but again management got onto it straight away, acknowledging the issue and resolving it within 24 hours. Again, other businesses could take note of the way The Legian does things.

The staff were faultless, always addressing you by your name and adjusting your towels on your sun lounges every time you left your lounge to go for a swim. Iced water is topped up frequently, ensuring that you always have a cold water to sip on as required. The staff make this resort and appear to take pride in working there.

Hans (Manager) was ever so nice providing assistance in planning a trip to The Legian for my elderly parents this time next year. I have no doubt that they will go above and beyond to make sure that this trip is amazing and I only wish we could make this happen sooner rather than later.

My only one gripe, people smoking around the pool. Coming from Australia, this is not something that we are used to any more. Perhaps the hotel might consider a smoking section.

Having said that, I cannot recommend The Legian enough, a truly deserving member of the Leading Hotels of the Word.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
542,Just Wow!!,50,April 2018,"We are staying here at the moment. It's SO good there's just no need to wait to review the hotel until we leave. We have stayed in some lovely hotels with great service but this is just something else. It's smaller than I had realised but that adds to its charm. The 2-bed apartment. Beautiful and beautifully maintained. Housekeeping are amazing. Front desk and check-in are so friendly, so accommodating. We asked for red dragon fruit as it's almost impossible to get in Perth. It appeared in the fruit bowl in our room and at breakfast for my daughter within 20 minutes - they went to fetch some fresh. Breakfast - amazing view, top service. No hurry. Elegant. Cold room for cheers and meats, everything top quality. First hotel where we have felt truly spoiled at breakfast. We've been impressed before by the volume of choice and staff friendliness. This is different.
The only way we could think to describe it is The W in Seminyak (we loved it last time in Bali) is like a ""new money"" 5 star. Luxury but lets you know. This is ""old money"" understated elegance. The infinity pool is divine. At night this place is glorious.
Well done all at The Legian. No-one and nothing lets you down.
We will be back. Can't recommend it enough.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
543,Just a brilliant place to stay!,50,April 2018,"We have stayed at the Legian (the one at Seminyak, not Legian Beach) a couple of times and have always rated it highly but, if anything, found it even better this time. We stayed in a Studio Suite with an ocean view and it was beautifully appointed and spacious with 2 balconies overlooking the grounds and the ocean. The great things about this place are the staff and quality of service which were uniformly of the highest standard. Everything runs like clockwork (to be expected given the Swiss management!) but most of all the staff are always smiling and courteous, something we don't see enough of in Australia. Alain and his management team deserve a great deal of credit for the very positive culture at this establishment.
Breakfast is brilliant with a wide range of choice but we also found lunch and dinner of a high standard, if a little pricey (but then this isn't a down-market place).
One of the great attractions for us is the fact that you can always get a sun lounge under shade, whether from the palms or with the help of the ever-willing staff who are more than happy to move the umbrellas around as the day proceeds. The new infinity pools are beautiful, providing the opportunity to laze around and look out over the ocean.
The Legian is also well positioned with respect to the great array of restaurants in Seminyak with a lot within easy walking distance and others only a short taxi ride away.
The Legian is not the cheapest place to stay but in our view is worth every dollar. We will certainly be returning.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
544,Pure luxury,50,April 2018,"stunning hotel.
serious attention to detail.
we stayed 6 nights, and were blown away by how fabulous it was, from the different nightly messages on the bed at night to the daily catch up with the manager at breakfast. Hightlights: Daily afternoon tea by the pool, everyone knows your name, on the house massage, well stocked room.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
545,Exceptional service,50,February 2018,"Me and my mum had the pleasure to stay at The Legian Bali in one of the Club Villas. Not only was the villa, the club, the pool and surroundings absolutely beautiful clean and green, the best part was the actual service of The Club. Thanks to our personal butler Purna, we had the most amazing experience. He was always available, constantly in a good mood, talkative and genuine (plus his English was incredible). We truly couldn't be more satisfied! We can't wait to come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
546,Again extremly enjoyable,50,March 2018,"We have been a few time at a Club Pool Villa already and we are actually planning a vacation in autumn. It would not surprise me if The Legian will see us again as we have severe problems to find something comparable as far as atmosphere, service and
privacy is concerned. Also the new (at least for us) manager Alain Eggenschwiler gives you the feeling that you are back home again. I think more must hardly be said about this lovely place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
547,Outstanding,50,April 2018,Well this is our 35th anniversary last stop. The Legian has truly exceeded all of our expectations. The management the staff the hotel is exceptional beyond belief. We would like to thank everyone from the cleaners to the highest level in the hotel including Hans😃seriously you have all been amazing. We will be really sad to leave on Thursday. Our massages today were out of this world and would recommend them to everyone. Thank you everyone from the bottom of our hearts for a truly amazing stay love you guys x,The Legian Seminyak Bali
548,Wanted to give 5 stars but we had a few issues!,40,March 2018,"We arrived at The Legian Bali for 3 nights, check in felt a bit impersonal and then when we got there at 2pm we were told our room was not ready and to wait by the pool where we were asked multiple times who we were and what our room number was which I wasn’t sure of because we hadn’t been told. Therefore I felt like we were treated as people sneaking into the hotel. I understand check in is normally not until 3pm but I had communicated through the website I booked though that we would arrive prior to 2pm. At 3pm our room was ready and we were escorted to the room, however after specifically pre booking a ‘quiet room’ we were placed in a room at the side of the property next to the construction of the hotel next door’s pool. I tried to ignore the sounds but you could hear the drilling even with all doors shut and with music playing. The room however is lovely, older style but still classic.
I had stayed at this hotel approximately 10 years prior and had really fond memories, therefore I reluctantly decided to mention the construction noise to reception. After a couple hours they got back to me that they would be able to move us (and upgrade) which was really nice however I feel like they only did that after they made the realisation that I had stayed before.
The upgraded room was lovely, very spacious and luxurious. Would maybe have expected a few more bathroom amenities I.e tooth brush or razor. We did ring room service for a razor but it didn’t arrive.
On our last night before our international flight home there was a private party until 11pm which was nicely communicated to us days before however there was still loud music playing at 11.30pm and I called reception and they didn’t seem to know what I was talking about. Thankfully the music was turned down around 11.45pm-12am.
A lot of these issues were made to seem minor due to the nice staff, lovely hotel grounds and facilities. I suppose I just expected a little bit more and had higher expectations since my previous stay! I would still return to The Legian Bali, I just think a few little things could be improved to make the experience a little less disappointing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
549,A Serene Sanctuary Home,50,February 2018,"I booked a room in The Legian Hotel Bali, as I found out trough some travel websites that this gorgeous hotel has an excellent reviews and has been high rated in the top position. When I checked in, they gave me a delicious traditional Balinese welcome drink, and they welcomed me with the very heart-warming hospitality, so much care and treat me like I am visiting one of my family's home. They gave me a complimentary room upgrade (subject to availability upon arrival, but they are very keen to give their best to the guests), I've got to stay in a spacious suite (± 110 sqm) with my own large sea view balcony equipped with a huge daybed that decorated beautifully with some pillows and a pretty chandelier, a large terrace in the other side of my suite, a massive comfortable king-size bed protected by a luxury mosquito net, a nice big bathroom with luxury bathroom amenities and spacious high quality bath tub (a gorgeous shower room, super clean toilet, and three-door closet also make it more royal) . I had my own living room equipped with big sofa, beautiful desk, stationery, books and magazines (a daily newspaper is also delivered to the room every morning). There is a large smart LED TV integrated with blue-ray DVD player, music player and super cool bose lifestyle entertainment sound systems, and complementary super fast WiFi access. I've got my own dining area with round dining table decorated with some real fruits and beautiful flowers. The complementary minibar equipped with espresso machine and tea-making facilities, delicious snacks, selection drinks in the fridge (free and replenished every day). In my check-in time, one of the concierges ""Pak Hendra"" allowed me to have a sit and do the checkin n a very relaxing way and he handle it professionally. He is willingly showed me around to every single spot and all facilities available in the hotel and explained all the details. The hotel provides a complementary tea-time between 4 to 6 pm everyday in the beautiful beach-front gazebo next to the gorgeous swimming pool and all the guests can have it in there or inside their own suite. Unfortunately, I was in a late check-in, I arrived at 9 pm and I ask for a substitution of it in my suite, and guess what? The chef delivers some sweet and beautiful chocolates into my suite and apologies that I couldn't get the tea-time snacks (he even doesn't have to do it, it was my fault actually who came very late for chek-in, but he did it and it made my stay even feel nicer). As I arrived in my suite, all of my bags are already stored neatly in my suite,  Pak Hendra explained every single details of the suite facilities, with a nice manner he ask me whether there is something else that I need to ask and clarify or not, and after that he allowed me to enjoy my rest and he greet me again wishing me a pleasant stay in the hotel. I just spent an hour in the hotel but I was so overjoyed with it's incredible hospitality. My night was so tranquil, I had a peaceful deep sleep. In the morning, I had a luxury healthy breakfast in my own sea view balcony, a perfect sunrise colaborate with clear fresh air and beautiful sound of the sea waves echoing adding pleasure to my breakfast (this is probably the feeling of breakfast at ""Nirvana""). Not enough with that, after finished my delightful breakfast, I joined a peaceful morning yoga session in the hotel's sea view health club, and then I jumped to the three-layers beachfront infinity swimming pool, it really made my morning so exquisite. After finished with my swimming, I went to the sea view restaurant, located just behind the swimming pool, and had my brunch. One of the waitresses, ""Ibu Dayu"" welcome me so sweetly and allowed me to choose my own table, she explained all the gorgeous foods available in the menu and in the buffet area, the brunch served in a fine dining setting, I had a soft spinach and mushroom omelette, organic selection of seasonal fresh fruits, healthy tasty fresh vegetable and fruit juices, perfectly ended by a mouth-watering organic coconut ice cream as my desert, it was one of the exceptional and finest brunch I've ever had. After I finished it, Ibu Dayu offered me the best selection of tea available in the hotel and offered me a selection of newspapers. She even nicely offered me the other selection of beverages available including other healthy juices. She had some nice chat with me during my brunch, oh my God she is such a generous wise lady with a really tender heart and she is very sincere in doing her job (I believe all the people who work in this hotel have the same attitude, as I previously mentioned some of them). After being lost in a delightful unforgettable brunch session, i decided to explore more of the Hotel's accommodations and facilities. I've read that the Hotel has other luxurious exceptional accommodations called ""The Beach House"" and ""The Club Villas"", so I went to the concierge and ask for a Hotel tour. One of the concierges ""Mbak Eka"" was so happy to guided me and showed me around. She first escorted me to The Beach House, a unique and luxurious beach front three-bedroom villa located in the right side of the hotel. It has everything that provided in the suite, plus the extra facilities that only available in this one-of-a kind villa, such as a private infinity edge pool in the Seminyak beach facing the sea, gazebo. I am so in love with this magnificent villa and hope someday I can have my private celebration moment here. After that, we're heading to the Club Villas located across the Hotel. Nestled in the middle of seminyak area, these 14 villas are exclusively designed for an ultimate privacy compound with private pool, private lounge, highly trained personal butlers. All its facilities are thoughtfully designed to exceed luxury retreat. My eyes, my heary and my mind are blown away by this magnificent venue. 

Time flies so fast, it was noon and almost close to lunch time, I even still so full and not hungry, and it is also close to the checkout time. I went to the reception and ask for the late checkout, as my flight schedule back to Jakarta will depart at 8 pm. They absolutely allowed me to have the late checkout and not just enough in there, surprisingly, they registered me in a ""hospitality suite"". In my first thought the hospitality suite would be like a lounge with some light refreshment, but then as I stepped in to the hospitality suite in The Legian Hotel, it is literally a suite complete with the exact amenities and facilities I have in my suite. Yes, it is a fully equipped suite, that I can take a nap on the king size bed, have a shower, have lunch, enjoy watching TV and movies, listen to some music. It is exactly like I have a second proper check-in at the Hotel. Oh my God, i was so thrilled and extremely grateful with the exceptional excellent services I experienced in this serene sanctuary property. It took me back to the reviews I have read before I did my reservation of the hotel. What they said about the Legian Hotel is undoubtedly truth. It wasn't exaggerated, in fact, as I proved it myself by staying in the Hotel, I've got more than a joyful experience. 

I will definitely come back. The Legian Hotel is serene sanctuary and it is a ""home"" full of sincere hospitality galore. The beautiful sunset combined with the Heartwarming hospitality of the The Legian Hotel's team who deliver the exceptional services and experiences. Such a perfect home for everyone. Thank you very much.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
550,Definite recommendation,50,March 2018,"Everything about this property is simply wonderful: we stayed in one of the 14 villas at the Club, 400 m2 of pure pleasure and luxury, the gentle and candidly nice service, the well equipped Pool-Villa, the big gym, the spa, the nice restaurant, the 3 pools by the sea: An oasis of friendliness and relaxation, a definite come back soon again and stay longer next time.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

552,A Dream Stay in Seminyak,50,February 2018,"Staying at The Legian Bali was an absolutely wonderful experience. It stands out as one of the most beautiful hotels I've ever been to, with the most fantastic, attentive and dedicated staff.

The room was a level above anywhere we've ever stayed before. We have stayed at many five star hotels, but nowhere quite like this. The suite was large, and lavish, with beautiful decor and everything you can think of provided, and more. The bedroom was so beautiful with a white net curtain and four poster bed, a large ensuite with his and her sinks and a big bathtub.

The terrace looking out over Seminyak beach was a dream come true. I spent every night with my husband there sipping a glass of wine on the day bed, listening to the sound of the waves. Such an amazing experience! I was also lucky enough to catch a couple of beautiful sunsets during my stay as well!

Now, to talk about the staff. Its the first place I ever stayed where the guests greeted us every single day by our names. For quite a large hotel, I think that is absolutely incredible! How they manage to do this, I have no idea. It really next level service. The staff were very attentive, from laying out the sunbeds for you and coming frequently to refresh your drink, to their amazing breakfast and afternoon tea.

They are quite generous in their offering too, including the complimentary afternoon tea, and a well stocked minibar of chocolate, beer, soft drinks, sparkling water etc. They even have a nespresso machine in the room, with cookies and snacks to go with.

We had a bit of an accident with our camera when we were there and broke a lens. The concierge completely sorted us out. Called the sony centre, arranged a taxi and agreed the price all in advance. If it weren't for him, losing the camera would have really spoiled the last part of our holiday.

I highly recommend The Legian for your stay in Seminyak. I certainly can't wait to return. Thank you to all the staff for the incredible service.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
553,The very best hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2018,"I am so glad I booked The Legian Hotel and not any other hotel in the area as the experience has been great!

Everyone in the hotel was so lovely and made me feel very welcome.\\

Having their complimentary afternoon tea by the pool/beach was a beautiful experience as well.

I will definitely come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
554,A true sample of excellent hospitality!,50,February 2018,"Over the last couple of months I stayed twice at The Legian Bali. Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I've ever stayed. They will make you feel like home from the moment you enter the resort. The friendly staff, the excellent food, the beautiful surroundings. Words can't describe how great to over-all experience is.

They set the bar for any 5 star luxury resort. Cant wait wait to be back soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
555,Beautiful and relaxing.,50,October 2017,Enjoyed our private time together at The Legian before going to a meeting at a villa. The staff was fabulous...we will return! Great shopping and restaurants nearby...and beautifully appointed rooms. THe spa was wonderful too!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
556,Luxurious stay at The Legian!,50,February 2018,"We were on our honeymoon trip to Bali, and stayed at The Legian for two nights. This was definitely one of the most luxurious and memorable stays for us. The Legian impressed us by their great hospitality, professionalism, care of their guests, location and last but not the least their great f&b spread. We stayed in the spacious and luxurious Deluxe Suite. It featured spacious living room with Bose multiroom audio system, fully equipped kitchen, large bed room with a king size bed, and and open sit out balcony with a great view of the ocean. Our room was located steps away from the beach, and made for a great way to start and end our days with a beach walk. We had a great stay at The Legian, and would love to go back during our next trip to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
557,Incredible Hotel & Unparalleled Service,50,February 2018,"The team at the Legian Bali really know and strive to create truly memorable customer experiences. We stayed in a one bedroom Villa Room at “The Club” for 7 nights and from the moment we arrived we were simply taken care of. It’s the first holiday we’ve ever had where we never actually left the hotel. We had the fortune of having a butler service for our room and I can’t speak more highly of our Butler Diki. He created an experience that was bespoke to us, he was always there when you needed him, was one step ahead in anticipating your needs and was great to talk to and get to know.

The whole experience including the food quality, hotel and The Club facilities, pools etc were all top standard but what truly sets it apart is the passionate team who strive to make your stay personal and one you’ll always remember.

I can’t recommend highly enough and below are some pictures of our Villa and the hotel. Can’t wait to go back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

559,They know true HOSPITALITY,50,February 2018,"Under the great leadership of the GM Hans, these folks know the true meaning of hospitality. There are complementary mini-bar beverages & snacks in your fridge. Free tea time with small cakes in the afternoon. These are inexpensive things, but it makes your stay that much more comfortable & show case the true Balinese hospitality. The service staff is 1st class, they will go out of their way to satisfy your reasonable requests or any questions you might have. They make you feel like a VIP.

The breakfast buffet selection is smaller than most hotels, but the quality is what is counts. The dishes are tasty and not greasy.

The stuff at the Spa is also very skillful & well train.

Overall, is a wonderful place for a memorable & satisfying stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
560,High quality,50,January 2018,"Quality service is the highlight of the stay for us. There was a warm welcome with comprehensive info being shared about our suite and the facilities. There is also luxurious spa for those interested. The bed is firm & the pillows are perfect. The breakfast buffet includes everything you could ever want, and a menu too",The Legian Seminyak Bali
561,It works 100% on all levels,50,February 2018,"Just checked out today from The Legian following five nights in room 224 with my family. It was a second to none experience with attentive members of staff catering to our every need. Everyone from the managing director to the lifeguard on duty did an effort in making us feel at home and we were all impressed with the level of service, the quality of food, the facilities (specially the gym had the most impressive lineup one can ever wish for) and last but not least with the way in which they helped handle a challenge that happened when I needed to change money! Here it comes - WARNING. Do NOT use the several small exchange outlets along the main roads of Seminyak no matter how good a rate they offer. They are able to remove a third of the bills like magic without you even getting close to noticing anything before you get home and realize you just made the worst mistake. I literally freaked and ran down to get some help from staff who jumped in a hotel car and drove me back to the outlet where they helped sort things out. I got my EURO back. Thats the kind of service one can expect from the staff at The Legian. They are there for you even when it's not really their job.
I'm very impressed with the way this hotel makes it all run smoothly at all levels. Not often does Ione experience that.
Is it expensive? YES. Is it worth it? YES - every penny.
The location is also part of the attraction as you are able to walk to pretty m much every good restaurant in Seminyak from there.
We'll be back again.
Thanks for making it a memorable stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
562,Great place. First call in Bali for authentic service,50,February 2018,"We love the Legian. I have stayed there several times over the last 15 years and it is always a joy to return.
This time I brought 2 friends who had always been wary of coming to Bali. They were so
Impressed by the hotel and staff that are encouraging their husbands to come next time.
We loved the yoga with Pudra at a sensible 8 am start and Hans and his team have the place running like clockwork. They remembered names and drink orders without needing to ask each day.
Attention to detail was exceptional and the staff were caring and delightful.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
563,Great stay in a villa,50,January 2018,"We stayed at The Legian for a week in a one bed pool villa at the club and had a very pleasant relaxed time.
The villas are spacious and well laid out in a Balinese style. Walled and gated with your own pool and garden so very self contained. The roof of the villa extends a long way from the villa walls so on every side you had shade if you wanted it, great for me as I shy away from the sun. My wife however is a sun worshiper so she made use of the loungers in the garden that were in the sun all day long. There is a butler that looks after you all day. They are not shared with others but dedicated to you for you stay. We were lucky to have a lovely lady called Honi look after us and that she did. Honi took care of washing and ironing (included in the price)and everything to do with the room. Also made sure she was there when we were in the restaurants to look after us. It’s not one of the cheapest options to stay at but the little extras included in the price help to add value. I.E Afternoon tea for two hours 4-6 followed by happy hour 6-8 with all drinks and canapes included in the price. The mini bar in the room along with 3 bottles of spirits, jars of snacks and cookies, tea and coffee all included in the price. Breakfast is excellent both at the club and at the main hotel just over the road so looked forward to that each morning after using the gym at the hotel for an hour. The gym is a decent size for a hotel with I’m sure enough varied equipment to suit all tastes. They just need to make sure the aircon is turned down as it was a bit on the warm side for us. You don’t have to worry about crossing the road from the club to the hotel as the security guards walk into the road and stop the traffic for you. As well as your own pool in the villa there were also pools at the hotel and at the club. At the club there is a lovely 35 meter (I think) pool that every time my wife used it she was the only one there. She loved it. If you want to get out and about in Seminyak the hotel will drive you and pick you up when you want, all part of the price. You can easily walk into town to all the bars and restaurants. Takes about 5 mins to walk to the flea market and that’s the start of the main drag on that side of town. The resort and the lovely people who work there are very focused on making sure you have a great time including all the management and the new resort manager Alain who all stop to say hello, even welcoming you to the resort and waving you off. A nice touch that many top class resorts fail in but not The Legian. It’s a great place to be on holiday and I’m sure Alain will put even more polish on the resort. Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
564,Excellent hotel - one of the best I have stayed in around the world,50,December 2017,"We stayed in a villa at The Club, the villa was really spacious and well laid out. My wife loved the outdoor huge bath tub and private pool.

Our butler Diki was so friendly and helpful and did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable, Diki realised we liked the local exotic fruit and everyday in addition to our standard fruit bowl, we would find rambutans, longans and mangosteens in our room, thank you so much Diki!

We used the spa and the service was excellent. Aside from the private pool in our villa I enjoyed using The Club pool as it was so quiet compared to the main pool.

The food at the restaurant was excellent with a good selection of wine and a very helpful sommelier.

The complementary hotel transport was a seamless service, having the car outside our villa gate whenever we requested it was fantastic.

Its hard to find any fault with The Legian, the only two very minor things I would say is that the coffee at the main hotel was not as good as the coffee at The Club and some of the hotel vehicles are not branded so it was sometimes difficult to identify the hotel cars when collected from outside the hotel although the drivers were very good at recognising us.

My wife didn't want to leave, we hope to be back one day soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
565,Spectacular Hotel,50,July 2017,"We stayed at the Legian for 5 nights during our honeymoon in Bali and can not speak highly enough of this hotel. Superb location, access to a beautiful beach and the best sunsets in Bali. The staff are extremely helpful and will go out of their way to make you feel at home. Food is delicious and their attention to detail is brilliant, I particularly loved the personalized bookmarks which they left on our bed every night. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly releasing baby turtles back in to the sea, organized by the hotel and such a truly special experience. Will hope to visit the Legian again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
566,Bliss,50,December 2017,"My wife and I have been traveling as a couple to Bali every six months for the past few years to take a relaxing break. This was our second stay at The Legian. They made sure we had the same villa and staff to add to the home away from home feel. It was just as wow as the first visit. From our private garden it felt like no one else was around. When we ventured out we felt like we were their only guests. You can go down the pampering or privacy path whenever it takes your fancy. Either way, your troubles and concerns will just melt away. Two things made this holiday stand out in comparison with other villas. First, our personal Butler Yoni was so delightful. Second, our villa and garden were amazing due to the inviting Indonesian décor in a functionally modern layout. Tim the manager went above and beyond the call of duty. We can see why some of the staff have been working at The Legian for 20 years. We highly recommend The Legian and can't wait to return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
567,The best hotel we have been to in Bali,50,January 2018,"We stayed here for a week after a long trip abroad with our three kids (4, 2, 0.5yo), staying in one of the two bedroom suites and it was brilliant. I can honestly say the staff are some of the most attentive and courteous we have ever come across. Nearly all of them knew our names, walking around the hotel and often wished us a good morning, afternoon or evening. Lovely!
The room was superb; our kids loved it. Separate air con for each room and the living room. Massive bathroom for main bedroom and huge bathroom for second room. Small pantry area for mini-bar (all free) including daily stocked up fruit platter and a Nespresso coffee machine. Not once did we ever have to call to ask for anything, it was all there. Our baby even got a little welcome pack of goodies which itself was very helpful.
The food in the restaurant was great and we partook in the daily afternoon tea and the once-weekly manager's cocktail reception.
We had a massage in the spa and it was bliss - a couples' massage with facial. Perfect location and staff!

I can't recommend this hotel more highly for families and for couples. It's a superb spot in Seminyak and has everything you could possibly want. We will be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
568,Truly fantastic!,50,January 2018,"We are fussy but we could not fault this hotel. It was pricey but you really got what you paid for.

Outstanding staff - while we found staff everywhere in Bali excellent these guys stood out as being helpful.

Our room was great - with a huge balcony, daybed and table where we could have breakfast served.

We really could not fault this hotel - also in easy walking distance of other restuarants along the beach.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
569,Just stunning,50,January 2018,"This is truly one of the best hotels you're ever going to stay in. It is just stunning. From the grand entrance, the 5 star service from every member of staff, to the most beautiful infinity pools. The main entrance out to the ocean reveals 3 pools on 3 levels which are not only good swimming pools (2 of three) but are really dramatically eye-pleasing. The grass is manicured to the nth degree. The spa is lovely (though the jacuzzis take a bit of mastering) and the gym equipment is very modern but a little limited. In a hotel of this magnitude it would justify a larger gym complex. The bedrooms (we had a deluxe ocean view double) are really lovely with terrific bathrooms. Food was exceptional. It's really very difficult to come up with a criticism - even the location - Bodyworks Spa is 5 mins walking distance and the treatments there are exceptional and a third of the price of the hotel spa. La Lucciola restaurant is walking distance and was expensive but incredible and for a great vibe go to Ku de Ta - ocean bar again walking distance. I wouldn't hesitate to return to this truly memorable hotel - probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
570,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!!!",50,January 2018,"This hotel is by far one of the best we have ever stayed in. We stayed in one of the villas and we couldn't have asked for anything better. The staff were so friendly, happy and the service was impeccable. If you ever stay in the villas I would recommend requesting ""Agus"" as your butler- words can't describe how amazing he is! We had a wonderful holiday here and will definately be going back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
571,Superb,50,October 2017,"Great location, and a stunning hotel. Not cheap but with great service, great food and plenty of ‘freebies’ both in and out of the room - it is therefore worth he prices. Pool stunning. Short walk into town and some excellent restaurants close by. Two grumbles, bedsheets damp towards the end of each day (sea view room I suppose) and no hot water for first day. Otherwise brilliant.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
572,Great place to stay,50,January 2018,"Amazing service, rooms, quality and amenities. We stayed for 3 nights after having stayed in the W hotel and the Bulgari and had an amazing time at the Legian.

The rooms are very well sized and have great views. We were in a ground floor villa with our own access to the beach.

The breakfasts are great - lots of selection and very good quality. The mini bars are all complimentary (i.e. included in the room rate) which is a nice touch.

The gym is well equipped for a hotel gym. There are also complimentary yoga classes every morning.

I would definitely go back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
573,Great fine dining in Seminyak,40,January 2018,"We went to the Legian on my wife’s birthday including our teenage daughters. 2 of us is gluten intolerant so we always appreciate when they know what they are doing.

The Restaurant has very high ( Michelin star) ambition and therefore our expectations were set on that level.

The service was attentive and swift throughout the Tasting menu experience! The sommelier was engaging and very professional. According to expectations in this type of restaurant. It was great to discuss how the sommelier community is developing in Bali.

The menu Evolve consisted in 8 dishes and corresponding wine package. They made adaptations to provide gluten-free alternatives when needed.

Our general opinion is that this was a traditional fine dining experience. Really good and tasty. Impeccable service but maybe not innovative and experimental dishes. All where on the safe side. The location of the restaurant is perfect!!!

The first course was a crab dish on a green papadum like cracker- delicious and well balanced

The second course was a small poke bowl inspired dish with some raw fish ( I think) - really tasty

The 3 rd dish was a snapper bite- also really tasty-maybe not innovative

The 4 th was a bite of Barramundi with pumpkin and shrimp- god but rich. Here we started to get a bit full

The 5 th was a duck liver breaded with a concentrated truffle sauce - really good but the plates should have been heated to improve the texture of the sauce. I loved it but the girls were affected by this.

The 6 th dish was a Wagyo beef bite. Fantastic! But by now we were all too full to appreciate the taste fully.

The 7th dish was a berry foam. Perfectly located in the menu! We regained some ability to eat the final dish

The 8 th dish was a coffe panacotta with a great sorbet layer at the top. Great taste but the presentation could have improved.

Wa have during our vacation here in Bali eaten at several of the fine dining restaurants and here’s our list

1) Bikini- most innovative- Brilliant!
2)The Legian- traditional fine dining
3) Boys N Cow - best meat!
4) Ku de ta- great poolside lunch",The Legian Seminyak Bali
574,Hands Down One of the Best Hotels I have Ever Stayed at,50,December 2017,"I am not sure where to begin. This is one of the best resorts I have ever stayed at. The Legian Bali has end to end great service, a phenomenal restaurant; and an exceptional tri-level infinity pool that is waterfront.
This hotel is truly a testament to the Leading Hotels of the World Group. Every single detail has been thought of.
All suites in this hotel have ocean views. Despite being a small hotel, it still has all of the creature comforts of a large hotel; with late check in and 24 hour room service available.
Breakfast was delivered to our room daily; which was a real treat. Staff always enter your room after removing their shoes; which really adds a homely and traditional Balinese element to the stay. Furthermore, the concierge has a list of great dining options in Seminyak which did not disappoint. However for fine dining, you cannot go past the Restaurant at the Legian. We dined in the restaurant at the hotel for 3 dinners because it was such a fantastic experience; great food with an exceptional view to match.
Unfortunately, it was raining for many days while we were at this hotel, so we were unable to book a private dining experience at the beach.
Other than that; everything about this hotel was truly outstanding. The hotel invites guests to a cocktail function every Thursday, which is a really good way to get to know other guests at the resort.
The hotel amenities were all Acqua di Parma; which was luxurious touch. It was the little things about this hotel that made it truly exceptional; the fact that small packets of fish food were available to feed fish in the pond; the fact that hotel staff knew our names and our daily schedule/ routine; and even the fact that there were giant water bowls to wash our feat when returning to the resort from the beach.
The cocktails at the bar were truly exceptional (I recommend the Berry Jane); as was the bar food (I recommend the tuna satay skewers).
The tri-level infinity pool is something special; and the staff went out of their way to ensure that we were comfortable (often adjusting the pool-side umbrellas to ensure that we were in the shade).
Despite being an expensive resort, I believe The Legian Bali represents exceptional value for money. The Legian Bali truly offers next level service; and I would not hesitate to stay there again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
575,Excellent with one exception,50,December 2017,"The Legian is a beautiful hotel and the staff are amongst the best we have experienced in 30+ years of travelling the world. They could not do enough to ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Typical Bali hospitality. The food was excellent and all the facilities are clean and well maintained.

The one exception was was not entirely the hotel's fault. There were a couple of guests that behaved very badly and were not pulled into line. Their behaviour caused safety concerns and made it uncomfortable for guests. I am sure the hotel will learn from that experience. The Legian is such a beautiful, peaceful Hotel it does not need to tolerate that type of guest.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
576,"Great service, great food, great accomodation",50,December 2017,"Stayed with wife and daughter in One bedroom Villa in the Club for two weeks over Christmas. I slept on sofa in the Living room. Everything was great. First few days we had dinners at the hotel with great view of the breaking waves. After that we decided to have breakfasts and dinners deliered to our villa by Bono, our butler. The food variety on menu wasn´t too wide. But whatever we chose was excellent. Every single time. Bono arranged bigger scooter for us (hotel has smaller Vespas to rent) - ideal to ride around Seminyak (we did ride all three on one scooter as it is common. Recommend wearing a helmet if you are going further from the hotel towards Kuta, since the police like to stop unhelmetted foreigners and ask for money - it did happen to me...). I do not recommend renting a car, it is challenging and slow with scooters everywhere... Hotel provides massages, pedicure and other treatments. Really very nice. If you walk around Legian, you will run into these everywhere on the street and it is cheaper with good quality. Hotel has nice swimming pools. Villas have nice swimming pools. Swimming pool at the Club is amazing. It must be at least 25m long. Never seen anyone else there. We always had it to ourselves when we came to swim. If I should menton one trouble - in the ponds with fish next to all villas, there are occasionally frogs. And the frogs make a lot of noise at night. I was going to sleep ussualy at 2-3 AM, so it was easy for me to call housekeeping in the middle of the night, they would come and catch the frog(s) and take them away. They caught the frog(s) every time. Just don´t be afraid to call. The Club is across the street from the hotel. Club is completely self-sufficient, you do not need to go to the hotel for anything - unless you want to go to the beach. There is a shack with surfboards to rent on the beach just in front of the hotel. Plenty of sunbeds next to pools in front of the hotel. Good snacks delivered anytime during the day. Famous restaurant/bar KUDETA is some 200m from the hotel - that is a must-go place! We stayed in the ""W"" hotel two years ago, also in a villa with pool. W´s ultra modern design is superior to the one of Legian´s. Legian´s ultra-attentive attitude proved a better choice for us in the end. I would recomend Legian Bali hotel to anyone! Vita",The Legian Seminyak Bali
577,"Beautiful resort, excellent servuxe",50,December 2017,"We stayed here recently for our anniversary in a 1 bed villa and we had an amazing time. Our butler Agus was very friendly and helpful, never intrusive but highly attentive. I wish we could have stayed longer

Only downside I would say is the massage we had in the hotel. It was great however from research and talking to others I would go elsewhere as you will pay 30-40% of the price you do here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
578,Amamzing experience,50,December 2017,Stayed in one of the Club villas and it was an inforgettable experience. The villa was beautiful and so well thought out. The staff were super attentive and genuinely friendly. Can't wait to come back!!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
579,A terrible place and way way overrated and overpriced,10,December 2017,Checked into a villa in the club which is supposed to be it. Well it’s dark and a dingy place. Way overpriced. Made a big mistake believing those earlier reviews. Stayed at Ritz Carlton in August this year and that’s a great place. If Ritz is 10/10 The Legian club is 0/10. One of the worst over rated places.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
580,Tranquil & relaxing,50,December 2017,"Stunning ocean views from the balcony, you could hear the ocean from your bed at nighttime. Great bar just a short wander down the beach, lovely swimming pool and breakfast on the balcony was just divine! The Spa was very professional and tranquil with great Balinese treatments. Overall short but fantastic stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
581,Lovely world class hotel facing the beach,50,July 2017,"Driving up to the lobby, one can immediately tell that our stay at this place was going to be wonderful. The lobby is elegant and the beachfront offers some of the best views in Seminyak. We had drinks at the poolside bar before having a delicious dinner at their signature restaurant.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
582,Our home in paradise,50,November 2017,"It is always a big pleasure to be back home in paradise. From the pick up at the airport and transport to the hotel and the check in , everything is perfect.it was so good to be back and to see everybody and to have this amazing warm welcome from them , all saying welcome home. It really feels to be back home . This hotel is amazing and one of the best, all the staff are amazing ,nothing to say . They made our stay so special ,the rooms are all sea view, luminous,extra clean and comfortable . The breakfast is one of the best i had ´ and the restaurant staff greeting us with those beautiful smile ...this is priceless. The pool , the beach , the spa ....what ever i say it is not enough . You get very special and very personal service here.by far one of the best hotel i have been to. Cant wait to go back . Thank you to all the Legian staff for their attention and services.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
583,Relaxing 5 Star Experience,50,November 2017,We had a very pleasant 10 day stay at the Legian Resort & Spa - it was the rooms & staff that stood out above the other hotels we have been in before in Bali - these were 5 Star not like some of the others saying 5 star but really only 3 or 4 - the service and attention to detail was exceptional - we will be returning to this hotel - approx 20 to 30 times in Bali 👍,The Legian Seminyak Bali
584,The best hotel of Bali,50,November 2017,"The Legian was the best hotel for our couple during our trip to Bali in November. Everything was great. The gourmet cuisine was astonishing. Service friendly and very good quality. Rooms well planned and serviced. Very cozy and well serviced sundeck area with three pools sizeable for swimming of adults also. Discrete security service. Placement on the nice beach in the very heart of the lively town was also very handy. If anything we've missed - it was more calm sea as waves on the beach didn't permit to swim as they were a bit too strong. But it's mother nature, isn't it? What is in man's hands - everything was really great in The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
585,"Entire stay was perfect, service impeccable.",50,November 2017,"From the moment we set foot in The Legian we were honoured to be greeted by The General Manager. This then set the tone for a perfect stay. Staff are amazing, the grounds simply beautiful and the rooms are simply awesome. Luxury at its best!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
586,Wonderful The Legian,50,December 2016,The Legian is a luxury Cool vibrant hotel in Seminyak . We have been here So many times and consisered this as a second home . Staff were there and always greeted you by name . Room is So spacious and love the ocean view . The spa here is probably the best !,The Legian Seminyak Bali
587,Kuoni brochure misleading,50,August 2017,"We booked a luxury holiday at the Legian, Bali - hotel was wonderful, one of the best - BUT, the surrounding neighbourhood is NOT as the Kuoni brochure describes, neither are the adjacent beachfronts. Kuoni offered compensation but we declined and will not use this agent again as they failed on a number of promises and their customer services intransigent. Hotel 5*, Kuoni 1*",The Legian Seminyak Bali
588,Amazing!,50,November 2017,"My husband and I have just arrived home from spending 5 nights at The Legian for our 30th wedding anniversary. From the moment we were met at the airport we were treated like royalty. Staff were personable and went above and beyond in making our stay relaxing. We were even surprised with a beautiful cake and bottle of champagne. Our room was luxurious and the grounds were truly beautiful. Location was perfect, a short walk into Seminyak. We will be back, can’t wait. Congratulations to all the staff on providing a wonderful stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
589,This is really good....!,50,November 2017,"This hotel deserves every good review it gets, it really is outstanding, And we must say the service is as near perfect as we have ever had, absolutely everyone does an excellent job, and they all seem so happy too, well done to you all!

The restaurant is excellent, dinner menu is outstanding, the breakfast is perfect too, a buffet/a la carte affair.. Even the pool bar is really good for lunch, and again the pool staff are so polite and professional.

The location of the hotel is great too, t is on the beach and only a very short walk from the busy Seminyak centre but far enough away to be peaceful.

Our room is lovely too, spacious, well equipped and very clean, it also included a complimentary soft drinks bar.

Finally the staff sent a birthday cake to our room for my partners birthday, thank you that was very thoughtful!! Small things can mean a lot.

Well done and keep up the good work, we will most certainly come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
590,First class in Seminyak!,50,November 2017,"Quality service is the highlight of the stay for my family and me. The staff consistently paid attention to details, from the reservation stage until the period of our stay. On arrival, there was a warm welcome with comprehensive info being shared about our suite and the facilities in The Legian. Throughout our stay, staff are friendly, helpful and professional. Some actually managed to remember my name within 24 hours.

The swimming pool has a very nice view of the beach and the sea. The beach is well maintained, clean, complete with lifeguard. I love the stroll along the beach from Petitenget in the north all the way to near Kuta area. I like the interior of the suite and vicinity as they wish to maintain traditional Balinese feel and mood. Some may argue it feels old, but to me it is more towards rustic and peaceful. There is also luxurious spa for those interested. Gym is located within the spa. Facilities in the suite function well; shower, bath tub, air conditioning, etc. There is ample provision of bottled water daily, and all items in the fridge and pantry are complimentary for consumption.

We had an enjoyable stay, totally forgetting that the volcano was lurking at the other end of the island.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
591,Great service & luxury at this hotel,50,November 2017,"We chose the Legian for a bucket list trip to Bali - a beautiful choice. First off, let me say that their 'standard' rooms are gorgeous. Every room is ocean view. Not sure why you'd need to book a suite. The living room area and terrace is spacious. The bed is firm & the pillows are perfect. The breakfast buffet includes everything you could ever want, and a menu too. The restaurant faces the infinity pool & the ocean - and dinner is as top notch as any other meal. The spa & fitness center are great too. The tour guide recommended by the concierge was extremely nice & knowledgeable in taking us all around the island.

Service is immediate at any time of the night or day. During our stay, we had need of medical attention for a bad insect bite. The on-site nurse was very helpful.

Our holiday stay was during rainy season, but we did not let the daily downpour stop us from enjoying this beautiful, friendly island.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
592,Impeccable and a Resort Beyond First Class,50,November 2017,"I have no words for this resort because everything was impeccable from the moment you arrived and till your departure. Staffs was always smiling and friendly. We stayed at the One Bedroom Deluxe Suite overlooking the pool and spectacular Seminyak Beach. Room are spacious and clean. Everything was detailed and furniture are up to date with no flaw. The Restaurant serves delicious cuisine for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Again the staffs are very attentive, polite and friendly. So another 5 stars for the staffs. On our last day, we tried the Spa and was assisted by Ayu and Yuli. Spa was awesome and I felt so relaxed rejuvenated after the treatment. At departure Ms Nadia Komala & Ms Lady Gwenne bid is goodbye. I strongly recommend this property for anyone looking for a relaxing holiday and I guarantee you will not regret it. Thank you so much Ms Nadia Komala for the excellent hospitality and a service beyond First Class. Nurul Moeckel, Singapore 😘",The Legian Seminyak Bali
593,wonderful stay,50,November 2017,"Just returned back from Bali Legian with great memories. From the minute we arrived till goodye staff has been the best ever. Great food, great rooms, great service, great location. Hotel Manager and Guest Realation Ms. Lady were always around with big smiles to see that everything was ok. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
594,WORLD CLASS.,50,November 2017,"There is a reason why this hotel has only 7 terrible reviews from 1500. Its because the hotel is hard to fault.

It may not be the flashiest and brightest on the strip but it does't need to be either. I believe a hotel is made up of many, many moving parts and when all these parts connect in unison you are left with a world class hotel. This is where The Legian stands tall.

I could write for hours about how good this hotel is but instead ill make a few short notes:

Staff - the best i've uncounted. From day one every staff member seems to know our name and greets us accordingly. They are are professional and so attentive to our every need. No task is too small or too big. Special mention to Agug who we always looked forward to seeing in the lobby each day.

Food - no matter where you eat, whether its by the pool or room service the food is world class and always fresh and well presented. They have clearly put in a lot of effort in this area.

Rooms - The hotel looks huge from the outside but with only 65 rooms it means the rooms square footage is huge. We had a one bedroom suite which came with separate dining and lounge area not to mention a guest toilet which is always nice. The bed is to die for and the interior design is on point. Special mention on the size of the balconies, they have huge day beds AND a little dining table with still plenty of space to spare.

Price - while this hotel may seem expensive to some, we did the numbers and things like breakfast and the mini bar all included you often take for granted those costs outside the hotel. ( they restock the mini bar and snack bar every day and keep topping it up which is so nice and all included in room rate)

The rest is, as above, including the pool area, the spa and nightly canapés for everyone in the pool area. As i mentioned before, a great hotel to me is a combination of many, many different things all being put together to make one amazing experience. For me this was it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
595,Not sure what all the fuss is about,30,November 2017,"I have to say, this hotel is massively overhyped. I should prefix this that I was a solo traveller in my late twenties. However, this place just seemed completely devoid of any atmosphere or soul. It's a large hotel with lovely room and a lovely pool. But I've been Tenerife which has the same at a fraction price. At the eye watering price they charge it just seems that you'd expect more. There's one pool and there's one restaurant. The restaurant is as overpriced as the rest of the hotel. I went to the spa to get a massage and at 1,500,000 IDR for an hour long massage (~£90) this was almost double the price of a very good massage back home. I asked the concierge where was good to go out, which seemed to stump him completely. The taxis they offer you are triple the price of getting one outside.

If this is your honeymoon - this is a lovely hotel. But honestly, beside yoga in the morning, there's nothing special about it. There's nothing else to do but sit by the pool and have afternoon tea. The service is impersonal and you should be prepared to spend a LOT of money.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
596,Beautiful Venue,40,November 2017,"We came here for evening cocktails. The hotel with the pool, crashing waves and fire features was gorgeous. Very beautiful hotel.

I would have given the hotel and bar area 5 stars; however, our service was extremely slow for only high-ball cocktails (vodka w/ a side of soda water and ice).

I would visit again though.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
597,11 out of 10,50,October 2017,"I am privileged to be a regular guest at The Legian, and from my earlier in-depth reviews (do have a look, if you want to know the details) one can see that I am biased. Of all my (very extensive) hotel experiences all over the world, both for work and pleasure, The Legian stands out as a true exception. Whether we are talking a LHW chain or small boutique hotels, I've never EVER had experienced that level of excellence in customer service and hospitality. It is not a compliment but a statement of fact. To be recognised by name by all the staff members from the very first day of my very first visit there years ago, to be still remembered by the staff, to be spoiled by them - as they still do remember all my personal preferences and tastes (say, at what time of the day I like to enjoy my green tea, and what is the ""correct"" way of serving it) - all that is beyond any reasonable expectation. When, as a regular guest, you are being greeted there on arrival with the words ""Welcome home"", they don't exaggerate: they do treat you as your personal staff would, should you had one. To profile each guest, to keep detailed records of guests' preferences, tastes, and idiosyncrasies, to brief all the staff prior to a guest's arrival on all these to make sure it is all well remembered, understood, and taken onboard - this is a commendable managerial effort.

I applaude the GM, M. Panchaud Francois, for his dedication, professionalism, and genuine love for this place. I wish The Legian all the success that they fully deserve, am very excited about their opening a sister hotel in Lombok, and look forward to being there guest yet again some time.

I want to thank the GM, the executive chef Luke MacLeod (Chef Luke), without whom it would have been a much different and less successful place, the management team (Wawan Soesanto), the service team (pool boys Pering, Alit, Buda, Budi, the other Budi, Oka, Adhi, Giri, the waiters and waitresses from The Restaurant (Dayu, Mrs S, Yoga, Tony, Surta, and all others whose names, sadly, I could never pronounce or remember), the drivers. You are the people who make this place exceptional, and I hope each one of you is properly recognised for this. Many sincere thanks to all of you.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
598,A glittering gem!!,50,October 2017,"Bali is a jewel encrusted crown. And The Legion a glittering gem within.
The true mark of a great hotel is how they handle the small things and The Legion, Bali was absolutely brilliant...flawless really.
Their staff always had a smile on the faces and a cheerful greeting.
The Studio Suite where we were guests was spacious, immaculately maintained and really, a home away from home.
The sunset views from the beach were nothing short of magical.
In short, we'd love to visit Bali and there'b be only place we'd be looking to stay in - The Legion Bali.
Much warmth and thanks to everyone at the hotel for a truly memorable stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
599,10 out of 10,50,October 2017,"A great hotel with fantastic very large rooms, every detail is taken care of from dawn til dusk.

The food, well start with the best breakfast in Bali, 63 degree poached eggs, WOW

Great poolside pizza made fresh with each order, and the best nasi goreng with pork floss YUM

Great staff, a great Head chef and a delightful GM
Thanks to all the team and for the lovely Managers Cocktail Party, see you again soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
600,Worth it?,40,October 2017,"Let’s just get it out there that this hotel is very expensive.
But, is a great place for relaxing by the sea. I’d suggest staying here for about 2 days, as although it is very lavish, it can get boring.
For all that money though, is it really worth it?
I would say yes. I highly enjoyed my stay here, and it did everything it promised. However, I would have liked to have seen something more, exciting. Like more hotel activities.
I would suggest for a someone going to Bali for the first time (as I was) to have a two stay holiday. This way you can stay in another hotel, and this one. (I would recommend the Maya Ubud). As you can use your other hotel to go out and explore the island and do activities, and the Legian as a kind of rest.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
601,Great Hotel,50,October 2017,"We had a very enjoyable stay in Oct 2017. It is a large and luxurious place, with a nice beach front, staff were great (as they all are in Bali) and after an upgrade to a sensational room - if you can get one of the villas you will want for nothing, location great for south parts of the island. In a nutshell if we went back to Bali we would go again",The Legian Seminyak Bali
602,Excellence at every level,50,October 2017,"I have been fortunate to have been a guest at The Legian many times over its 22 years. And it is as good today as it has ever been. The 75 suites mean that it maintains tranquil environment where ever detail is paid attention to. The service is exquisite. 6 Stars. Impeccable service from the moment you arrive; housekeeping and room service; nothing is a trouble for the front desk and concierge; the restaurant and pool/bar teams are superb. The spa is world class. The team is incredibly respectful and professional while at the same time delivering that beautiful Balinese friendliness. I have come to
consider many of the team friends. The grounds of The Legian are beautifully maintained with ample sun beds and day beds around and by the pool. Located in the upmarket part of Seminyak, The Legian is close to many great restaurants.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
603,Same as last year - Perfect!,50,October 2017,"After my first visit in October 2016 (see my detailed review written then - it is still accurate) I couldn't wait to go back to The Legian. I came back this year and just finished 9 day stay. The staff, the property, the rooms, the food and everything else is wonderful. I LOVE this hotel. It is paradise. The one thing I will add from my 2016 review is that on this trip I visited some of the other 5 star hotels (Four Seasons, W, Samaya, intercontinental) just to see what they weee like. The fact is that none of them stand up to The Legian. In terms on convenience, views, sunsets, beach location, etc., The Legian is simply a far better experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
604,The most perfect hotel experience of our lives,50,October 2017,"As I mentioned in a review of the restaurant at the Legian it's hard to put into words how utterly incredible this hotel is - there simply aren't enough superlatives in the English language. I don't think this review is ever going to do justice to the experience we just had of staying here and I cannot imagne how any future hotel we stay in will live up to the expectations this has fostered in us.

The start of our visit naturally was fantastic as due to them knowing it had been my birthday a few days before they upgraded us to a deluxe one bedroom suite. I am sure we would have been equally wowed by the studio suite we had booked but the new room really was beautiful. I have stayed in rooms close to this before but never with all the touches that make it exceed. The massive balcony looking over the sea with a double bed lounger and tables and chairs on it really stand out. The furnishings are just that more luxurious, the sheets and towels more opulent than I have seen before. The daily routines that deliver fresh fruit and flowers when the room is made up and a sweet treat, and poem and flower on the bed on turn down are lovely.

The hotel's location and layout also are just perfect - apparently all the rooms look out on to the ocean. Three cascading infinity pools rise up from the beach which ultimately leads to the restaurant. A bar at each side of the pool allows for both a great pause in your day for a lunch while provding an amazing setting for a drink or simpler dinner in the evening. The design of the pool area leading to the beach is inspired with the shallow pool at the top for the children leading down to the deep adult's pool at the bottom - you lounge at the level you are looking for and for us looking for peace at the bottom are almost unaware that above us some children are playing. The loungers near the beach make you feel like you are actually on the beach and create an ""infinity"" lounging experience.

Breakfast has to be called out as the best I have had in a hotel. The buffet elements are gorgeous but the cooked breakfasts are ordered at your table on demand and come perfect every time.

The staff at this hotel are also the best I have ever come across. Every guest's name seems to be memorised so they know who you are as you go through the hotel. Everyone in every role seems desperate to make your day and your stay better. The security guards keeping you safe who offer the taciturn smile making sure you can cross the road safely. The pool attendants who return every time your parasols need moving to keep you in shade if you desire, or to smooth out your towels when you go swimming. The continuous topping up of subtely flavoured water to keep you hydrated or the little tasters of a sorbet or iced tea that are brought to your lounger. Everything adds up to the most amazing experience. I am sure the hotel employees more staff on any day than there are guests.

It also needs mentioning how almost everything once you are here is complimentary. All the drinks in the mini bar, water bottles throughout the room, the daily refreshed fruit and snacks in your room, the afternoon tea every day at the pool, even a surfing lesson from the lifeguard they employee to keep you safe when swimming in the sea.

This hotel gets everything right, from the big things in it's original design down to the tiniest touches of every day staying there. I can easily believe it has been rated as one of the best in the world - I struggle to imagine what better could be. If you have the opportunity to stay here do not pass it up go and have your perspective about what hotel excellence is changed forever.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
605,Perfect End of our Honeymoon,50,October 2017,"The Legian is a home a away from Home. There are many luxurious hotels in the world, but they are all lacking the kindness of balinese people. We were welcomed like old friends and given an upgrade to a Deluxe Suite with oceanview. All the staff is helpfull and unintruive. They knew our names from the first day. From the second day they knew how i prefer my coffee and my breakfast eggs, they remember my favorite Sunset-Cocktail... The Legian offers so many little somethings: free minibar, mosquitospray, cold towels and cool water at the pool, daily sweets and more.
Thank you so much!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
606,Stunning hotel in a fantastic location with impeccable service.,50,October 2017,"This was one of the best rooms I have stayed in, with plenty of space for our family of four and a gorgeous view of the pool. Staff went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant, with incredible service. The infinity pool overlooking the ocean was perfect for relaxing. An amazing place to stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
607,Excellent Service!,50,October 2017,"We stayed in a two bedroom suite for a week with our family! We absolutely loved The Legian, the staff go above and beyond to make sure you are always looked after. Love that they make up he day beds by the pool for you and the lovely long breakfast! Afternoon tea is a highlight as is the complimentary mini bar. It's all the little things that make this place great. Restaurant food and room service was consistently good. During our stay we felt like the management really listen to what guests want and want to make sure you are entirely happy. Definitely recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
608,Holiday,50,October 2017,"What an amazing place. The hotel is excellent, the facilities and location fabulous. Great staff.
Wanted to stay on- 8 days wasn't enough!!
Highly recommended
Doesn't have have the birds of people coming and going. Truly 5 star. We are going back next year",The Legian Seminyak Bali
609,Top hotel and amazing staff,50,September 2017,"If you go to Bali, you should definitely plan to stay in The Legian. It is an experience you won't forget. The property is very beautiful with spacious rooms and great view just in front of the ocean. The staff does everything to make your stay pleasant. Will definitely go back there. Thank you all for treating us so well! Will never forget the friendly faces.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
610,An amazing,50,September 2017,"This is an amazing hotel! We stayed here for 8 nights in a one bedroom club villa and it couldn't have been better. The club is an oasis of peace and calm with all the benefits of the hotel only minutes away. Bona, our butler, was incredible and took care of our every need. Restaurants, day trips, local recommendations and service quickly tailored to our lifestyle, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you Bona!! The villa was fantastic! Very spacious and luxurious with great amenities. If you are having an outdoor bath give it at least 30 minutes to fill, its that big! The hotel is one of the best we've stayed in with an incredible position right on the beach. The architecture is very clever so that it feels as if the beach and the hotel are seamless. We ate in the main restaurant twice and the food is excellent. Don't miss the Wagyu steak! The ocean restaurant is more casual but equally as good with the sound of the waves crashing in the background. A tip, ask for the lunch menu as they are happy to serve that in the evening and is more extensive. Everything we tried was great! The service throughout was top class with a very friendly and warm approach. Everyone in Bali seems to smile! We had a massage at the spa which shouldn't be missed if you have time, very relaxing. Seminyak itself is busy and bustly but has great restaurants and it's fun to walk around the local shops and boutiques. Back at the hotel/club is a million miles away as you enter peace and tranquility. A great mix for a holiday. Overall a fantastic stay and we hope to be back despite the long journey to/from the UK. Finally, one last mention to the man who made it as special as it could be, Bona! Thanks from us both and I hope you are keeping well!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
611,WOWW... INCREDIBLE HONEYMOON STAY!!!,50,September 2017,"My husband and I stayed here for 7 nights. This hotel is exceptional! The service is excellent throughout the entire hotel. For example, the staff know you by name. They even offer to get you your drink before you even sit down! They consistently refill your water at the pool side and are ALWAYS willing to assist you. The Deluxe Room is beautiful, we had a very nice ocean view. The rooms are impeccably clean (thank you Jesna and Darmiko) and everyone is so polite, friendly. The complementary snacks and drinks in the rooms are fantastic! Unlike any other hotel I have been at or heard of. Makes you feel like you are in a home.
3 level Infinity Pool is stunning -and so is the Beach. For the beach i did not feel comfortable going out too far into the water as the waves are big and the current is quite strong. However, we still went far enough to enjoy the ocean water and had fun going into the smaller waves. Security at the beach, front lobby staff and and life guards were great! They make everyone feel safe. Beautiful Balinese musicians at breakfast and evening time. Truly this was such an incredible honeymoon for us. Spa is excellent as well! Daily Yoga, gym are great! Food is delicious too! I recommend this hotel to anyone really. Couples, families, singles, friends, business.! It was such a positive experience!!! I am not surprised that this hotel is one of the leading hotels in the world! This will forever be such a beautiful, memorable experience! Thank You, THANK YOU EVERYONE at the Legian Bali!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
612,It just keeps getting better!,50,September 2017,"It's been 3 years since I was last in Bali (at The Legian) and so I was desperate to stay here again for our 3 nights in Bali at the end of our cruise (a one-way Darwin to Bali cruise). It was a mother daughter trip and mum had not stayed here before and I wanted her to share the magical experience which is 'The Legian' and it did not disappoint. This was my third stay at the hotel and most definitely will not be my last. The staff are just as incredible as they were in 2014 and in fact the yoga instructor remembered me!! We were offered a room upgrade so it was lovely and spacious, mum loved the whole experience so much she basically didn't want to do anything other than hang in the room, by the pool etc. Afternoon tea by the pool was lovely, yoga each morning was fabulous, breakfast outstanding....need I go on? The Concierge kindly recommended a tailor who was able to very quickly do some alterations for me and they even dropped it back to the hotel so I didn't have to go out again. On our first day we also requested 3 nights of restaurant bookings which were made without issue and confirmed with a letter in our room. We were there when they were releasing baby turtles to the sea so that was also a special experience. There were definitely more children around on this stay compared to my previous visits. My only feedback to the hotel would be that they should monitor the pools to ensure that only kids are in the kids pool and potentially to consider having an area of sunbeds for 'adults only' so kids are not running around everywhere. I will definitely be back - won't be so long between drinks next time. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
613,Beautiful hotel,50,September 2017,"Had an amazing few days here. Great location, fabulous room and view and beach is so close. Staff are amazing and breakfast catered for everything. Nothing was too much trouble. Would recommend and return again. Very enjoyable stay and surroundings. Bar is expensive so we went outside.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
614,A wonderful hotel,50,October 2016,"I have been here with my friend and colleague for a week. The hotel is truly amazing, with a lot of facilities and good service. We recommend this hotel to all our friends and family as it definitely made our experience unique.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
615,Great Place to Relax,50,September 2017,"This hotel is close to all the things you wan to do in Seminyak yet when you are in the Hotel and by the beach you could be 100 miles away. Great Service and a really nice hotel,a bit pricey but worth it if you can afford it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
616,"This one is a must, simply the best!!",50,September 2017,"My wife and I have just spent 7 glorious nights at The Legian, Bali.

This hotel ticks every 5 Star box imaginable.

Outstanding staff who excel in customer service, attention to detail and incredible courtesy.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom luxury ocean view suite, which was a free upgrade from the one bedroom we booked. Palatial!!

The main restaurant is extraordinary,the seven course taster menu is a must, don't miss this gastronomic delight.

Breakfast is also magnificent.

Situated right on the beach the gardens, pool areas, beach bars and general surroundings are maintained meticulously, we wanted to spend most of our time within the complex as it was so beautiful.

I can't rate this hotel highly enough, it's remarkable!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
617,An incredible honeymoon experience,50,July 2017,"Myself and my husband spent the second week of our Honeymoon in Bali and we could not have asked for a better experience. This has got to be one of the most beautiful hotels in the world, with truly superlative service from the moment you arrive in your chauffeured car to check out. Where do you even begin? You feel like royalty at the Legian- the amount of treats and special things they do for the guests are in abundance. We had a drinks reception and canapés around the pool, daily afternoon treats including cold ice tea and sorbets (in addition to the afternoon tea snacks) we even got to release baby turtles back into the sea. An unforgettable experience. The staff all know you by name and greet you wherever you go. The moment you arrive on a sunlounger it is prepared with fresh, warm towels and iced water and sprays and cool cloths are brought out to your lounger table, decorated with a beautiful Balinese flower. The rooms are turned down 2 times a day, with little treats being placed in your room in the evening. We had champagne and a beautiful Honeymoon dessert cake on arrival. Blissful! The restaurant is out of this world for dinner (incredibly romantic setting) and the breakfasts are absolutely unforgettable (I'm still dreaming about those mini chocolate pancakes!) The hotel also occupies a superior spot right on the beach - other hotels also have great reviews along this stretch, but the Legian's beach frontage is something else- lush green ferns frame the grand (but not imposing) concrete wall which perimeters the hotel front - it looks like a beautiful jungle paradise. Some of the hotels had extremely run-down fronts - not the Legian. You really feel like you've chosen the best place on the beach when you're there. The spa is sensational (you can have a massage in the spa centre on the grounds of the hotel, listening to the water crash over the rocks as you relax), the architecture divine (walking around the hotel at night, the pools in the different areas are lit up with floating candles and incense is burned to give a beautiful vibe). Needless to say, your minibar is stacked full of treats, all free, and replenished daily. The only problem is, once you have stayed here, you'll never want to stay anywhere else in Bali. It is truly unforgettable.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
618,The Definition of Paradise,50,July 2017,"The Legian is an absolutely gorgeous place to spend your time in Bali. It's perfectly, centrally located in Seminyak and you can easily get to anything you can think of. The beach views are to die for, and the hospitality is second to none. We were here for a week for our honeymoon in July, and we would recommend it to anyone thinking about traveling to Bali. If we return to Bali from the U.S., we'll be back without a doubt! (Oh, and the sea turtle release into the wild was a highlight!) Too much fun at a gorgeous hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
619,🍸 The Legendary Legian 🎩,50,September 2017,"We live in Bali for many years now but stayed in The Legian while our villa was being prepared. Since then, we've always made it a point to return regularly and most regularly to their incredible Poolside-Oceanside bar. Whenever I'm there, I think this is how all hotels should be,classy, graceful, and fun. The staff always attend to us impeccably and know our drink preferences as we enter. Sunset is our choice time to visit and in my opinion, this is the best place to view it, with a Martini in hand of course. We love bringing our friends that visit Bali here and most definitely when they need accommodations, we recommend The Legian as well.

Don't change a thing Legian, everything is just right!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
620,Another amazing week at the Legian,50,September 2017,"We stayed here last year in a one bedroom suite and couldn't wait to come back. The quality of everything in the hotel - room, food, bed, furnishings - is exceptional, but the main reason to come back is the staff. Always friendly and super helpful and they all seem to know your name. The baby turtle release on the beach was a delight, as was the manager's cocktail party in the beach house. Looking forward to 2018!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
621,True hospitality!,50,September 2017,"This is our 2nd time staying in the Legian. We had a wonderful memory about this place 4 years ago and we intends to re-experience it again this year. As our final destination in our Bali holiday ( The Mulia, Amanwana then the Legian), it didn't fail our expectations and did put our whole holiday to a perfect end.
The staffs there are not just ""being friendly ""but are very attractive and paid attention to every little things you might care. Most of their staffs can recognize you and address you with the correct name and title, even though it's the first time you meet them.
We stayed at the ocean view deluxe suit. Nice sunset view and you won't hear any noise except the sound of waves. Room are spacious with a huge balcony. Everything are well maintained even though it's not a new hotel anymore. We used its spa and gym. The essential oil and massage oil used in the spa smell truly nice! We bought some bottles with a reasonable price. Gym is small but well equipped. Morning yoga class on the beach is also a good choice and seems to be quite popular with guests.
We had all our meals in the hotel restaurant and we were more than satisfied with our experience.
Final thing worth mentioning, the airport transfer service is more than a ride between hotel and airport. The hotel staff will escort you and help you with luggage check-in all the way to the immigration gate, to make sure you have a smooth departure.
We did enjoy every moment spent in the Legian and surely we will come back in the future!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
622,EXCELLENT HOTEL,50,July 2017,"Excellent Hotel, rooms are great & very clean. Warm & very friendly staff they always say hello & with a smile. Food & drink excellent as are the 3 pools. Lifeguards always have an eye on beach & at ready to help anyone. They are an Eco Turtle rescue Hotel & we were lucky enough to be part of a baby Turtle release. What an amazing & lucky thing to do in a lifetime!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
623,paradise,40,August 2017,"I use to stay in this place and this become my favorite location in Bali. Staff is exceptionally attentive. Suites all with sea view are large and quiet.
And probably the best breakfast spot on the island.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
624,Luxury hotel in the heart of Bali,50,August 2017,"I was so fascinated by the pictures of this hotel on TripAdvisor and the website. When I got there everything was even better. Pure luxury.

The suite (all the rooms are suites) was huge, clean and with care from the staff twice a day. The swimming pool is something to die for, especially if you want to enjoy the sunset with a great drink prepared by the pool staff.

Try the restaurant, I had there the best dinner in all my stay.

I will definitely return to this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
625,Totally perfect,50,August 2017,"We stayed in one of the club villas for three nights and it was divine. Super service from our butler, a room equipped with everything that one could wish for, exquisite food, and a service level beyond anything we have experienced in comparable hotels. Do go here if you have the opportunity.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
626,An oasis of calm and luxury,50,August 2017,"What a wonderful place to stay in Bali. Great position, and fantastic service. The two bedroom suite was perfect for a family of five. The attention to detail was amazing along with the nice touches such as the complimentary mini bar and afternoon tea.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
627,Simply the best,50,August 2017,"This is hands down the best property that I have ever stayed in. My husband too. The service is absolutely outstanding - polite, hard-working, completely focused on the guests. I have never seen anything like it! They think of everything and save you the hassle. The food here is delicious and the breakfast buffet is unparalleled. We did the tasting menu at the restaurant, ate in the room one night (so fun), and ate by the pool and at our chairs for lunch every day. We're still talking about the breakfast though! The rooms are beautiful with lovely products and serviced 2x a day by the staff with such attention to detail we were shocked. Chic french crowd staying while we were there. Lovely daily yoga and the spa is amazing. Best hotel in Bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
628,Pure tranquility,50,August 2017,"The Legian consistently delivers on everything expected. Great service, rooms, food, views, and overall sense of serenity when staying here. Suitable for all from honeymooners to families with young children, You can simply relax on the property with the amazing views or take a short stroll to numerous restaurants and shops in Seminyak.

The only comment I would make to management is that given the hotel although the rooms or very comfortable and spacious, its age shows in some little areas. But these in no way detract from the comfort of the rooms.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
629,The Only Place to Stay,50,August 2017,"My wife and I just returned from 10 nights at The Legian (August 6 - 16). It was our fifth stay in five years. On this occasion for the first time we had a Studio Suite on level 3 in the 1st block. Double balcony's (with day beds and dining setting) meant the suite and bathroom was flooded with natural light in daylight hours which was wonderful (and welcome in the bathroom). This is a very spacious suite by any standard.

This is a sophisticated facility. Only 67 suites (all facing the ocean) in such a large property ensures no overcrowding and everyone gets personalised service. If your looking for 'Kids Clubs' or organised resort activity perhaps a hotel in Nusa Dua would suit better.

The property is in the heart of Seminyak with easy access to great restaurants, bars and eateries but we found ourselves eating often at the Legian's main restaurant. We indulged in Executive Chef Luke McLeod's degustation menu ""Evolve' and it was sensational only added to by dining on the terrace overlooking the Indian ocean. You almost had to pinch yourself to make sure it was real!

Similarly breakfast is a daily worthwhile indulgence with the staff welcoming all guests by name...impressive!

We were there during the Hotels 21 year anniversary and while occasional comments may suggest the property is showing its age, we would disagree totally and suggest it is even more authentic, graceful and stylish amongst the increasing noise and bling of Bali!

Finally it is the staff that actually make the experience so special. Personable, attentive, engaging and tolerant. Many are long term employees and they are clearly the Legian's greatest asset.

This is an 'expensive' holiday compared to other Bali options but we find it impossible to stay anywhere else. Happy 21st Birthday to 'The Legian'. Another wonderful, indulgent holiday!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
630,Fully relaxed at the Legian!!,50,July 2017,"Great experience at the Legian! We stayed here for 5 days and this hotel is outstanding.
We stayed at a one bedroom Villa at the Club legian. Great for privacy and rest. Staff gives a high quality service and Agus made our stay memorable!

During our stay we visited the beach side of the hotel and that was great as well. Every evening we enjoyed cocktails/mocktails and had great food. The beach is so beautiful that you can spend all your time just relaxing there.

On our second day we also got a Balinese massage done that took all tiredness away.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
631,So Romantic,50,February 2017,This is the Grand Lady and Grande Damme of all Hotels in Legian. It is so beautiful and simply delicious. The pool next to the sea is a real bonus as you can swim in a perfectly kept pool next to a gentle salty sea breeze. This is a very classic hotel but it really attracts a wide demographically distributed verity. The dinning room has the perfect view and i do believe they have just launched a Champagne activity...one for the check list.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
632,wonderful magical stay,50,August 2017,"This is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. The staff are definitely the best i have ever met- they go above and beyond expectations- so friendly and helpful - they complete spoil you from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. Many of them have been with the hotel for years which is testament to the good management of the place. The hotel itself is 21 years old and a little tired in places due to the beachfront location and having to cope with the wind and the salty ocean spray but you really dont notice this as the ocean view and gardens are so beautiful you just dont want to leave. The pool staff come around with iced water/ cold flannels all day and offer you lovely treats like sorbet /icecream and at 4pm theres the afternoon tea- heavenly as you lay there watching the surf and soaking up the sun. We loved it all.
we stayed in a suite which was on the ground floor and we could walk straight out onto the gardens and the beach which was lovely but if i return i think i would prefer to stay a bit higher up to get a better sea view as i found our room quite dark .
The pool area was amazing with a 30m long infinity lap pool plus 2 other pools tiered above this with plenty of sunbeds and shade if needed.
The food in the restaurant was wonderful and first class. we also loved the breakfasts - a huge choice of gorgeous treats hot and cold all wonderfully presented and lots of fresh juice and smoothies made to order.
The hotels location is very central too and easy walking to Seminyak central where there are loads of bars and shops if you fancy a change of scene.
We cant wait to return and look forward to hearing about the opening of the new Legian in nearby Lombok island next year where we will definitely be first in the queue to book. if you have good taste, love quality, great service and appreciate the finer things in life this place is definitely for you.Its not cheap but worth every penny.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
633,Beachfront luxury,50,July 2017,"My husband and I recently spent five nights here, priority was a quiet and relaxing spot with good views.
The Legian lived up to expectation. We were picked up by our driver and immediately felt at home with a warm welcome from hotel staff. Our room was upgraded to a suite which was spacious and private. The hotel is Balinese style, very well kept. Accomodation includes a complimentary daily replenished mini bar with beer, drinks and snacks, the snacks predominately home made crisps, spiced nuts, cookies etc. delicious. A complimentary afternoon tea is also offered daily at poolside or in your room. Small things which count.
The hotel itself very attractive and meticulously kept surrounds. The pool area glorious and not overcrowded.
The hotel restaurant is top quality, whether fine dining, casual or breakfast food was top notch. We felt the hotel was the best choice in the area. The hotel is central, and has good restaurants and cafes at walking distance when you want to venture out.
We found service excellent without being overbearing. The staff ensured anything we needed was attended to promptly and very helpful with where to go, what to see and best way to see it.
We hired a driver from the hotel for our day or half day trips and found this was a great way to get around and learn about Bali for first timers, locals know their land and can give you a great guided tour.
We had a great first experience in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
634,Spectacular,50,July 2017,"The Legian is a beautiful hotel where everything is perfectly maintained, the food delicious, the staff is outstanding and the reason I chose it originally is its located on a great long board surfing beach (body surfing too)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
635,Amazing hotel,50,September 2016,"Had ana amazing stay here. Great location, lovely staff and amazing facilities. The free afternoon tea by the pool each day is a nice touch. You effectively want for nothing whilst you are here, and the breakfast was very good.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
636,Ocean front Pampered pleasure @ Seminyak centre,50,April 2017,"Wow, wow, wow‼️ The property entrance commands attention, exudes exclusivity and screams protection. Yay!!

Its just steps from busy, touristy streets but you would not know it once inside the ""fortress"".

The welcome drink should be sold all over the world.

The decor is modern dark wood with light fabrics. Comfortable, crisp and clean everything.

The breakfast manager remembered my
a la carte preferences, without prompting, the entire week. The day I was left the property too early to have breakfast, the manager and chef prepped a to-go of my favorite pastries and fruits.

The three-tiered infinity pool and world-class spa rounded out a spectacular vacation. I planned on two spa treatments and ended up getting 6 because the offerings were so unique.

We had two balconies, a living room, king bed and bathroom.

We did NOT want to go home, I mean it. We were treated like family-favorites by the entire staff.

FYI, while it is an ocean front property the waves routinely met the property wall making it unsafe to recline or swim there. However a short walk to the right provide safer ocean access. Again, the pool grounds were so spectacular and relaxing that watching the ocean was sufficient for us.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
637,Beyond Expectations!!,50,August 2017,"That is saying a lot as my expectations were already sky high. This hotel was a dream come true! The level of service is the best we've had anywhere. If you get a chance to work with Diki in the Club Villas then you will know what it feels like to be treated like royalty and family all in the same. We love the rooms! Every amenity you could need was provided. They got to know your likes and made sure to follow thru day after day. (For example, one day I asked for limes for my water bottle, the next morning my refrigerator was stocked with fresh cut limes) Daily yoga on the lawn was surreal with the back drop being the ocean. The food at poolside was delicious and the breakfast buffet was amazing. (The lattes were incredible!)
Rides/Shuttles were available 24/7 to anywhere! The staff throughout the entire hotel got to know you by name. It was a dream come true.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
638,Near perfection,40,August 2017,"Rented a villa for a week and absolutely loved it: it was beautifully and luxuriously simplistic, very private with high fences and no outside noise. The butler service is a big bonus. Private pool, hotel spa and pools, seaside location, pricey restaurant are all 5*. The only minus one is the absence of sporting facilities but, hey, we managed to stay very active anyway.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
639,Excellent luxury beach resort in Seminyak,50,August 2017,"Absolutely the best, it has a long stretch of beach, sand is soft though not white, good waves & you can take surfing class at Rupiah 200,000 an hr. Our orig 2 bedroom suite (214) booked thro travel agt is nice but we are right above the restaurant & our 'ocean view' from 1/F is 90% blocked!!! Eventually the staff has nicely helped us relocate to 324 on 2/F & the view is nice & open! I would recommend to book directly through hotel as they even had a buy 3 & get 1 night free now which of cos our agt did not pass us the benefit! Hotel big car only costs USD55 while our agt got us a small car for 4 & it was called last min for a street car!!! So upset!
Amazing hotel staff, not much facilities if you are looking for fun except beach, free yoga class & spa but that's all we need for a lovely family holiday! Thank you, will be back!!! Highly recommended!!! Great location with shops, bars & restaurants walking distance but the hotel restaurant serves fantastic food!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
640,The best I've experienced in Bali so far,50,August 2017,"I've been to Bali many times and have stayed in numerous resorts. This is by far the best and in my opinion, the only which merits repeat stays for future visits to this marvellous country. The hotel is pure understated elegance. The studio suite, the entry level smallest suite, is already huge and mpressive. Facilities are luxurious. The restaurant is excellent and my single dinner there was probably the best I've had in Bali for a long time. The breakfast, which is included in the room rate is also very good.

The service in the Legian sets it apart from the other luxury resorts where I've previously stayed. For a large resort, the staff learnt my name extremely rapidly. We were greeted by name throughout the resort. The pool and beach attendants were first class. Attentive, responsive and accommodating. They ensured everything was always in order for us as we lounged on the deck overlooking the magnificent Seminyak beachfront. The lifeguard was exceptional in his vigilance of the well being and safety of the hotel guests who ventured out into the ocean. Of particular note was how one of them watched me and my Daughter trying to learn how to boogie-board. Next thing we knew, he appeared beside us with his own board and spent some time teaching us how best to enjoy this activity.

The waiting staff at the restaurant and the pool cafe were very good. Of particular note was Darma at the pool cafe. His wonderful disposition truly made us feel welcome and special. His enthusiam for the menu items, his eagerness to offer his services and even his joy at engaging guests in conversation were outstanding.

The spa offers some of the best massages I've enjoyed in a very very long time. Great decor and lay out. Very very good Therapists.

I spent thoroughly enjoyable days at The Legian. My only regret was that this was way too short. I was on a short break with my daughter but I will certainly return with the rest of the family for a longer stay.....hopefully very soon",The Legian Seminyak Bali
641,Bali holiday,50,July 2017,Just gorgeous. The 1 bedroom suite is just beautiful and the service is just amazing. All the staff go above and beyond to make your stay such an enjoyable one. The chef's take so much pride in their dishes not only do they look great but they taste amazing. Will definitely be back agin.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
642,AMAZING EXPERIENCE AT THE LEGIAN,50,January 2017,"I can't say enough amazing things about The Legian and their staff. We stayed in two different types of rooms on the property. First, we stayed in an ocean front suite. Upon arrival, were picked up by a driver who escorted us over to the hotel where we were greeted by a front desk concierge/reservationist. I can't remember his name, but he was very helpful in letting us know everything about the property and the room we would be staying in. The ocean front suite was beautiful, relaxing, spacious and clean. Overall, our visits to the spa were relaxing, and the service from the spa and restaurant/bar that we received by the pool was excellent. After 3 days of our stay in the ocean front suite, we moved over to a villa which is located at The Club. This villa is what dreams are made of! The Villa was so gorgeous, I'll try to put it into words, but I think I will fall short! Not only is the villa completely private, each one has their own pool! Just outside the bathroom you can find the outdoor jacuzzi which I thoroughly enjoyed! It was filled with fragrant flowers when we checked in, which was very sweet. (This was also done for us in the regular room - a very nice touch!) I loved the koi pond that surrounded the villa, it was fun and relaxing to feed the koi and watch them swim gracefully in their pond. However, what made our stay rate above 5 stars was our host/butler. His name is Sande, and he deserves so much praise! Sande is informative, helpful, sweet, hard-working and genuine. He answered all our questions about the Balinese culture, fruits, foods, and traditions. You can tell he really loves what he does, and he's very proud of his culture. He's amazing and I hope that he will be able to read this! Sande chauffeured us one of the days as well. We visited the Monkey Sanctuary, an art gallery, and a local eatery where we had a Balinese special: suckling pig! It was a great day overall, despite getting caught in some rain. Unbeknownst to us, we were visiting in the rainy season. After 7 days at the Legian, we packed up and headed to Ubud. Upon checkout we said our goodbyes to Sande, and were given a warm farewell from the hotel managers. I raved about Sande to them, and advised I'd be writing a 5 star review which was much deserved! In all honesty, I wish we would have just stayed at the Legian for the entire honeymoon. I hope to be at The Legian back one day!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
643,Not entirely satisfied,30,August 2017,"We were planning on staying (as a family) for 10 days in The Legian but decided after one night to check out and move to another property. Why?
The Legian has a great location IF you are planning on staying in vibrant Seminyak.
The Hotel is Asian and European influenced and ""boutique"" style while being quite large.
I think we just expected ""more"". After a long travel from Europe we just felt not really welcomed. We checked in late at night, Dinner was not available and the welcome was rather uneventful. The rooms are +/- 20 years old and in ok shape but not wow.
We decided to switch to a resort in Nusa Dua which we like much more.
I also did not see any kids activities - could be that they have some but this was not explained go us.
When I informed the Hotel that i am checking out they were first informing me that they will charge my full stay, after I explained them that i dont like the hotel and felt that the service is below my expectations, they were extremely understandable and ""just"" charged me the 1 short night we stayed there.
They also offered me an upgrade and to show me various alternatives but by then i fell already in love with Nusa Dua and one specific resort there.
I guess i was extremely disappointed as I took the time before to send them various emails and explaining them what I exactly would like to rooms to look like and what I need for my family and not a lot of that was reflected.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
644,As close to perfect as it gets!,50,July 2017,"My wife and I spend 4 nights at The Legian as part of our honeymoon. It was such a lovely stay and I was so impressed with the high level of service.

The Legian is not the cheapest option but I think you would be hard pushed to find a better beach hotel in Bali.

The pool is gorgeous, the beach is the best around, views from rooms are fantastic, the breakfast is wonderful, housekeeping are amazing and the service at the pool area is to a very high standard. I really do not think there is any request too big or small and the whole team would go out of their way to make sure you had a perfect stay.

I don't think I have ever been so sad to leave a hotel and we'll definitely be back. Highly recommended for honeymooners!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
645,Best Stay Ever,50,July 2017,"Me and my husband had just returned from 4 nights stay in The Club one bedroom villa with private pool. We have nothing but praises for this property.

Firstly, upon arriving at the airport, a hotel staff is already waiting for us to fetch us in a private car (complimentary for The Club guests). Cold towels and drinks were offered the moment we got into the vehicle, there's even wifi in the car! The hotel driver was extremely warm and chatted with us along the way.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were brought to our villa immediately. We need not go through the hassle of checking in as it was all done in the comfort of our villa. We were very lucky to be able to check in the villa early as the previous occupant had left the night before. I really appreciate this as some other hotels I went simply refuse early check in even though the room was empty.

The villa is HUGE, spacious, clean, airy and smelled nice, private pool is of a good size, many outdoor lounging area. It may not be the newest property, but we can tell that the hotel took very good care of the room keeping it spick and span for their guests. Decor is warm and has a Balinese touch, very beautiful. Mini bar is complimentary, and the hotel is very generous with the mini bar (replenished daily), there were alcohol, juices, soda, crackers, chocolate, chips I can go on & on. In the room, there are ipods preloaded with loads of songs to be enjoyed with the terrific sound system. Within 15mins of arriving at the villa, we were already impressed beyond words.

We decided to check out the hotel that is across the street , it is just 1min walk away, Club staff can also send you in a buggy. We walked anyway and was surprised that the guards actually stopped the traffic so we could cross the street safely! I really felt I was treated like a king!

At the hotel, you will be greeted by the beautiful sea view, amazing beach. There are lots of sun chairs to laze around. Sunset view is superb from the hotel, you don't have to go elsewhere to jostle with the crowd. The hotel serves complimentary tea break between 4-6pm and cocktail between 6-8pm, perfect for enjoyment to catch the sunset.

Just a few minutes walk from the hotel, you can get to Seminyak street for quality shopping, lots of restaurants and bars. By the way, Seminyak is much more “peaceful” area compared to the nearby Legian street or Kuta street if you are looking for quality boutique shopping and less rowdy crowd. The club offers complimentary shuttle within Seminyak area, if you going elsewhere, do get the hotel to call for a metered taxi for you.

Back at the villa, you will enjoy supreme privacy. You can enjoy tea break, cocktail, meals inside your villa without stepping out. A butler is assigned to our villa and we were very well taken care of. Our butler is Diki, very cheerful always smiling and helpful to get us what we needed. In fact, all, ALL the staffs are extremely helpful. It only shows the hotel is very interested in making their guests feel happy, comfortable and pampered with their unparalleled service and thoughtfulness.

Overall, we had an enjoyable stay. The location of the hotel is excellent, you get the beach, restaurants (potato head and kudeta are just minutes away), bars, cafe, everything within walking distance. We are looking forward be back again. Thank you The Legian Bali for my wonderful stay. :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
646,Still Beautifully Maintained Resort,50,July 2017,"4 Nights of a super relaxing and pleasant stay.
Room was clean and well maintained. Excellent service with very attentive staff.
Very good selection for the breakfast buffet.
And super convenient location in the middle of nice restaurants and shops.
Would definitely come back and stay again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
647,The Club at The Legian is simply outstanding,50,July 2017,"Words cannot describe the level of quality and service this hotel provides. I am aware that ""The Club"" is slightly more exclusive, but we dined and had breakfast at The Legian too and everything about this hotel exudes luxury.

We wanted for nothing, the most complimentary offerings we've ever had: from the Villa snacks, drinks (Incl. Alcoholic drinks), Canapés, afternoon tea, incense, evening treats, anniversary gifts, welcome gift, morning Yoga, to the amazing spread for breakfast which was by far the most variety and quality I've ever experienced. The Restaurant provided excellent food too.

Our Butler Eka was on call constantly, what a gentle soul. He was willing to please beyond anything we could ever need. Reservations, car services around Seminyak. Our Villa was mesmerising, so was our private pool, the Koi fish in our personal fish pond. What incredible service! Even the communal pool at The Club, which was empty most of the time and so serene, was utterly perfect for swimming laps at my own leisure.

I am completely enamoured with this hotel and would be willing to visit Seminyak just for the Hotel alone. By far the best hotel we have ever stayed at, and that isn't an over-statement. A true gem!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
648,nice,50,July 2017,"i like the (The Legian Bali) it is a nice place to stay nice food nice rooms and nice pools as well people and very nice as well so i want people to go there to stay in there nice place.

from Thalia Mead",The Legian Seminyak Bali
649,Timeless Bali Luxury,50,July 2017,"We stayed for three nights in a two bedroom suite with our teenage kids. The room was huge, the bathrooms were big enough for my son and daughter to not get in each other's way. The view was amazing. Fantastic breakfast. Nice pool.

We decided to have some of our holiday in Legian and the rest in Nusa Dua at the Ritz Carlton. We thought it would be nice to relax at the Ritz after all the busyness of Legian. We were so wrong, the Legian was so relaxed behind the walls to the street, you don't realise you are in such a busy place until you go for a walk vs something like the Ritz that's just a big tourist factory, we even tried to cancel the Ritz once we arrived to go back to The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
650,The Best,50,July 2017,"My partner, son and I have just been spoiled with six nights at The Legion Bali - 4 in the Joglo Club Villa and 2 in the Sunset Suite - both stunning but in different ways. The hotel is perfectly located - close enough to the Seminyak town centre but not too close and on the best part of the beach strip.

We were lucky enough to be assigned Diki as our butler (he's in high demand but I trust all are equally gracious and attentive). We're not accustomed to having such support but his thoughtfulness, long day commitment and friendly nature made our stay an absolute dream.

In fact, all of the staff are fabulous - clearly the best The Legian could employ. The hotel invests heavily in their development and it shows in their service and long tenure. The General Manager can often be seen engaging with guests around the beautifully maintained resort.

The Restaurant provided no reason to leave the comfort of the hotel and the team under renowned chef Luke MacLeod prepared top class food all day around. We also visited the Spa for two hours of sublime luxury. Really, there is nothing to fault so I won't go on.

If you want the best, I doubt you'll beat The Legian Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
651,Total Luxury .... Unparalleled Service!,50,June 2017,We had 2 blissful weeks at The Legian in a one bedroom suite facing the beach! It was just divine and we will definitely visit again! We are regular visitors to Bali but normally stay in a private villa ... this time we decided to have a change! We are now planning our next trip and we are certain we will return to The Legian! Our suite was 'to die for' and all the staff were attentive and helpful! Take me back!!!!!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
652,Best location ever in Seminyak,50,July 2017,We came here for some cocktails to drink at this superb hotel. The location is amazing and the infinity pool and the hotel by himself is beautiful. We drunk some cocktails and had really good service.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
653,One of the best properties I've ever stayed in. Spa was superb.,50,July 2017,"The suites are simply amazing, displaying authentic Balinese culture. Their spa is also a must-try and the therapists truly know what they are doing. The treatment they gave me was perfect for relaxation. I will come back for sure!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
654,Pure Quality,50,July 2017,"We stayed at this hotel for the second week of our honeymoon and were not disappointed at all.
The upgraded deluxe suite was amazing and like an apartment overlooking the sea .
Every day there are complimentary cakes and fruit and the toiletries are top notch .
The staff are extremely professional and well drilled but friendly with it .
The breakfasts and bar food are also amazing .
My only small gripe is the price of the wine in the restaurant . It really is way over priced and I was stung one evening on champagne .
An excellent place to stay .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
655,Best experience ever. not only the room etc. best service is the most attactions,50,June 2017,"Best experience ever. Not only the room, bed, food etc. Those you can see from pics online plus more or less the same among the 5 stars. What attracts me the most is the best service. You never see any staff hanging around do nothing, they will always come to you whenever you need something. By this you will neither feel disturbed nor been forgotten. I really do not know how they can manage that :)
I traveled with seniors and kids booked 2 bedrooms suite with ocean view. Room size is very big with living + dining area. Snacks & drinks in room with no extra fees, even have very nice music in room.
Very good food as well. Buffet breakfast have lots of choices, perfect coffee. Bar right next to the pool very convenient. Dinner is very good too. The set menu with 5 courses was a bit too much for us (we all are slim person do not eat lot for supper) they are able to adjust to 3 course meal. We have tried snapper grilled in banana leaf for main & Souffle for dessert (personally care more about the dessert :P) All my family members love everything.
This hotel has private beach, best spot for sunset. no need to go outside for sunset.
The only thing need to think about is the traffic outside hotel is crazy during the day. If plan to go outside by car better plan as early as possible to avoid traffic.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
656,Simply Stunning,50,May 2017,"We recently had the wonderful opportunity of returning to The Legian in Seminyak for a few days and once again it was a truly blissful experience.
The things that seem to consistently stand-out are:- the quality of the service, warm welcome, cleanliness and attention to detail unparalleled in every way. The suites are spotless and all are spacious and are cool and calming. The internal furnishings are quiet on the eye, bathrooms have everything you need including soft fluffy towels. The balcony includes a large daybed with views over the ocean. The mini-bar includes most of the usual suspects (included in the room price) e.g. selection of soft drinks, mineral water as well as beer. Nuts, Indonesian Crisps and Cookies and even chocolate are also part of the mini-bar and replenished daily.
Outside of the hotel you will find that there are many cafe and restaurant choices just five minutes walk away. The Seminyak area can become quite congested with traffic which is a downside so being able to walk to various good dining venues is a real plus.
Within the hotel there is an amazing fine dining restaurant under the leadership of chef Luke who takes genuine pride in working with and mentoring his dedicated staff. Their food collaborations make for a combination of modern and traditional Indonesian cuisine. If you want to dine seaside, try the beach bar, you will enjoy a more casual dining option with a variety of choices on offer. Weather permitting the stunning sunset is spectacular from any vantage point at this beautiful property.
If you are visiting Bali and want to bliss-out, relax and feel pampered then you can't go past The Legian. I would stay again, especially if splitting my stay between Ubud and Seminyak or Jimbaran Bay and Seminyak.
Thank you to all the hotel and restaurant staff for their unobtrusive, caring, professional service.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
657,Amazing honeymoon stay - faultless,50,July 2017,"We stayed at the Club at the Legian for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon. It was nothing but amazing from start to finish. Our butler, Sande, was super helpful and we really got used to the little details in the villa everyday such as breakfast laid out for us every morning, laundry done and ironed to perfection, checking our plans every day to see if anything was needed. We really liked how there was access to all the facilities in the hotel which was also brilliant. Afternoon tea in your villa or in the Club Lounge or main hotel every day from 4-6 was a real perk, followed by cocktails 6-8pm. The view from the 3 infinity pools out over the beach is stunning - you really don't need to go anywhere else to watch sunset. We also ate in the Legian restaurant and had the 8 course tasting menu which we thought was brilliant too. We cannot wait to return. 10/10 and the best hotel we have ever stayed in.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
658,Good hotel. But be careful of your belongings.,40,June 2017,"We stayed there for 4 nights and 5 days. Took a one bed room pool villa. The hotel was nice enough to accommodate all four of us, 2 adults and 2 kids aged 2 & 3 years in the same room which I understand was an exception from their norms of not more that 3 in a room. But they did charge us like almost USD$ 150/day for the extra bed. Which is really expensive. Everything from booking to airport pick up was convenient. The staff are courteous and the service is good. The mini bar in the room is complimentary and it is replenished once a day. Laundry is free or I guess it's included in the room price. The breakfast buffet was good but not many vegetarian options. The cold pizza was very natural cereal unfortunately it was kept only once during our stay. Other wise the regular buffet. Limited options. The evening tea and night cocktail both times served with some snacks were good. We don't drink alcohol hence were given some mocktail options, they weren't too great. But the snacks were good. Everything was going just fine suddenly one morning when we found the $200 missing from my pocket which was there earlier when we left the room for breakfast. The card in my pocket had fallen on the floor and the money missing. We did complain to the hotel management. They did some sort of an internal inquiry which I was not part of and told us that sorry our staff say that they haven't stolen it. I did have a long chat with their duty manager but nothing fruitful. The rooms are nice and spacious, the pool is good. But the hotel is aging and it's easily visible. The outdoor pools are nice and big. Other that one incident where we lost money the stay was convenient. Airport drop was also included in our room package. Kids liked the place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
659,Luxurious Setting & Service Excellence,50,June 2017,"My cousin and I visited Bali for the first time and I must say that It will definitely not be our last. It was a business visit with some R&R.

The Legian hospitality is by far the best I have experienced. Many times I have stayed in 5 star hotels which are well appointed but lack personalised customer service. The Legian addresses this issue in a way like none other. You are greeted by name on arrival with a nice refreshing towel and welcome drink waiting for you. Check in is such a breeze, forget about queuing up at reception, you sit down and relax while the staff (Dwi & Julita) do that all for you whilst you're sipping on lemongrass iced tea. After a 6.5hr flight and 1hr car ride it was so nice to kick start the stay at The Legian like that. I honestly did not think that it could get any better. That was until Miss Julita informed that she had upgraded our rooms to a higher floor, suite with spectacular ocean views. I understand that the hotel occupancy was quite full during our stay, so we really appreciated this gesture. Could not thank her enough.

Upon check in we were given the tour of the hotel and amenities before being guided to our room where staff showed us how to operate the room cooling, safe box and iPod. Yes there is relaxing music playing in your room, it's such a nice touch to the ambience. The room was tastefully decorated with parquetry flooring, natural timber cabinetry and natural stone in the bathroom. Our rooms included a large balcony with sun bed that faced the ocean and a butlers pantry whereby the drinks and snacks (complimentary) get replenished daily. Never had I experienced a hotel mini bar that is complimentary. Adding to the personal touch was a welcome letter and fresh tropical fruits. Absolutely awesome!

The hotel has 2 restaurants which we tried on separate occasions. One is a fine dining experience with choice of a la carte and also degustation menu and the other a more casual affair in a beach hut style. Both restaurants have excellent service and wait time for the food was not long. I highly recommend the mixed satay and duck pancake at the casual dining and the Stockyard Sirloin and fish fillet cooked in banana leaf with sambal sauce at the fine dining restaurant. It will not disappoint.

Breakfast is served in the main restaurant in a buffet style setting PLUS a la carte menu for made to order items such as eggs benedict , eggs your way with your choice of filling and sides and waffles and pancakes to die for! By far the best breakfast selection I have experienced. Recommend the fruit bowl with coconut sorbet-yum!

Between 4pm - 6pm there is afternoon tea also, if your in the hotel during this time u must try it. A mixed platter of sandwich, mini cup cakes and choice of coffee or tea. Very nice way to relax soak in the sunset and ambience.

The gym is well appointed with cardio machines and for (hotel standards) quite a large range of free weights and machines for the gym junkies. Yoga and Pilates also have their seperate area.

My only regret is that I did not try the SPA as time did not permit. Definitely will try it next time, I highly doubt that it will disappoint me as this hotel has only exceeded my expectations on every level so far.

Regarding location of the hotel- very convenient. 5 mins walk to Seminyak Square. Around 5 mins also to KuDeTa and approx 10-15 mins walk to potato head beach club.

Another truely unique experience that we have never seen before was the hotel arranged to release some new born turtles back to the natural habitat , it was truely breathtaking and an experience like none other.

Based on service (always with a smile), amenities, location and ambience The Legian Bali is 10/10 to me. I truly enjoyed my stay and glad my first time in Bali was at The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
660,A fantastic resort in every sense......,50,July 2017,"My family had a two room villa with a private pool and courtyard. Our rooms and private space was truly luxurious. Our butler Arisna (I hope I spelled his name correctly) provided our family stellar service.

The food at the hotel was delicious and all the servers were great to deal with. I recommend this hotel...and if you can swing for the Villa- go for it!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
661,Lovely well managed,50,June 2017,"We spent several days here relaxing and enjoying the beach and pool. The service is great , the rooms perfect and the food well done. The town near by to busy and crowded but on the grounds of the hotel you never know it exists",The Legian Seminyak Bali
662,Excellent choice away from the crowds,40,November 2016,"An cozy luxury resort away from the crowds with lovely gardens, tender and caring staff, and excellent restaurants. We had a room on the top floor with a big balcony facing the ocean. The sounds of ocean wave rings in your head after months of coming back to reality. It is one of the best resorts in Bali and I would definitely come back again. But make sure you don't get a room on the ground floor. Otherwise you will never see the daylight as it is dark and gloomy.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
663,Everything is lovely,50,June 2017,"Impeccable hospitality services at The Club, lot of perks like complimentary laundry, mini bar and free flow of alcohol beverages from 6-8 pm daily.

The one bedroom villa was comfortable and spacious even we though we squeezed in 4 of us as all the 2 bedrooms villa were snapped up.

The Butler Yasa that served us, was absolutely meticulous! He went beyond his duties and accompanying my elder daughter to braid her hair at a nearby salon while i went for spa treatment and my hubby was with the little one was at the pool.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
664,Fantastic-the best holiday hotel we've ever stayed in.,50,June 2017,Fantastic hotel with lovely ambience and brilliant friendly staff who seem to anticipate all your requirements without being overbearing. Delightful food too. Everything was thought of and the facilities are excellent.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
665,Absolute Perfection,50,June 2017,"My husband and I stayed at the Legian for the first time and were absolutely blown away by this magnificent resort. Could not fault any part of our wonderful stay - the staff, room, pool, view, food were all above excellent. Would absolutely recommend and can not wait to get back to this beautiful paradise :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
666,Stunning Property,50,May 2017,"This is a stunning property, and staying here is a fantastic experience.
The suites, overlooking the ocean, are spacious, clean and offering amazing views of Seminyak beach. The rooms are modern, yet blend beautifully into the Balinese landscape. Every convenience awaits you in the suite - iPod doc, pantry stocked with treats daily (including chips, chocolate, nuts, etc), a huge bathroom with lovely Italian bath products, a good balcony, and more.

Visiting the pool each day was a highlight - the pool itself is stunning and overlooks the ocean. The staff are amazing - constantly bringing around water, ice creams, etc. You can also have a foot and shoulder massage while lying at the pool - bliss!

The property's grounds are beautifully presented also.

It's in a great location - walking distance to amazing boutiques, and incredible restaurants.

My only issue with Seminyak is the rubbish that is always on the beach, and the smell from Bali's growing rubbish problem. Stepping from The Legian onto the beach and going for a short stroll, you will notice plenty of rubbish on the beaches, which is very sad. I'd be interested to know what The Legian is doing to assist with cleaning up the beaches, and helping the locals with their rubbish issues. I will certainly return to this incredible property, but I'd like to think, as a good corporate citizen, that they are doing their bit to help keep Bali beautiful. One thing I did love was that this property does not use plastic straws - fantastic initiative!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
667,Outstanding - Exceeded Expectations,50,June 2017,"This is one of those hotels, old school service and nothing but the best. I had visited the property previously but never stayed. I am amazed at the level of service they have achieved, all staff are just wonderful, from the moment we checked in to our departure we were surrounded by helpful staff all concerned that we had the best time possible and we did. I have stayed at many high end hotels in Bali over the years and The Legian was the best experience by far. We had a two bedroom suite accommodating my two young children, the room was huge and the kids had a ball. We were concerned about taking young kids (18 months and 3) to the luxury property but were meet with the usual Balinese love of Children. The food at this hotel outshines many of the surrounding hip bars and restaurants including the room service which is important with kids. Bali in many ways 'pretends' to understand food and dining, they are not pretending at The Legian. Whether travelling as a couple looking for a romantic break in a stunning hotel and location or travelling as a family looking to be pampered this hotel is the best in the area by a long shot. I highly recommend you spend time here, we will be going back. A class above the rest in every way.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
668,Awesome,50,June 2017,"What an awesome stay. The Legian Bali is unbeatable for its service. The warm welcome by name the minute we stepped out of the taxi was impressive, as was the fact that everyone in the resort knew us by name. They take care to remember the what your preferences are at breakfast and they really know how to make you feel at home.

The one room deluxe suite was wonderful. Large, clean, comfortable and cosy. Really enjoyed the comfortable bed.

Yoga was great every morning. Putra is a very good instructor. The spa was excellent. I had their signature massage, which was a 4-hands treatment. Therapists were highly skilled. The pool and pool service were exceptional.

Really have to go back to The Legian again. Soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
669,A classic,50,January 2017,"After almost 15 years I return to The Legian and I was not disappointed , still one of the grande Dame of Bali , service is excellent ,food fantastic .A real gem ,no requirement was too much for the staff. Even many more building, hotels and restaurants were build around ,this is the place .Will be back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
670,Awesome starting point in Bali!,50,June 2017,Gorgeous spot on more secluded part of kuta beach. Service was unreal as was the view! Location in seminyak was perfect. Away from hussle and bussle but still convenient. Concierge was great in answering all of our questions and arranging transport.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
671,Great hotel in a great location !,50,May 2017,"I recently had a pleasure of staying at this beautiful property. They are right on the beach yet, only 5 min walk to Seminyak Square where all the shops and restaurants are. The rooms are all very spacious suites and decorated beautifully. The management team and the staff take pride in their high level of service to make sure their guests will have a comfortable and memorable stay. Their breakfast buffet was great too including the alar cart menu and all very tasty. They also offer fabulous lunch & dinner at the restaurants and light menu/finger food at their ocean/pool bar. This hotel is a gem in Seminyak, away from all the hustle and bustle where you can truly enjoy what Bali has to offer !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
672,"""What holiday memories are made of""",50,June 2017,"My husband and i had an amazing stay at this flawless hotel. From the moment you arrive attention to detail is flawless the staff all remember your name which makes your stay so personalable. We spent a few days by the triple infinity pool and were spoilt by the pool staff catering to your every need! We had the 'Evolve' degustation menu it is amazing and totally recommend if you holiday here. We enjoyed our complimentary afternoon tea in our suite which was a welcome treat and a personable touch. Breakfast was a culinary extravaganza, i must say my eggs for breakfast rate the best i have ever had each morning they were cooked to perfection. The house made pastries and jams were a foodies delight. Our one bedroom suite was palatial in size and balcony ocean view spectacular. I will definitely return to this gorgeous hotel on our next visit to Bali. Thank you The Legian for providing a memorable and luxurious holiday!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
673,Sanctuary in Seminyak,50,May 2017,"We just stayed at the Club at the Legian in a roomy villa. Very convenient location with easy walks to many shops and restaurants in both Seminyak and Petitenget (note: this resort is called the Legian but is in Seminyak not Legian beach: it won't show up if you're searching just in Legian beach area).
Not that you need to walk, the club is happy to drive you anywhere nearby. In fact, they picked us up from our prior resort in Jimbaran and they took us to the airport. We had access to all hotel amenities if we chose to leave our well appointed villa. We could choose a pool: the surprisingly big one in the villa, the large one at the clubhouse or the grand pool at the hotel fronting the ocean.
The mini fridge is full and complimentary. Tea at 4:00 is gratis, as are cocktails at 6:00. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and poolside food was very tasty.
Staff are amazing. Our 'butler' Eka thought of everything and was happy to help in any way to make our stay comfortable. More importantly he is a kind, thoughtful, fun person who makes for great company. All the staff are great and are quick to find an extra way to help.
Laundry is also complimentary, a great benefit in hot, beachy climes. Spaces in the villa are generous, including plentiful closet room. My minor critiques: it's dark and I would've preferred just glass doors without the wood lattice pattern (there are like 7 doors into the villa), and the shower floor can be slippery.
Overall this is a gen of a spot. It's a little smaller than the big resorts so it may not show up on first reviews of Bali hotels. But it is outstanding, which makes it all the more amazing to discover. I would recommend this spot to all my friends and family. The accouterments are great, the complimentary details are wonderful but it's the staff that make it amazing.
Life's too short. Go to Bali, stay at the Club, get pampered, walk the beach at low tide, watch the bats at dusk, reacquaint with your loved one (and yourself), and get into the rhythm of reflection and thankfulness. That's what's waiting for you at the Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
674,Pure luxury and relaxation,50,May 2017,"From the moment we arrived, all staff members were incredibly welcoming and offered the highest level of service. Our two bedroom suite was very well laid out and suited our 4 pax party perfectly. The complimentary mini bar was a lovely touch and not often something you find in hotels.

I can highly recommend the morning yoga class, despite the rain shower and afternoon tea whilst enjoying a cocktail by the pool. Pure luxury and relaxation.

Thank you for a truly wonderful stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
675,Leading Hotels of the World indeed!,50,May 2017,"5 day stay not enough for my vacation.
Got a two bedroom Suite. I was with a friend.
Unfortunately back in New York City now.
I wish I could've stayed at the Legian for 2 to 3 more weeks.

Just take a look at my pictures. It speaks for itself.
I think this is the best hotel in the area (Seminyak).
This is an almost 5 Star hotel so you can expect 5 Star service/room/etc from it.
Everything is awesome/great!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
676,Fantastic birthday treat at The Legian,50,May 2017,"I had a wonderful stay at The Legian recently with some friends, we made the most of wonderful afternoon tea by the pool with cocktails, morning yoga and the most fantastic breakfast I have ever experienced, made even more special with a glass of champagne and birthday cake! I would higely recommend a stay here, the hotel is right on the beach and the staff hugely friendly. It made our trip hugely memorable and you will never forget the views of the sunset from the infinity pool!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
677,The Legian Bali - accommodation stay,50,May 2017,"I stayed at The Legian Bali for 1 night in mid May 2017 in a Studio Suite. From arrival I was greeted by a friendly security gate guard all the way through to warm natured bell boy staff and a reception desk team. All staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating ensuring that at every moment my questions and needs were looked after.
I was escorted to my room and shown around to ensure I was familiar with the accommodation offerings. The accommodation was simply phenomenal and every detail was perfect and in top condition. There was even a welcoming incense burning at my accommodation door upon arrival. The bed was extremely comfortable as well! The mini bar offerings were exceptionally great and quite different to the standard hotel offering which I enjoyed and simply wanted more of.
The Legian, without fail, ensure every little detail is perfect and they definitely go above and beyond making it a stand out property in Seminyak. The Legian Bali has a homely feel and you will feel at ease at all moments of your stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
678,A return visit to paradise - which didn't disappoint,50,May 2017,"So we were making a return visit to Bali & had considered a variety of alternative accommodation options. However, we kept coming back to the very positive experience on our last visit to the Legian Bali; the service, location, spacious rooms & breakfast setting were all superb, so ultimately the decision was easy & we made our return visit mid May for two weeks.

It was very much as we remembered it and from pick up at the airport on arrival to drop off at baggage checkin on our departure the service never dipped - it's personal, warm, welcoming and nothing is too much trouble.

There is good but discreet security at the hotel entrance and at beach front, ensuring a safe and private experience, as you would expect from a hotel of this quality.

Food quality & choice for breakfast is exceptional and there are good options for snacking poolside or table seated for lunch. I did feel the dinner menu was a tad limited & the dining experience for dinner could have been better on the night in question.

Service poolside is top notch without being overly fussy. Beer or cocktails are available throughout the day and 'complimentary' afternoon tea can be had either poolside or in the coolness of the AC in your room overlooking the beach.

There is a full range of amenities in the room, including music centre, flatscreen TV (with HBO), 'complimentary' snacks, beer, soft drinks, still and sparkling water in the mini fridge.

Room service including 'turndown' were very efficient, thorough and responsive. On Thursday evenings there are cocktails hosted by the management and on Sunday evenings there is soft jazz poolside.

Location wise it is hard to beat the Legian Bali - the three infinity style pools are directly beachside and there are great beach walks either side of the hotel. It is a short walk to Seminyak Square and there are numerous restaurants / bars in the immediate area. There are no shortage of taxis and Uber also operate here. It does take 45/50 minutes travel from the airport - a bit longer of the traffic is heavy. The hotel doesn't have a business centre but it is possible to borrow a laptop if you need urgent access. Wifi signal was pretty good throughout the hotel, including poolside.

So, while the cost of staying at the Legian is not inexpensive, in my view it is well worth the cost and I would have no hesitation in recommending it for a relaxing and peaceful holiday in a great setting with excellent service. Go on - spoil yourself!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
679,Truly enjoyed this hotel,50,May 2017,This hotel is more traditional and the beach is wonderful. Centrally located in Seminyak close to great restaurants and shops. I loved the complimentary mini bar items which they replenish everyday. The canopy bed adds a nice fun flare to the room and the balconies overlooking the ocean are huge. Complimentary high tea at 4:00pm everyday right at your beach lounge chair and I can swim in that infinity pool all day while overlooking the ocean. Great cocktails at the bar. I recommend the Ginger snaps. Thank you Legian hotel for a fantastic experience.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
680,Excellent hotel and service!,50,February 2017,"I had the experience of stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, the most extraordinary hotel I have ever visited. Service is perfect, rooms are very clean. View room was nice, and i did my breakfast with looked at the sea. Special for Mr GM who escorted me when I checked out. I hope I will be able to visit again in this hotel oneday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
681,Great Visit,50,November 2016,Had a spectacular visit stayed ten days would loved to have stayed longer. The staff was extremely helpful in organizing activities for us. I hope to return to Bali in the future and would think of no where else I would rather stay.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
682,PARADISE,50,May 2017,We have just returned from a superb stay at the Legian in a club villa. We have been lucky enough to stay in some amazing hotels and our stay here will rank as one of the best if not the best. From making the booking direct to leaving we were treat with top class service. Our butler Hendra was amazing and nothing was too much trouble for him even down to sorting our flight home when I got mixed up with the leaving times. The food was top class and all the staff both in the club and the hotel could not have been more attentive. I couldn't recommend this hotel more and we will definitely be returning asap.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
683,Paradise in Seminyak,50,May 2017,"We had a one-bedroom suite with amazing view and huge terrace (it was very nice to have our breakfast delivered to the room every morning - at no extra charge). We felt like we are totally taken care of and do not have to worry about anything. Guests have a complimentary afternoon tea - small, but nice detail. A lot of small-bites starters and compliments, including some sweet one before sleep. Small library with a range of books in different languages. The suites and villas are very authentic, you feel like you're in Bali in a kind of a movie - you can see it in the furniture, flowers, sculptures, and feel in the atmosphere. One more plus - Aqua di Parma cosmetics in the bathroom.
The beach. Those 3 infinity pools is really something! And the beach has very soft sand shining in the sun. Waves are huge most of the time, it is so-so beautiful that I could watch this forever! And the stuff is amazing, sometimes they read your mind.
This place is very romantic - have a dinner at the restaurant during the sunset (the best in Bali!) with candles lit up and enjoying delicios food or take a massage (amazing specialists, felt totally relaxed) and you will not want to leave this place. Ever).

We do miss the sunsets by the ocean!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
684,Bliss,50,May 2017,"Writing this on our last night in our wonderful one bedroom villa at The Club Legian. Overall - it's been simply amazing.

I want to quickly point out the ONLY two bad things:

1. As the last reviewer pointed out - they're very strangely upright about who uses the pool. We had a friend come visit us at the pool and the manager came over and told me that ""the hotel is over capacity and only hotel guests are permitted to use the pool"".... there were maybe 10 people in this huge pool area and only 3 actually in the pool. For paying $$$ to stay here, you'd think I could have one guest swim for maybe 30 minutes without getting accosted by staff. I basically had to haggle with the pool manager to let her swim for a bit. Luckily she was changing or otherwise she would have been very embarrassed by the convo.

2. The tasting menu at the restaurant was very underwhelming. I was super excited to eat here but nothing was that good... I must have got it on an off night. However, I booked a special candle lit cabana dinner that was quite nice.

The good:

Service: I won't belabor this - it is world class. I've stayed at hundreds of top hotels around the world and this ranks near the top - it's almost scary how they know where you're going to be and what you might need. Everyone is super friendly and knows you by name. Villa perks include a butler (Juni is amazing!) Free laundry / pressing. Driver service all over Seminyak. Shuttle to and from the main hotel. Oh... and free packing / unpacking service. We came back tonight and all our clothes were folded!

Quality: I don't want to leave. The villa is the most wonderful accommodation. We cancelled some activities to spend more time in it. Huge indoor and outdoor space. Mini bar fully stocked and replenished daily. Pool is amazing and private. Outdoor bathtub got plenty of use.

Would definitely stay here again. Great start to our honeymoon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
685,Terrible Service,10,May 2017,"My partner and I stumbled upon this hotel while walking along the beach looking for a nice place to have some food/drinks/swim. We asked if we had lunch and a few drinks if we would be able to use the pool and were told that we could. So after paying Australian prices for food and drinks we went to go for a swim and were told that we could not use the pool..? We advised the person who tried to stop us that we were told we could swim in the pool when we first arrived as we were having lunch etc. He went to get the manager who was not only rude but proceeded to tell us that we were lying about being told that we could swim and kicked us out of the hotel...

Its rare to have a bad experience in Bali, especially at a 5 star resort. But after the way we were treated there is no way I would ever recommend this hotel nor would I stay here. I was shocked to be treated so poorly because their staff members gave us the wrong information.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
686,Making paradise your home,50,May 2017,"I stayed with my husband for 5 days this month ...and there are no words to describe how beautiful our experience was... It was our first time to Bali, and i truly do not think we would have had the same experience had we stayed anywhere else. From the minute we arrived at the airport, till the minute we entered security check at the airport on our way back, they took excellent care of us. I have been to many hotels in many different countries, but i have not found anything to match. They were beyond our expectations. The staff are the kindest and most humble people, the rooms are very clean and luxurious, the food is superb, the hotel is beautiful and very well maintained and they go over and beyond for their guests. The location is perfect, only walking distance from popular places like ku de ta and seminyak square. Potato head is also just a few kilometers away! I will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone, wether couple, family or single, they will always be my top pick and i really do wish them, from the bottom of my heart, all the success in the world.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
687,Beachfront Gem,50,March 2017,Great Service and quality of food. One star michelin chef visited and prepared an amazing 8 course dinner with the Resident Chef and was simply flawless. Perfection in deed with wine pairing. I would do this again. Spa facilities are the best with oceanview.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
688,Outstanding hotel,50,May 2017,"This is our second stay here and it was even better than the first.
We stayed in a 1 bedroom villa which comes with club access
The villas are wonderful and spacious. Large bathrooms and outdoor bath and shower. We stayed in villa 5 which had an even bigger outdoor space than our previous villa.
The butler service is personnel and attentive, and the pool large and water temp is good. Our experience is a lot of other hotel pool villas have been small and the water has been cold.
The breakfasts in the club are also great with a lot of choices and the surroundings are very quite and peaceful.
The hotel service in general here is so good and very friendly, we could not have asked for better during our stay.
The overall winner here when staying in the villa is the service.
Suta and juni made our stay exceptional. Our thanks in particular go to Suta, as I said this was our second visit and he has ensured both stays were memorable with his exceptional and personal service. We will definitely return here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
689,Back in heaven,50,May 2017,"We have just returned to The Legian Hotel for the 2nd time. Of the 7 countries we are visiting on this trip, returning to this beautiful classy, hotel is once again the highlight. The location, the beautifully appointed rooms, the service, the happy smiling helpful staff, the food, the attention to detail..... it is beyond compare. I wish I could stay here forever 💙",The Legian Seminyak Bali
690,"Perfect, beautiful flawless service",50,April 2017,"The Legian is pricey but it was well worth it. Staff was attentive whether it was at the pool, spa, restaurants, concierge even the hotel car service was fabulous. The view was wonderful and the pool was spectacular. I initially worried about mosquitos but didn't have a single bite. The breakfast buffet was great and the Balinese coffee is nice and strong. I loved everything about the Legian and the many small touches made Our anniversary even more special. When we arrived they presented us with a lovely chocolate cake commemorating our anniversary. Every evening incense were burned outside our door. I can't think of a single thing to change.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
691,At The Legian Bali,50,April 2017,"My friend and I spent a lovely vacation time at The Legian Bali. The hotel is perfectly located in Seminyak area and its within a walking distance to the iconic bars, beach clubs and shopping area. The rooms are very spacious and the staff if very helpful and friendly. Smoked salmon for the breakfast was perfect. Lovely place, lovely time",The Legian Seminyak Bali
692,Top Class,50,May 2017,"Totally love this hotel.

The service is top drawer - 24 hours after checking in, we were called by name by every staff member. They offered a very personal and caring service. The rooms were lovely - spacious and roomy, with great facilities. Housekeeping was flawless, the rooms were kept spotless. Toiletries were plenty, and Aqua Di Parma branded, so a nice quality too.

We had a huge balcony with a sun bed big enough for 5 of us, as well as a table and chairs. The view was stunning, overlooking the beach and infinity pools.

Beds were comfortable, pillows a little soft, but this is minor as there were enough of them to be comfortable. The bathroom was huge, with a huge bath, shower, 2 sinks. Sometimes the bath drain did smell a little, but this only affected us on two occasions. We did not complain.

Breakfast was lovely - a buffet and a-la-carte menu included in our room rate topped off by the view and great service. Faultless.

There are enough pool beds for everyone, with once again attentive service from the pool men. They found your beds, laid out the towels, and really looked after us.

We will not hesitate to go back here again - in fact, we are already planning it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
693,A unique property with a great location and high-level service,50,May 2017,"This is an absolute must-experience for those looking for Balinese touch with warm hospitality and superb food. I really liked the candlelight dinner on the lawn in front of the pool and those leisurely days on the huge sun beds near the ocean. The sunsets are something really special. And if you like nice shops and restaurants, they are all within few minutes walk from the hotel. Perfect!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
694,Nice but pricey,40,February 2017,"the room was so nice, the staffs were friendly and professional. We really enjoy staying here. One thing is that the price is a little bit too high. I think i can find many hotels in Bali that has fantastic service in reasonable price.
Overall everything is great.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
695,Loved every minute,50,April 2017,"We visited Bali for the first time and stayed at the legian April 28 - may 1. The legian was absolutely perfect. I have nothing g but wonderful things to say about the hotel and it's super sweet and accomodating staff. The hotel itself is beautiful and the beach where it sits is breathtaking. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and it was exquisite and Enormous!!! Every single staff member treated us so nice. They all knew our names and we're super sweet to our daughter. The restaurant is fantastic and the chef is onsight we spoke to him multiple times. We had the 7 course Evolve dinner that was divine and the private BBQ dinner that was just perfect. They set a private table up under one of their palapas and a private chef cooks dinner right in Front of you. The spa is gorgeous and the messages are out of this world. Henry at the pool and EKA at the restaurant took such great care of us.

Thank you for making our anniversary weekend and first trip to Bali perfect and so memorable. We are already talking about coming back perhaps over Christmas! Maggie Robert and ava kite",The Legian Seminyak Bali
696,Perfection,50,April 2017,"My husband and I spent 4 amazing nights at The Legian at the end of April 2017 to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel is superb and the setting is breathtaking. The service is the best I have ever experienced -- all of the staff somehow knew my name and said hello whenever I walked by. The hotel offers free yoga every morning, which I went to and loved the peaceful class. The gym is large with 3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, machines and free weights. I didn't love the treadmills, but other than that it was fine. The rooms are clean and comfortable with all the amenities you could need. The food is delicious! We had breakfast every morning and enjoyed afternoon tea in the afternoons. I also highly recommend having dinner at the restaurant. We had a magical night with incredibly fresh food, good portions, and again, amazing service. On our final day, we had to check out at noon, but didn't have to leave for the airport until 6:30 p.m. -- The Legian kept our baggage in a room and gave us a full suite from 5:30 to 6:30 to shower and freshen up before our flight. I hope to come back to The Legian soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
697,Wonderful and absolutely beautiful stay,50,February 2017,I love love LOVE this resort! It was beautiful and service was spot on. The resort was nothing short of spectacular! The pools and grounds were huge. The spa was fantastic and loved the complimentary amenities! The hotel's ambiance was relaxing and romantic. The staff were friendly and genuinely interested to get to know their guests. It rained quite often when we were there but we didn't mind being in the hotel most of the time. We'll certainly be back soon!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
698,Classy,40,April 2017,"I just love the Legian. Our fifth visit to this beautiful resort. It just needs tweaking a little. The rooms are in need of an update. Doors to the bathrooms and verandas are getting quite difficult to move, blinds are old and dingy. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. However Evening meals have a very small menu to choose from. The quality of the food, ambience and service is impeccable.

Please educate the male staff to address women as equally as men. I felt totally ignored. They would address my husband by his name. Ask him what he would like to order
Without so much as a glance in my direction.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
699,Family Fun in the sun 20 of us for three years in a row!,50,April 2017,"Fantastic staff always friendly and helpful,big rooms breakfast menu to keep everyone happy, plenty of grassed areas leading down to the Beach.
Great for Families like ours who's age range 76years-3years perfect location for shopping restaurants surfing.Everyone voted to return again next year for more Family Fun!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
700,Mrs.,50,April 2017,"More than excellent I would say... Beyond imagination, the best relaxing holiday.
In love with the beach, sun, cool weather. Staff very pleasant. View is perfect... had been to different island but this is my favorite 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼",The Legian Seminyak Bali
701,"Old property, terrible service, plumbing issues. Not worth the price",10,April 2017,"This was my first and last time staying at the Legian. For the same rates (which are quite high), I would recommend other 5-star hotels in the region. I stayed at the resort and experienced the following:

1). Upon arrival, the hotel tried to charge me for services that were supposed to be included in my rate (round trip airport transfer and a couple's massage). It also did not honor the rate quoted by my travel agent. Despite my best efforts, we still have not resolved the issue with the hotel. I ended up paying the higher rate just so that I could stop arguing with the hotel and leave in peace.
2). The housekeeping staff tried to do turn down service in the bathroom while I was taking a shower in it.
3). The second bathroom in my suite stunk of dried urine despite housekeeping's best efforts to clean it. I think this was a plumbing issue, as this is an older property
4). Had to ask pool staff at least five times for a glass of water. However, they were very good at presenting the final bill without question and also added charges for items I did not order
5). GM tried to rectify problem just before we left. Unfortunately, it was just before we left.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
702,The Club at The Legian,50,April 2017,"Have just left The Club at The Legian after our fourth stay. It is without a doubt the very best hotel. Tim and his staff are absolutely first class. The attention to detail is unbelievable. Hendra, our butler, was unbelievably attentive, professional and caring. They meet every need of the client. From the beautiful villa, to breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails and canapés. It truly is the very best hotel we have stayed in around the world. We can't wait to return. Thank you Tim and staff. You made our stay so very memorable.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
703,Hotel perfection 😍,50,April 2017,"I'm well traveled and have stayed at many luxury hotels and this is in my top 5. What makes it so special is that everything is a high standard and it just has a really nice home from home feel about it.

- Excellent location, a short stroll from the shops, spas (check out bodyworks) or a short taxi ride away. Make sure you show the taxi the hotel card and specific locarion or they will take you for a ride (literally!).

- Really lovely pool area overlooking the ocean. I loved the double sun beds and loungers directly overlooking the ocean.

- Great food and drinks.

- The staff are so attentive and polite. Concierge in particular were excellent.

- Our room was spacious, clean and nicely furnished. Nice bathroom with a beautiful bathtub. Nice bathroom amenities (Aqua di Parma). The ocean is strong and you can hear the waves as you fall asleep which I loved.

- Loved the little touches such as incense burning outside the room in the evening, complimentary in-room snacks and the mini desserts each evening for turndown. The poems were very sweet!

I was sad to leave and will return if I come back to Bali. Excellent hotel, keep up the good work.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
704,Entertaining the guest,50,July 2016,"The best hotel in Seminyak, good service, nice architecture and interior. Good restaurant with good view. The best sunset with nice cocktails. Peaceful place in the middle of busy seminyak. Closed to shopping area.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
705,Bali Paradise,50,March 2017,"From the moment we entered the Hotel premises we knew this would be special. Fabulous room, overlooking the ocean. Refreshments included fresh fruit, cookies, cake, chips every day and a fully stocked mini bar with beer, water and soft drinks. Every member of staff knew our names and smiled all the time. Breakfast is sumptuous and while we were there we learnt that the restaurant had been awarded the top restaurant in Bali, no surprise, the food was a taste extravaganza. When we eventually decided to leave the hotel there was a good selection of shops and restaurants right outside. Thanks to everyone on the team. It was amazing..oh and make sure to do the couples Balinese Ritual massage.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
706,The perfect stay!,50,March 2017,"I went to The Legian Bali with high expectations and I didn't think it would be possible to exceed them but this fabulous hotel did just that.

We received a very warm welcome from the moment we checked in. The service from staff was outstanding, the best service I have received whilst at a hotel.

Served delicious breakfasts with eggs cooked to perfection.

The one bedroom suite we stayed in was beautifully decorated and very spacious.

The hotel is set in a prime location with most suites offering great views of beach, which offers a beautiful sunset.

A huge thank you to all the staff at The Legian Bali for the perfect stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
707,Fabulous Service! All of the staff knew your name and really went the extra mile to make your happy!,50,November 2016,"The pool's are beautiful and the location is perfect for having fun at night. It's a hotel and not a resort and lacking some facillities like golf course, etc. but every ounce of what the Legian does have is so perfect. Incredible service! Better than Four Seaons, other top brands with just the most sincerely freindly staff that really bends over backwards to accomodate you. Ask any of the staff for anything and they respond in spades. Ask for cigratte walk to your room and you will be greeted at your room or lobby by 2 people who run across the hotel with golden tray's with the finest tobacco to make you a cigarrete alog with carrying and the best cuban cigars. The bartenders make every drink to perfection. The food was wonderful and room service makes every meal an event. room service showed up with Complimentary grand champagen cognac and cuban cigars and liquor is expensive in Bali so this was really incredible. We did not bring children but would as they provide 2 babysitters per child to babysit with picnics on the lawn. The Legain is really special and I've stayed about 50 find hotel/resorts, 14 diffirent four seasons. The Legain beat them alll!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
708,Spotless Bali,50,March 2017,"Simple if your going to Bali go here!!!
Place is spotless
Rooms as good as any 5 star
Service as good as anywhere
How did they all remember my name
Just need to sort the beach, but then you have 3 lovely places to cool off",The Legian Seminyak Bali
709,Better than I expected,50,March 2017,"The property has a nice Bali feel,the staff at this property is truly outstanding,wow, they all could not do enough to make you feel special,check in was great,they escort you to your room and explain all the amenities and there are plenty.You can hear the surf roar from your room all night.The staff makes this one very special !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
710,Pure Serenity,50,March 2017,"I was amazed from the second I walked in. We were picked up from the airport by a driver that we had arranged from the hotel. We arrived to the Legian late at night from a long flight. I was in awe from the minute the driver pulled up. Everything was dim, and candle lit, quiet, and smelled amazing. Very romantic and peaceful. We were greeted with a refreshing welcome drink and they sat us down and checked us in.
We were pleasantly upgraded from a studio suite to a one bedroom suit. (thank you so much for that awesome surprise)
We were shown around and walked up to our room. The room was very large and so beautiful. Very big balcony with an amazing view. Kitchen, dinning area, living room, big bedroom, and a huge bathroom, a separate guest bathroom, and a little kitchen area.
Breakfast was great, the pool area is amazing, the ocean was really rough so we never went down to the beach but I didn't care to anyway. The pool is an infinity pool with 3 levels. They constantly walk around and give you cold water and are available if you want to order food/drinks for the pool area. The service here is amazing. They treat their guests like royalty.
We arranged a few activities with the concierge, a day of scuba diving/snorkeling, and one day we requested a private driver from the hotel that drove us to Ubud, where we went to the monkey sanctuary, the rice field walk, and a few other places that he recommended. It was an amazing day and the driver was extremely nice and helpful.
We also planned one evening at the spa. The spa was total heaven. We arrived early for our appointment to use their relaxation area. There is a hot jacuzzi, a cold jacuzzi, a steam room and a sauna, we were informed you can come use these even if you are not getting any services from the spa. Our facials/massages were great.
Our last evening there we ate dinner at the restaurant. I felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant. Amazing service, fantastic food.
The location is close to many restaurants, bars, shops, but tucked far enough away that u feel so relaxed upon coming back after a busy day in Bali. I was really sad to leave this wonderful hotel. I loved Bali, and felt this hotel experience had a lot to do with it. If I am ever blessed to come back to Bali, I would pick this hotel in a heartbeat. I would recommend to everyone!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
711,This is the very lovely hotel. とても素晴らしいホテルです。,40,March 2017,"Amazing view through from the pool, friendly staffs and scrutiny security men who checked even a bottom of the car made me reassure. If you have any problem during your visit, you should ask the kindly concierge, they can resolve your problem immediately. The staffs called us by our first names, I surprised they remembered those. And room is very neat and clean, housekeeping is perfect. However I was not sure that the restaurant did not have enough kind of food menu, I very hoped to eat local food, but the room service menu is very fulling. I would visit there again.

プール越しに見る景色が素晴らしく、親切なスタッフ、そしてカメラでクルマの底までチェックする警備にはとても安心させられました。また滞在中に何かあればコンシェルジュに頼めば直ぐに手配してくれます。スタッフの人達が何故か名前で呼びかけてくれるのは驚きました、よく覚えたなと（笑）部屋は綺麗で清潔、言うことないです。ただレストランの夜メニューが貧弱すぎで、２回は行く気がしませんでした。ルームサービスメニューはかなり充実していたので、こういうリゾートは部屋でのんびり食べるのが正しい過ごし方なのでしょう。また行きたいです。",The Legian Seminyak Bali
712,One of the best hotels in Bali,50,March 2017,"This was our fifth stay at The Legian and you simply cannot beat this beautiful hotel for a relaxing stay in the heart of busy Seminyak. Firstly there is the service. Always exceptional, from every level and in all parts of the resort. Everyone is so friendly and know you by name. As a repeat guest your previous stay requests are remembered and delivered this time also, without even asking.
Then there is the decor. Classic, classy, luxurious and all so Balinese. The room we had was a 1 bedroom Ocean Suite, top floor with stunning views over the ocean and perfectly manicured gardens. With a huge lounge area, dining table and separate bedroom with four poster bed. The bathrooms, are stunning, separate shower and gorgeous soaking bath all with Aqua Di Parma bathroom products.
Then we have the pool, all three cascade to the beach and are beautiful. The service around the pool is all brilliant.
Finally we have the restaurant and the food. This is a fabulous place to start the day with breakfast and if you get a chance try the ""Evolve"" degustation menu for dinner one night with a table outside near the pool. It is simply stunning!
The location of the hotel is also perfect, with a lane way directly out front which takes you after a short walk to Seminyak Square, so if you are wanting to venture out, it is super easy. There are so many great shops and restaurants nearby.
I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel, we made a decision from now on, we will only stay at The Legian when we come to Bali. That is how much we love it!
Highly recommended for a luxury getaway without question!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
713,Luxury Laid on at The Legian Bali,50,March 2017,"If you are looking for a resort in seminyak and your list of must haves includes, luxury laid on, ocean views, romance, an incredible location and a perfect pool - I can highly recommend The Legian Bali.

Beachfront and so very beautiful, The Legian Bali offers the best of everything.

From the lush landscaped gardens, to the enormous suites that all face the beautiful blue ocean, the 3 tiered infinity edge pool, the delicious food and amazing cocktails, the ever helpful smiling staff, i cannot fault anything. You will feel like you have stepped in to your dreamiest of dreams.

Spend the day laying by the pool - which is perfect mind you, but be sure to stay for sunset - because with front row seats at the most beautiful resort in seminyak it is one show you will not want to miss.

The spa is exquisite - i had an organic facial and massage. My skin was glowing and refreshed for days.

i cannot recommend this resort highly enough - it was dream come true to stay here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
714,Wonderful getaway,40,March 2017,"To celebrate our 25th anniversary, decided to stay in The Legian, the Club. There is a lot of privacy in the villa. But the sea view at the Hotel side is the main attraction. We have a butler and he could make every arrangement including dinners nearby the property.
But the Legian would not earn a 5 stars.

Unlike other properties around the world, the butler follows you, attending to your breakfast, needs etc. The problem is that if we choose to dine out in the hotel area, the serving are done by the hotel personnel instead of the butler. So the experience has been limited compared to other world class properties.

The concept of the Legian is quite similar to the Chedi and the breakfast at the Chedi in Ubud was outstanding. But we find the breakfast in Legian lacking. The Indonesian Cusine is really just average for breakfast. Also, the same dishes everyday.

The property, the sea view and relaxing by the property- wonderful experience

Recommendations- the butler should follow the guests whether at club or hotel
The breakfast spread - much room for improvement

Tonight is our final night and we have reserved dinner at the restaurant. Wonderful review. Hope it is good

We had dinner at Ku De Ka, and I thought it will be quite commercial. But the staff did an exceptional job to make our evening fantastic.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
715,Deserves six stars!,50,March 2017,"Wow!! I travel quite often but have never experienced the extent of the first class service that all the team at The Legian deliver day in, day out.

From arrival we were blown away, with a complimentary upgrade to an amazing huge one bedroom suite with the most amazing view of the beach and sunset/sunrise every day. Breakfast was the best I've ever experienced with an opportunity to order from an a la Carte menu as well as the buffet. I tried most things on the menu and must admit, the pancakes are the best I've ever had in my life, to die for! The amazing staff at breakfast looked us in particular Wintharti who was our waitress most mornings. Her and all her colleagues were amazing and I just can't praise them enough. They all work as a team to make sure our breakfast experience is nothing but amazing!

Then we head over to the pool where the pool team also looked after us so well. Constantly keeping us hydrated by keeping our iced water topped up and suggesting the best place for us to sit where we can get the sun. Budi, Adhi and so many of the other team were great. Every day we got complimentary sorbet by the pool area and then complimentary afternoon tea around 4pm. It's all these small touches that make this hotel so magnificent.

Special mention to Taofik, the lifeguard, who showed my cousin and I how to body board for two days. He was amazing and so patient with us, what a lovely guy!! He just offered his services and feel bad we didn't get to say goodbye to him in person as he wasn't working today. Please thank him from us as he was a super star!

All of the team at The Legian are an asset to you as the General Manager and as a hotel.

This hotel is pure class, stay here for a memorable time in Bali....it made our stay what it was - THANK YOU",The Legian Seminyak Bali
716,Escape to Heaven,50,October 2016,"As usual I needed my annual fix of beach life and this time round picked the run of the mill destination of Bali for my weekend getaway . A review of Agoda provided me with a compelling set of other choices but I settled out of courtesy to an old friend for the well established Legian Hotel set on Seminyak , as my choice of abode for this occasion . Much as there was a privilege extended to me as being , well you can say , a sort of acquaintance to the owners and you could say of course I was going to be that much more critical and demanding of the services and treatment I would expect . And the Legian proved worthy of its reputation of being that establishment hotel of the community and there was little displeasure one could levy on to my expanded expectations . The rooms were huge , well scented with invigorating Balinese incense and tropical fruits dished out generously upon arrival . The staff seem clearly trained to anticipate the insatiable needs of an exacting traveler as they mapped out very quickly the facilities to which I would now be privy to as a member of their prized guests . And of course as I walked over to the balcony I was immediately rewarded with heady views of crashing waves of the Indian Ocean , and just all of a sudden the world seemed a better place and I was ready to immerse myself into my weekend of hedonistic contentment . To describe the rest of my experience would reveal maybe just too much of the surprises in store for you but all I can say is you won't be disappointed by this time honored institution . That being said I would not have done justice however of not giving special mentions to Zaheer , who I must thank for taking time to ensure every one of my superfluous demands was attended to . The jazz evening by the beach and yoga on the lawns complimented the entire experience and as I checked out of my escapade I flew home remedied and refreshed by nothing less than the sweet and cheerful dispositions of the Legian and its wonderful team over there ! Keep it up and see you soon again !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
717,Modern Luxury in an Idyllic Setting,50,February 2017,"It was the most fantastic experience, paired with the most outstanding levels of service and brilliant amenities. The property itself is flawless, and we were thoroughly impressed with the level to which it is maintained and the level of care it is kept under - not least by the friendly locals that help keep it running both in front and behind the scenes. The location is terrific - being walking distance from all the main beach clubs, bars and restaurants. The bar has been well and truly set!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
718,Amazing / beautiful hotel,50,March 2017,"Arrived here from a rather rugged boat trip in the Philippines and arriving at the Legian was like an oasis come to life. Incredible property - so beautiful, elegant and refined. We stayed in a two bedroom oceanfront suite that was amazingly well appointed. The staff was so polite and friendly and the service that they provided was unparalleled. Highly recommend!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
719,Short stay but perfect:),50,September 2016,We stayed here with our friends who gave us a surprise gift during our short stay in Bali :) the location is fantastic. Everything is close by and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Pure Indonesian Magic :),The Legian Seminyak Bali
720,The best experience in Bali,50,February 2017,"일주일간 부모님과의 가족여행 중에 이곳을 경험하게 되었습니다. 숙박은 하지 않았고 스파와 점심식사 등 호텔 시설을 이용하기 위해 들렀는데 친절한 서비스 및 시설에 매우 좋은 인상을 받았습니다. 모든 직원들이 전부 친절하였으며, 발리 전통적인 디자인을 사용한 풀빌라가 매우 특색이 있었습니다. 다음번 발리 방문때는 꼭 이곳에 숙박하고 싶습니다. The legian gave us the memorable experience! Suwendra(spa manager) and Bagus(bar manager) has been very nice to our family. Wish to come back here for next holiday..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
721,Facing the Indian Ocean,50,February 2017,"Always so happy to return to The Legian , with its classical contemporary Balinese style and architecture. Well established palm trees, lush gardens and stylish outdoor aerea's make it a pleasure to rest and relax here. With 3pools loads of sun lounges , courteous , attentive pool staff, complementary water continually refilled allows lots of hours of rest and contemplation. Bar service is also provided , for both any beverage , snacks or meals.
The rooms are ample in size, choosing either a suite or single room, well appointed and Aqua Di Parma products replaced daily.
Views outstanding , atmosphere peaceful and relaxed.

I can't recommend this hotel highly enough! A constant and consistent favorite.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
722,Super service,50,February 2017,"The hotel staff is amazing, I had the best massage ever at their SPA. The room condition are great and concierge recommandation is awesome . The breakfast buffet quality is great (Asian and western food) tip 11am even if you don't wake up they can bring it to you in your room. The hotel facility like gym, valet service for taxi and even scooter are available for rent in case you need. The Main Street is at walking distance so you just need to walk and you find all your places.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
723,Continual Improvement,50,February 2017,"Each time we stay at The Legian Bali there is improvement. My wife and I spent 16 nights there finishing on Friday. Once again our stay was magnificent. We are amazed at the continual improvement. The relatively new General Manager Penchaud Francois has infused greater confidence into the staff and their development resulting in a more confident desire of staff to provide a high quality service for all guests. The location and facilities are exceptional. The excellent service continues to improve with such little things as staff maintaining a profile on each guest. In our case staff know what we would like at breakfast and provide it in an orderly manner maximising our enjoyment. Chef Luke MacLeod caters to our whims with a wide variety of offerings not on the menu. The room attendants, gardeners and other staff address us by name. A holiday can't get better but each year it does.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
724,Perfect hotel with a very good food 👍,50,February 2017,"We stay two nights in the ocean view suite. The suite is so big... the bathroom was the same size with the bedroom. It had living room and also dining room.

The resort was maintain very well. We love the welcome drink and the breakfast was so good . We live the eggs...the pancake . They serve ala carte and also ready food. But the ala carte breakfast is delicious. We love it.

They have beautiful infinity pool. We really love this hotel. Iys beautiful.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
725,Treated like royalty!,50,November 2016,We were treated like royalty both times we have stayed at the club! We were greeted by the manager upon arrival and departure .Our driver and butler remembered us and as well what we liked as well as my gluten free diet. The food was outstanding. (Also was the best gluten free breads & pastry I have eaten).They went above and beyond making our stay very comfortable. Our flight back to Florida was an evening flight and they were very accommodating. We have been to Bali several times and after staying at the Legian we rarely feel the need to leave the resort. It is hard to describe the tranquility and peace you leave with after a stay. We are already planning return visits,The Legian Seminyak Bali
726,Best Hotel I have ever stayed at - return visit booked already,50,October 2016,"This is the best hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying at. Everything from being greeted at the airport, to being personally waved off by the GM was perfect. The rooms are beautiful, the service in all areas is outstanding. This hotel goes above and beyond to make sure you have an enjoyable stay.

We have already booked our return and can't wait to go back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
727,Incredible!!,50,February 2017,"We stayed at the Club at The Legian Bali for 4 nights in February for our honeymoon. We did pay a little extra to stay in the 1 bedroom villa on the club side but it was definitely worth the price.

Service was incredible starting with complimentary hotel pick up from the airport. We had a later flight that was even delayed a little bit but our driver was waiting when we got there.

The villa: words cannot describe how awesome the room was. Comfortable bed, beautiful landscape, personal pool and outdoor bath. They have truly thought of everything from having iPods preloaded with lots of popular music to the fully stocked mini bar that is complimentary with the room. Each villa also comes with the services of a butler. Ary was our butler and did an amazing job at serving us breakfast everyday in our private outside dining area as well as assisting with our requests throughout our stay. I'm not sure we will get used to not having this feature at other hotels. The club side of the Legian also has its own pool and dining area. We did not use the pool since we had our own private one. We did utilize the free happy hour service at our dining area almost every night. The staff was incredible and served up delicious cocktails and tasty appetizers.

The main hotel: This is where you can actually see the beach and ocean, don't expect this on the club side. The ocean is very beautiful but not a good location to swim due to the dangerous waters. No worries as the main hotel has a triple layer infinity pool which provides an awesome ocean view. We took the complimentary golf cart shuttle over the main hotel two or three times and were still welcomed with amazing service over there. We enjoyed the Valentines dinner at the restaurant that was quite delicious especially when paired with the wine.

Overall: would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to be spoiled on the beautiful island of Bali. The price is a little high, but the service and amenities make it all worth it.

Thanks to Ary and the Legian Bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
728,A wonderful setting,50,February 2017,"The Legian was our ""home base"" for half of our time in Bali. Even before we arrived, I was impressed by the Legian. The staff arranged multiple beach club and dinner reservations for us as well as ensuring we had transport from the airport. The process was seamless.

At check-in, Julita was fabulous. She made us feel very welcome and ensured we understood all the property had to offer. The room itself was phenomenal as well.....large, spacious, well appointed. The complimentary bottled water and mini-bar snacks were very nice touches as well. The included breakfast was also top notch. I highly recommend the eggs benedict and you can never get enough Nasi Goreng either.

This property is on the expensive end of the scale for Seminyak/Legian but it's worth every penny of it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
729,the Legian Was,30,February 2017,"the Legian certainly offer one of the best location in Seminyak but this luxury hotel really need to be renovated and breakfast bit weak...

731,Consistently First Class,50,February 2017,"This is my fourth, or fifth visit to the The Legian in as many years.

In my opinion, it's easy for a hotel or restaurant to make a really good meal or provide really great service one time. But to do it consistently time after time, especially for years, that is the mark of a truly first class operation!

The Legian experience I am enjoying now is as good as it has ever been, maybe even more so.

Besides amazingly warm, friendly service, great food, especially in room service, beautiful, fully functioning facilities, the extensive list of goodies and drinks in the minibar-kitchen are free.

For me, The Legian is my favorite escape from Singapore city life!!

Try it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
732,What a gem,50,September 2016,"My wife and I spent a week here on out honeymoon and loved it. It was the first week of a 4 week trip and made the other hotels look poor in comparison. The service was excellent and the room was amazing. The pool and location were spot on. The staff were very attentive and always on hand if you needed anything. The restaurant was expensive but with so many options nearby, it was never an issue.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
733,Luxurious Relaxation,50,January 2017,"Stayed there last month during our short holiday and moreover for relaxing.
From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.
The Hotel is well located in Seminyak, close to many fabulous restaurants and bars.
The Gardens and setting of this hotel are truly stunning. We had fantastic balcony with the seaview somewhat obstructed by a big tree but still lovely.The room was immaculate, great bed and bathroom.
The large balcony had a day bed and other furniture and the room included a guest toilet, small kitchenette, free soft drinks, free wifi, great breakfast !
Staff were fantastic, very polite fabulous manners. The service was great at all times.
We really loved this hotel as it is peaceful, very comfy and every staff there is very friendly.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

When we came in the hotel i was surprised it is quiet good for the price ofcourse and the mini var in the attic was amazing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
735,Beautiful but not the best in Bali,40,April 2016,"Stayed here for our honeymoon- beautiful and great service! Our room was stunning and the breakfast was incredible. We tried the yoga one morning and it was HARD- my husband and I are both very athletic so we enjoyed it but just be aware if you think it'll be an easy, stretch yoga class- it's a workout!

My only complaint is that the bed linens were scratchy and damp the entire time. Service was good but by no means the best we received in Bali, just adequate for a hotel of this price.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
736,Great hotel and great staff!,50,February 2017,"We stayed at The Legian for Chinese New Year. The hotel facilities and staff were amazing!! Every detail was covered and it made our stay relaxing and pleasurable.

We have a two year old daughter and she enjoyed the kids club. I was disappointed at first that the kids club was just a room as I was expecting an indoor play area with slides, a ball pit etc. That said, the ladies running the kids area were wonderful and kept the kids engaged the whole time. They played music, danced, painted, colored, made playdoh, did a puppet show, made crafts, played badminton and even hula hooped. My daughter left the kids area tired every time so they definitely kept her active and having fun. Oh and they have fish ponds EVERYWHERE! They will give you fish food which tickled my daughter pink to be able to feed all the fish. That is a nice extra for the kids.

The beach is not good for swimming so you will be spending most of your time at the pool. The pool is relaxing and has three stages. Kids are not allowed in the bottom stage/portion so that is good for adults not wanting to be bothered by kids. The pool attendants are wonderful at setting up your area and keeping you hydrated.

The morning breakfast was good. There is a small buffet but the hearty part of the breakfast was made to order. The servers for breakfast were always pleasant and helped with everything we needed. My daughter LOVED their smoothies.

We loved to have a drink at sunset at the outdoor bar. It looks over the ocean and is a great view. Again, the servers are great at the bar area as well.

The size of the rooms is PERFECT! They are suites and allow for your baby to sleep in one area while you can enjoy the rest of the suite. We ordered up drinks after we put our daughter to bed and sat out on the bed and/or chairs on the balcony and just relaxed. The sound of the waves was so relaxing.

The spa is awesome! I had a massage and facial. They were very relaxing and well worth it.

There are many shopping areas and restaurants within waking distance from the hotel so you will never be bored. The streets around the hotel are not stroller friendly. I recommend a baby carrier.

I highly recommend The Legian! They have their service buttoned down and the facilities are amazing! Well done Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
737,Fabulous!,50,January 2017,"We stayed at the Club, Legian and had a lovely one bedroom pool villa.
The accommodation was immaculate, every little detail had been thought of.
Our Butler Bona was very attentive, and the entire team were so friendly.
I celebrated my Birthday during our visit and was serenaded with a great rendition of 'Happy Birthday' by the whole team, I was given a beautiful cake and delicious glass of champagne. That evening our bed was adorned with petals in the shape of Happy Birthday, a lovely end to a wonderful day.
All of the staff were really friendly.
The Chef at the Hotel restaurant & his team are very talented, I enjoyed the Discovery menu on our first night which was the taster menu with paired wines, it was all utterly delicious and one of the finest meals I have ever eaten.
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.
A massive thank you to the team, for making our holiday so wonderful.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
738,The nicest hotel ever!,50,January 2017,"The Legian is incredible. The service is exceptional, as is the view and location, and equally, the maintenance of the property, the food and the staff.

739,superb stay,50,January 2017,"I just recently spent a weekend at The Legian and i was truly impressed with the friendliness of the staff as well as the hotel itself. I stayed in one of the Suites and was amazed by the size of the suite and the amenities. If you want to be spoiled by pure luxury then The Legian in Seminyak should be your first choice. Everything was simply perfect from arrival to departure. Food is superb, wine selection one of a kind and the whole Team of The Legian just did an outstanding job making my stay truly memorable. I will be back soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
740,Heavenly!,50,January 2017,"The friendliness off the staff was beyond anything I've ever experienced. The GM welcomed us to the hotel upon arrival & we were continually called by our names by most everyone throughout our stay. The attention to detail was, again, like nothing I've ever seen. One of our favorite aspects was the amount of rooms to public space ratio was perfect; it was never crowded and we always had options of places to sit at the pool, no matter the time of day. The massages by the spa staff (at the pool) were absolutely amazing! This hotel was luxury at its best and we highly recommend it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
741,Amazing! Legian Club!,50,January 2017,"We had a wonderful experience at The Club at Legian. The villas are spacious, beautiful, and have a large out door sitting area and private pool. Our butler Dikki was professional, very helpful, and treated us very kindly. He took great care to make sure all of our needs were met and even arranged for a very late check out as our flight was departing in the late evening.
The main hotel is gorgeous, with a beautiful pool and great view of the ocean. The beach/ poolside service was impressive.

Overall the hotel is beautiful, luxurious, and private while close to Seminyak Square, making it an optimal place to stay in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
742,One of a Kind,50,December 2016,"This is one of my favourite places in Bali, once staying here the charm and beauty of The Legian will no doubt remain with you. It is truly one of a kind. From the moment you arrive you will notice the almost temple-like solid architecture, the lofty reception area, impeccable service and an ambience that oozes elegance and grace. I have stayed at The Legian more than once and have booked one of the suites that are housed in the main hotel building. Individual pool villas can also be booked. The suites are tastefully furnished; parquetry floors, spacious bedroom, comfortable bed, high quality bed linen, high end amenities, candles, water, soft drink, coffee maker, evening treats, light afternoon tea, pool side body spritz, amazing scenery, lush gardens are all part of the experience. The suite feels more like a home than a hotel and you always feel warmly welcomed and spoilt. Breakfast here is one of the best I have ever experienced compared to the numerous places I've visited at home, Europe, Asia and Pacific. The main restaurant is more fine dining while there are two smaller, informal dining spaces closer to the beach side. All offer superb ocean views of the magical sunset.
If you are celebrating a special occasion I would highly recommend staying in this classical hotel. The peaceful decor and ambience throughout, coupled with the impeccable service and attention to detail make The Legian an outstanding choice for a restful holiday where you can do as much or as little as you choose.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
743,Piece of heaven,50,January 2017,"We have been there for the 2nd time after August 2016 and stayed again at a pool villa. Unfortunately we could not avoid to leave after 2 weeks and now we are back on earth and our daily routine. I can only express a warning to everybody who will perhaps consider making vacation at The Club namely you will most likely be ""spoiled"" to the rest of you life as far as vacations are concerned...at least i cannot remember having been at a similar place where you feel being pamperered as much as here at the Club, and it will be extremly hard now to find something comparable. For sure we will be back and i am ""afraid"" it will be soon...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
744,FABULOUS ESCAPE!,50,November 2016,"My husband and I had the most amazing 5 nights at The Legian. We are regular travelers to Bali and have stayed at private villas and 5 star hotels but The Legian is absolutely gorgeous. The staff are all so helpful. Even the busy head chef, Luke, took time out to chat to us. The pools were divine and the view from the sun loungers was stunning. Don't bother looking or booking elsewhere. Can't wait til our next Bali trip.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
745,Lovely Hotel - great service,40,January 2017,"Stayed at The Legian twice in January and i love the hotel and the staff .
Fantastic suites - both the smaller and the bigger - all nicely done and in order and you are taken care off in every way - from fantastic helpfull staff to bottled water in room , warning about not using tap water - so no Bali belly here :)
Pools and pool bars are fantastic for the best sunset in town !
I will for sure come back again, when coming to Bali.

Only small thing- which is reason for not giving 5 stars is the restaurant ! restaurant is beautiful and a lot of staff, but chef have decided to only have a choice of 3 courses for dinners - i mean not a lot, when one course is fish, other are meat and third are vegie - not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel and restaurant . I can understad it, if you dont want to promote restaurant, but if you wanna promote it as one of the best in area, then you need to make bigger choice in my humble opinion - but great food :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
746,Chill out in Luxury,50,December 2016,"Second time at the Legian. Same room---really should call it an apartment it is so large, with two balconies, an amazing living room, separated with sliding doors from a large bedroom, and a huge bathroom. There is even a separate toilet/wash basin attached to the living room, and a kitchenette.
All drinks and nibbles----which are delicious---are complimentary, as is a fruit platter which is delivered upon request---every day. The Bose sound system which fills the whole suite with sound, is so extraordinary, I had to get one in my home. I read Monica E review, and I think no-one should take it seriously. This hotel and it's grounds, are not public spaces. The security and the privacy of those who stay at this hotel, is taken more seriously than catering to passing traffic.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
747,Wedding anniversary and 50th birthday,50,January 2017,"This is my fourth stay at the Legian hotel which I have loved for many years however after a disappointing start with our room request not available the Legian have gone above and beyond since then. We were moved to our perfect room the following day and from there it has gone up and up. We have experienced so many fantastic moments including a wonderful hotel cocktail party as well as unbelievable attentiveness to all of us to the point where our children have said ""how do they know my name?"".
The hotel and staff are seamless, the location is perfect and the rooms are amazing with the view, beach, pool and lawn as well as complementary goodies!
We retuned from dinner tonight to find a big bunch of beautiful flowers, a bottle of champagne and personalized cake in our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
Thank you to everyone who has made this the most wonderful trip ever and I would recommend staying here to anyone and we will be back again at our first opportunity.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
748,Beautiful Hotel,40,December 2016,"We stayed here on the first part of our Honeymoon. Very quiet and private the moment we enter the hotel vicinity away from the crowded road outside. Location wise is perfect to restaurants and boutiques. Rental of Vespa is provided by the hotel so thats a good plus not bothering to walk out and rent one. The rooms are very spacious and ours was facing the garden overlooking the beach. The pool was amazing and just nice not too crowded. All drinks in the room are complimentary. Bedroom and bathroom was really spacious. Breakfast spread was good. The gym was well equipped facing the beach and spa. We tried the balinese massage at the Spa, location was very ideal just a few meters away from the beach. Manage to fall asleep so means the masseuse was quite good. overall a beautiful place to stay, far away from the traffic of kuta and seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
749,SUPREME SERVICE,50,December 2016,"My family and I spent Christmas at The Club at the Legian. The villa we stayed in was suptious. Fantastic bedroom and a lovely living, which contained Bose music centre. Also iPod and iPad, DVD player with a gigantic selection of movies should you require them. Mini bar and snacks were free. Also the laundry (a big plus!). On hand for our every wish was Chandra, who was our butler. Chandra is the MOST efficient and friendly person you could ever meet. She organised everything for us like magic. The rest of the staff are also extremely helpful and friendly. The food is of a very high standard. I cannot recommend the Club at the Legian more highly. Stay here with confidence.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
750,Brilliant,50,January 2016,"This resort is up there with one of the best that I have stayed in. The service, facilities, room, food and overall experience was extremely good. we did not have a bad experience once during our stay. If I was ever heading back I would not think about staying anywhere else but here.
My partner and I spent 3 nights there and were sad that we had another resort to go to as we knew that there would be a very slim chance that we would enjoy it as much as we did at the Legian. We were right, we should have just stayed here longer!
Hope this helps, enjoy!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
751,The 5th star fell into the garbage,40,December 2016,"Stayed at The Legian in July in one of their lovely garden level sea facing suites. The service culture ranks up there with the very best in Bali which effectively translates to the very best in the world. This old Dame has aged gracefully and it is evident as soon as you arrive that impeccable levels of care and maintenance have been lavished on this property. The Legian's location cannot be better and unlike hotels such as The W with long driveways that require the services of a buggy, the main Seminyak thoroughfare with its myriad of shops, bars and restaurants is literally a hop, skip and jump from your room door. The raised promenade and pool areas overlooking the beach afforded lovely views and that elevated position shielded guests from the unavoidable negatives of traders and other annoyances on what is a public beach.

It is with this fond memory that i revisited the hotel in December for a walkabout and a meal. Nothing had changed except for one major issue not within the control of the hotel.

The rough conditions in Dec mean u cant safely swim in the sea. Thats just as well since the currents bring in a deluge of garbage. I kid you not when i say that Seminyak Beach becomes a repository of trash in the Southern summer months of Nov, Dec and Jan; used tampons, plastic bags, packing material and all other manner of undesirables. Not the hotel's fault but it doesn't really matter when you have just expanded 600 USD per night for the privilege of sharing your abode and views with remnants from a rubbish dump. Definitely not something to wish for on an expensive vacation.

If i had written this review in July then without doubt this is an easy 5 star rating but its difficult to overlook what i witnessed in Dec. If you're coming to Bali at year end, choose a resort on the other side of the Island. Alternatively, Ubud is quite lovely during the rainy season. Stay at The Legian during the Northern Summer months and you will be rewarded with an experience in a top notch hotel maintained to the very highest standards but come in December at your own peril. You have been warned.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
752,Wonderful and relaxing - could not ask for more,50,December 2016,Great holiday. I chose this property due to the good reviews in Tripadvisor and did not let me down. The manager and staff are extremely warm and I loved the weekly cocktails where the manager interacts with the guests. My husband mentioned about the number of keys being handed over for a room and the very next day we were given extra keys. Wish we could have stayed longer....,The Legian Seminyak Bali
753,Amazing,50,December 2016,"My family (wife and two sons 14 & 8) and I just spend 12 nights here. We couldn't fault this hotel. The facilities, the food, the staff, we all perfect. The staff were always there to help with any little detail or question you might have. They always greeted you with smiles and made you feel very welcomed",The Legian Seminyak Bali
754,Evening meal looking out over the beach,50,December 2016,"Absolutely fantastic meal. The best in Seminyak and great for a special occasion. Lovely evening with special touches and surprises from the chef through out the fabulous meal.

Steak was cooked perfectly and presentation amazing. Staff very attentive. Lovely romantic evening.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Thak you TheLegian team for this amaIng experince every year,you are the best .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
756,Dream resort in Bali,50,November 2016,"This has to be one of the most luxurious resorts we have stayed in to date. We had a Club Villa with private pool and perfect does not begin to describe it. It was immaculate and not once did we encounter an insect, other than the occasional mosquito. Our butler, Agustin was kind, courteous and attended to our every request promptly and exceeded expectations! Breakfasts in the Club area and main hotel were delicious and varied. The beach area was clean and semi private and main pools were also clean, relaxing and the staff friendly and attentive. Can not recommend enough!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
757,Superb stay,50,November 2016,"Where do I begin... my husband and I had the pleasure of returning for the second time to stay at The Legian to celebrate our anniversary. Everything was as we remembered - love the hotel, food, location and the staff! Everyone was so nice - in fact, most remembered our names! Highly recommend anyone thinking of staying here. Absolutely no regrets!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
758,Typically - Great,50,December 2016,"You always have to wonder if it will be as good as last time especially considering my wife and I had not stayed at The Legian for 5 years. Well, we were not disappointed.

Its the attention to detail and the staff that make a great hotel....and this is still a great hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
759,Perfection,50,November 2016,"Friends recommended we stay at The Legian and I deliberated a lot base on the cost per night. Well, I can say yes it is expensive but you get what you pay for. This is a first class hotel in prime location with outstanding accommodation, food and service. In fact I can not fault this hotel. Staff are attentive but not intrusive. Hear the waves crashing as you fall asleep. Staff say that 80 percent of guests are return guests and I understand why. Perfect.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
760,Amazing,50,November 2016,"Very good place for a romantic or dinner with friends or partners. Amazing wine! Perfect food, unbelievable view, BUT desserts disappointed 😔 I heard a lot good reviews about banana cake on Bali, but here it wasn't banana cake, it was just fried banana with ice cream:(((",The Legian Seminyak Bali
761,All the superlatives still don't do it justice.It's that good,50,November 2016,"We returned to Bali and to The Legian after almost 7 years of frequent visits and frankly had forgotten just how good this iconic Grand Old Lady of Seminyak is.

Remarkably we were welcomed back with such warmth that we felt like we were the only guests.

Despite being one of the very first true luxury hotels in this area and after being opened more than 20 years, this hotel still sets the bar (and very high) in classic opulence and bespoke service.

If there is a better hotel, I haven't found it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
762,"Great location, great rooms, great restaurant!",50,November 2016,"We're currently staying at The Legian and it really is delightful. This was a last minute booking for us - Qantas screwed up our flights home from Bali to Australia so at 11pm at the airport we had to make a quick decision about where to spend the next three nights - I'm glad we chose this place.

Located right on the beach, all the rooms in this property are suites - and huge suites at that. I think I've had the 2 best nights sleep of my life in the bedroom here.

There are 3 inifinity pools that step down towards the ocean and super comfortable sun loungers around the pool and positioned overlooking the beach. As you spend time there, the hotel employees that work at the pool bring you cool towels, water, sorbet and nuts.

The restaurant is fabulous (so much so that I wrote a separate review about that) but even for breakfast the options are great - it's easy to eat healthy here, or be decadent depending on what you feel like.

The Legian is like a little sanctuary away from the craziness of Seminyak and surrounding areas. But it's only a 5 minute walk to all the local shops and restaurants - it's fun to go out exploring for a few hours and then come back to this calm oasis. Highly recommended!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
763,5star standard maintained,50,November 2016,"Have just returned from another glorious stay at The Legian. I arrived for this stay a little apprehensive as I knew that there had been a management change in January. Fear not.....The Legian is still by far the best , maybe even a little better ( surely how could that be !!! ). So it remains one of my favourite places and can't wait to return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
764,Amazing Experience,50,November 2016,"3 nights stay at their 2 bedroom suites. Rooms are pretty clean and spacious, with a beautiful view of the ocean. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The property, on the whole, is relatively well maintained, sufficiently modern and yet well theme with the Balinese architectures.

A go to place if you are looking for a peaceful and quiet beachfront resort to get away. A complete wellness centre and pretty decent gym facilities. They seem to have only 2 individual massage therapy rooms.

Not a very kids friendly place, I wouldn't recommend this for those travelling with children. Would look forward to their private villa on my return trip.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
765,Astonishing,50,November 2016,"This hotel is absolutely astonishing. So many details are done right: it is mind blowing. From the service, the food/drinks to the style and interior decoration of the hotel, the unity between the hotel and the room, the location and the quality of the facilities, everything is world class.
Not cheap but a sophisticated lesson of elegance comes at a price.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
766,Lives up to it's name.,50,November 2016,"Like the many reviews already, there's just something about the excellent service and staff at The Legian. While the overall resort has started showing some wear and tear, it is only expected considering it's over 20 years old. But it is still very well preserved and is just a small issue in comparison to everything else you get. The bathrooms here are spacious and beautiful, with the rooms being immaculately cleaned with personal little touches here and there.

Yoga was excellent with an amazing teacher (I rarely say this as most resorts have sterile boring classes. Breakfast was superb with pretty much every dish tasting good, and a cute little cheese room to boot. Loved the pool area and the service you get the moment you pick a lounge/seat. Cold towels, welcome drinks, and even a cooling facial mist! Location is great! There's a quick little shortcut that brings you straight through to the Seminyak shopping and food areas, yet you're still in a relatively quiet area overlooking a brilliant beach.

Ps. Check out their website as they have really great deals every now and then :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
767,World-Class,50,November 2016,"There is a reason this hotel is one of the Leading Hotels of the World. Every local taxi driver with tell you its the best hotel in Seminyak to stay at and I really doubt there is any real competition. Not to discount any other luxury hotel but what this hotel does so incredible is sheer service at every point. I personally love beautifully positioned hotels and this one is, with three pools increasing in depth before you fall out onto the beach and the Indian Ocean. Lit by fire pits at night and glowing candles, this hotel exudes atmosphere and an outstanding restaurant. The staff excel, the service just so wonderful. Beautiful great hotels never deserve an excellent rating if the service doesn't match. This does.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
768,Romantic restaurant,40,October 2016,"It's located in a nice hotel. Restaurant is right next to the beach so has a very nice view. It's a very romantic place.

Staffs are so friendly.

Food is good but not excellent. Potion is a bit small even it's fine dining. We ordered the duck but it's a bit dry and rough.

Overall it's a good spot but don't give too high expectations of the food:))))",The Legian Seminyak Bali
769,We fell in love with The Legian.,50,November 2016,"This is our second time staying in this hotel. We enjoyed our 3 nights stay at two bedroom suite. Everything is nice, lovely, clean and service is outstanding. The hotel provides housekeeping service twice a day, in the morning and afternoon. Breakfast is top of quality and excellent. Facing ocean view from the room is amazing. We enjoy the swimming pool and playing in the beach. There is none that made our stayed uncomfortable. Our flight is in the evening and they allowed us to stay in the room until we left for airport in the afternoon. The staff has demonstrated excellent service. I strongly recommend this hotel and will come back again. We have been staying in many hotel around Bali at Nusa Dua, Jimbaran and Legian with same rating but none could compare to consistent service provided by The Legian at seminyak. The housekeeping staff is honest and trustworthy. We could have peace in mind to leave our valuable stuffs (jewelry, watch, ipad and laptop) on the table in the room unattended.
I would like to give appreciation to the hotel management for being able to provide such an excellent and consistent service delivered by all staffs. Keep up the good work!

770,Amazing,50,September 2016,"It's impossible not to give The Legian an excellent review. I have stayed there twice now, and it is everything that other tripadvisor reviewers say and more.

The service is very, very good. Attentive and genuine without being pestering. The food is extraordinarily good, the breakfast in particular was a delight each and every morning. The coffee is not great, but consistent with what you get generally in Bali.

The room was a touch on the sterile side. We stayed in a two bed ocean view suite. The view was spectacular. It was very quiet, we did not notice other guests at all, and the room was always immaculately clean. But I return to the word sterile - the walls were a very stark white, nothing really to warm them up by way of wallpaper, flowers or artwork, and the night lighting could have helped this also. All in all, a minor gripe.

The poolside area is where it's at, and we spent most of the day here. The poolside food was excellent, although the drinks (cocktails in particular) were very hit and miss - some well made, others poorly balanced. Again, this is symptomatic of everywhere I have been in Bali. I think they just don;t know what a cocktail should taste like. But the surrounds are spectacular - I have never been to Ku de ta or potato head, the reason being is the Legian is just as good minus the crowds and bogans = much better. No need to leave, just find a quiet lounge at sunset and watch the sun disappear.

The beach outside the Legian was not great while we were there - to rough for our daughters (7 and 9) to swim by far, and not enjoyable at all for swimming. Lovely for a morning stroll before a hearty breakfast, though.

Some nice extras I should mention. It was my wedding anniversary whilst there, and a bottle of champagne and a chocolate cake arrived at 8.00pm, a very nice touch. They also ran a baby turtle release activity where children released baby turtles into the sea - a highlight of the trip.

All in all, I will be back to the Legian one day. Once you have stayed there, where else could you go?",The Legian Seminyak Bali
771,Our stay at the legian,50,November 2016,We stayed 5 nights at the legian and have beautifull memories about our stay. Rooms are very clean and with all comfort. People have eye for detail and are so helpfull and kind. Haven on earth !!!! During our stay at the beach we got free cold water and an icecreme treat. Breakfast has all you can imagine.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
772,Beautiful hotel,50,August 2016,"We stayed at the Legian as we had a night to spend in Bali after a driving trip to Alor. We love the Chedi in Muscat and both hotels belong to the same group. While the Legian is not as visually stunning as the Chedi, it is still very nice. The rooms are huge and very comfortable. Spa was nice and food is good.
Would definitely stay there again if we need to be close enough to the airport.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
773,Perfect getaway,50,November 2016,"I had been rock climbing in West Papua and was in dire need of a relaxing break. The Legian Bali does not disappoint. My partner met me here and we stayed for four nights. Every day has been so relaxing, the food, cocktails, service, spa, and private dinner were exemplary. The staff did not miss a beat and surrounding Seminyak was fun to walk around and shop. I have never been so relaxed on holiday and we will definitely return for another stay. The hotel is right on the beach and there is even some good surf in the morning before the Seabreeze sets in. Yoga is great to get the day started and is included as is the buffet breakfast. Best Bali trip ever.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
774,Luxury in Seminyak,50,November 2016,"We recently stayed at The Legian for 5 nights. It was a lovely, quiet and relaxing hotel in the busy Seminyak area. The property was extremely well looked after and all of the staff we encountered were friendly.

The infinity pools on the beach front were picturesque and were a great way to sit in the warm water and people watch the passers by on the beach.

The food was all of a very high standard and could not be faulted, including the breakfast Buffett, pizza by the pool and dinner. The room was luxurious and spacious and perfectly clean.

I had read some reviews on trip advisor mentioning that the rooms were looking tired- I did not see this at all and we are fussy travellers! The Legian takes great pride in their hotel and the rooms could not be faulted, including the twice daily servicing.

Overall it's a great luxurious hotel and is highly recommended for those seeking an oasis in the busy Seminyak area. You don't need to leave the hotel grounds at all.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
775,Autumn Holiday,50,October 2016,"We really like this place, they organised the pick up from the airport, sorted out our rooms, originally on the 1st floor, but we wanted a better ocean view so were allocated an larger room on 2nd floor. Not that the first room was in any way other wise inadequate. Lots of amenities in the room, fruit, iPod player plugged into Bose sound system etc, plenty of bottled water. Room service was fab, not that we used it much as the in house restaurant is excellent, breakfasts in particular. Great pools, there are 3 over looking the ocean, plenty of loungers and towels with ready supply. The largest pool is circa 33m so good for moderate exercise. Through out our stay, (4 nights) the service was excellent with staff making the effort to know your name and refer to you using it. the hotel also provides good recommendations for local restaurants (lucciola, just along the beach being one of them) and shopping which proved to be very reliable for us. All the rooms we saw faced the ocean, ground level there are some very pleasant gardens, the first floor the ocean through the canopy of palms, the 2nd floor is mostly above the tree line and the 3rd floor is above the tree line which then may obscure the gardens.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
776,Absolute Luxury,50,October 2016,"I have been to some incredible hotels over the years but The Legian has now become one of my all time favourites. Everything in this hotel is pure luxury and the service is second to none. It has all the elements of a great five star hotel, but what really makes the difference here are the little touches. From burning incense outside your bed at night and the poem left beside our bed each day, to cold towels and water by the pool, and complimentary daily afternoon tea, you will not want to leave this place once you arrive!
Breakfast is a large buffet with lots of options, and all cuisines are catered for at lunch and dinner. My husband has allergies and nothing was too much trouble for the restaurant staff or chefs, and they went out of their way to ensure we were looked after.
The highlight of our stay was taking part in the hotel's 'Save the Turtles' programme, where we released eighty baby turtles back into the sea. An incredible experience to say the least!
We loved every second of our stay here and it's safe to say we'll be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
777,Paradise!,50,October 2016,"A luxurious hotel with the most exemplary service. Staff so helpful, friendly in a perfect setting in a perfect location. The view from our suite of the pool flowing into the sea was heaven. We did not want to leave.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
778,A wonderful oasis in Bali,50,October 2016,This resort is absolutely amazing. One of the top resorts our family has stayed at. The pictures don't do justice to the grounds or the view. The sound of the surf at night is so soothing. The staff are 5 star...go out of their way to assist and help. When our flight was delayed several hours they immediately helped extend our checkout without any problems! We stayed in a fabulous 2 bedroom suite...kids say it was their favorite hotel. Pool was amazing.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
779,Superb hotel,50,September 2016,"Our deluxe suite was spacious and equipped with every comfort and modern electronics.
The hotel is very well maintaineda and magnificent in every aspect but the mos striking aspect was the service which was really unparalleled.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
780,Great experience!,50,September 2016,"Great food, service, and atmosphere. Put this in your ""must"" list and enjoy the fantastic food.

Be prepared to overlook some incredible views too. Do also take a taste of some of the great cocktails on offer (but I'm sure you already planned to).",The Legian Seminyak Bali
781,Fantastic service,50,October 2016,"I spent 5 days at The Legian and was very impressed by the Hotel and service. My room was a lovely deluxe suite with lots of space and a comfortable bed. It had a huge terrace on the ocean with a comfortable day bed.
There are special touches around every corner. The bar is stocked with drinks and snacks, bottles of water all over the room, turn down serves and snacks every day. Breakfast was a buffet with lots of good options. Several places to sit outside, around the poor or near the ocean.
I went to the spa every day for an affordable massage. the service and staff at the spa were great too. Most massages at Hotels are OK at best, but I can say the massages here were some of the best I've ever had.
What really stands out is the service at the hotel. It's impeccable.

The only negative I have is minor. The gym is a bit small and somewhat outdated. The sauna, steam and jacuzzi are shared, and I think they'd get more use if they had separate male/female facilities.

If you want Pure luxury in Bali you can not do better than The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
782,Beautiful hotel,50,July 2016,Fabulous accommodation with great service. Well maintained; superior staff; worth the cost. Would definitely stay on return trip to Bali. The location is within walking distance of shopping and restaurants.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
783,Perfection retained,50,October 2016,"Last year, I was leaving The Legian with a somewhat heavy heart (see my previous review): I was concerned if the legendary outstanding quality of this place could be sustained by the then management. When I was checking out this last Monday, my mood was quite different: the good old Legian is not just still with us but it moves on very strongly fully retaining all these essential truly luxury notes that make it so unique and special. I congratulate the new management on that most sincerely and full heartedly.

The level of service is still outstanding and beyond any description or reasonable anticipation. They do still remember what you like to have for breakfast and what particular type of beer at what particular time of the day you enjoy on the beach - and the last time you ordered those was more than a year ago but they do still remember. The concierge desk still remembers what sightseeing trips you booked with them last year (and a year before) and greet you on your check-in with a suggestion of another one, which will so well complement the ones you've already taken because it is of the same theme and nature as them.

The rooms are still spotlessly clean and inobtrusively and almost invisibly serviced twice a day. You still enjoy your complimentary afternoon tea either on a beach, or in your room, or in a beach bar with the gourmet petit four that come from the restaurant. The outstanding level of service is still unbelievably uniform - one can hardly single out any particular employee as they all demonstrate full professional and personal excellence. To achieve such a uniformity is extremely difficult and, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I'd have said impossible, it is a triumph of thoughtful and professional management.

Many sincere thanks for their outstanding performance to Pering, Merta, Alit, Budi, Oka, Eric, Giri (beach pool boys), Cetrawan, Dayu, Winrathi, Henry (pool bar & restaurant waiters and waitresses), Heri, Lou (front desk and concierges)... I hope I spell their names right. Special thanks to chef Luke whose attention and engagement made my two weeks at The Legian a very special experience.

To be a returing guest and being attended by them is as much a privilege as it is a true pleasure.

I already look forward to being back. Hopefully, in not too a distant future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
784,Top notch,50,September 2016,"This is a case of you get what you pay for. On the pricey side, but really good. Possibly the pick of hotels in Seminyak.

1. Rooms are large and spacious, apartment sized, light and airy (stayed in deluxe suite)
2. Food actually isn't too expensive and is of a high quality. Plenty of other choices outside the front door as well
3. Gym is ok, quite large for a hotel gym, mostly machines but does have decent free weights.
4. Surfboard and boogie boards available for free to guests, conveniently located with the lifeguard.
5. Ambience / atmosphere very nice and chilled.
6. What sets this place apart is the service. We did go during a low week just before school holidays, but still, staff were so genuinely warm and attentive.
7. Not a huge resort pro or con?

Main pros: staff, quality of food, room size ++.

Cons: The only real criticism would be the outrageous and I mean that, cost of wine. Laughable. Unbelievably expensive. Just thinking about it makes me laugh.

The resort could do with some other simple sporting activities like a table tennis table ... would be cheap.

We will be back though, due to the overall quality of the place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
785,Great place to eat,50,September 2016,"Great restaurant !!
The terrace in front of the sea is beautifull.
We had the tasting menu.
Food, wine and service are really good.
The chef is creative and the food looks amazing in the plate.
I highly recommend",The Legian Seminyak Bali
786,"Amazing hotel , staff , food",50,October 2016,"We just had an amazing trip and stay at the legian
The chef Luke is amazing , food was awesome and the whole stay perfect !
Amazing location too
Just great !

Thanks the legian team, you have been amazing !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
787,Beautiful hotel,50,October 2016,"Stayed 6 nights in 2 bed suite. Looks so much better in flesh than photos
Nothing to fault at the hotel. True 5 star. Superlative service throughout.
The pool area is delightful and sun beds cleverly set out on platforms so as never to feel crowded
Would not hesitate to recommend the hotel",The Legian Seminyak Bali
788,"Luxurious experience, to be repeated",50,October 2016,"Get one of the rooms on the top floor, overlooking the ocean, order a satifsying breakfast to have it on the balcony. Not even necessary to leave the beautiful pool and beach. An extremely relaxing and luxurious stay in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
789,Simply Wonderful,50,October 2016,"My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary together with our daughter so we opted for the two bedroom suite. From the ease of advance arrangements for transport from the airport to our final departure after five nights we could not have been happier with our choice of accommodation. The Legian is a fantastic beach front property with three large infinity pools overlooking the surf and sunset. Our lounges and day beds by the pool were stocked with cool towels, endless cold water and refreshing sprays for the sun burned parts. Our breakfasts were varied and delicious. When we wanted to venture out the concierge was always able to help. The girls enjoyed the ocean view spa for some relaxing massages and we enjoyed dinner in the pool bar. Throughout our time the staff called us by name and were exceedingly attentive. Even the koi in the pond would greet us daily. I cannot give more than five stars but I would if I could. Thanks to the management and staff for making our special week extraordinary.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
790,Great! Wonderful! Beautiful! Perfect!!,50,October 2016,"It would really be hard to say enough about The Legian. The property is just gorgeous. As good or better than the photos. Really just awesome. The pools, the beach, the views from the rooms. All just gorgeous. We were upgraded to a top floor deluxe suite from a studio, but the studio would have also been great. The location is perfect. Quiet but just a 5 minute walk to many restaurants and bars and another 3 minutes to the entire ""eat street"" area. Also easy to get to any other part of the Kuta/Legian area. The service was also fantastic in all areas, from reception to house keeping to the concierge and restaurant. In every area they are attentive but not intrusive. The hotel is very responsive to emails and requests to set up events (in our case golf at Nirwana) and really just wonderful for all our requests. The food and service at the main dining room and the pool areas and room service was fantastic, and the prices were extremely reasonable, quite a difference from most 5 star hotels! The breakfast buffet is wonderful, and in addition to all the usual buffet items offers made to order eggs, French toast, pancakes, waffles, etc. For us this hotel was just perfect, and if you are trying to decide whether it is worth the extra money as opposed to some of the less expensive resorts in the area, IT IS!!! And if your trying to choose between The Legian and some of the others in the same price category, the thing I'd say is, The Legian is designed as if the rest of the island was built around it. In other words, it is designed in traditional Bali style (as opposed to some of the other ""name"" hotels we stopped into for a peek), and for us that design and layout and landscaping and spaciousness added so much to our time in Bali. As for the room itself, really lovely, thoughtfully designed, roomy and extremely comfortable. The complimentary juices, sodas, cookies, chips, nuts, etc., and the daily treats that appear are such a pleasure, both for the convenience and just the nice feeling that you aren't being nickeled and dined for every little thing. The wifi works well property wide, but if you find yourself using it often you might want to reconsider how you are using your time at this amazing property! I can't think of a single reason not to stay here, and we are really glad we chose The Legian for our entire week in Bali. The views from the balcony and the pool are forever etched in our mind, as is the roar of the waves crashing against the shore. The rooms (all of them) are really perfectly situated so that the sound of the ocean is easily enjoyed in the room if that's what you want (we did) but not so loud that anyone would have a hard time sleeping. Indeed, we left one of the sliding glass doors cracked so we could hear it more, but even with the door closed it was easy to know you were next to an ocean. The villas, on the other hand, are across the road and while we never went into them, my guess is they are not within earshot (or view) of the ocean.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
791,The legian,50,June 2016,"clean, friendly staff, food, excellant facilities including spa and massage onsite. Excellant resort everthing you need without leaving the complex. breakfast, dining couldn't fault. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend",The Legian Seminyak Bali
792,A planned holiday with family,30,September 2016,"Being our first trip to Bali this was certainly a great experience. As we had not been out of Australia since 1990 it was certainly a worthwhile experience.
We went as a group and was not sure what to expect, but after checking in we decided that we had made the right choice.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
793,"Perfect , they understand the word hospitality",50,October 2016,"My husband, 17 year old son and I stayed for 6 nights. We booked two rooms. The rooms are huge , perfectly clean and so appropriately decorated for the beautiful setting. Super clean, great beds. Nice fruit and nuts in the room. Great vieuw on the ocean. (they all have). Our son could surf right in front of the hotel. Staff was amazing, the maintenance of this hotel is perfect. Its 20 years old, so they know what they are doing, but they renovate and improve constantly. So, new showers, no compromises made. And a genuinly friendly staff, anything goes.. Walking distance of some great clubs (Potatoe head) and restaurants ( some good chefs at Urchin) , but very quiet and tranquil on the property. You can have a romantic dinner in the restaurant, or a nice drink at the bar, with fingerfood. Quiet though. The only minus that Ive seen was that a very hairy gentleman was not told to put his shirt on during lunch at the pool restaurant. So, in short, this is one of the best hotels Ive seen, I saw a lot.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
794,Very nice,50,October 2016,Great hotel it does little thing like tastes of fruit every night at turndown that we didn't get at our other stops. It's location is great for walking around town. Closeness to the ocean is wonderful. As far as the other reviews saying it was a little warn it wasn't a thing that I feel should be of concern in selecting this hotel.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
795,Magnificent! Sensation! The only place to stay!,50,October 2016,"Location is perfect, as you can walk to the main strip of shops and restaurants if you wish. However grabbing a cab for $1 is just as easy. The service is 5 star, rooms are exceptional, the three pools are magnificent. There is no other place I would stay in Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
796,"Well worth considering, I'd definitely book again",50,October 2016,"Short version of this review; Book the Legian, you'll love it!
A little more information; my Wife and I decided (after quite some deliberation around which property to stay at) to book The Legian. Well, simply put we could not be happier with our choice.
The property is located on one of the nicer stretches of Seminyak beach & has been here for 20 years. The key element here I would emphasise is that it feels 'established' not 'old' in any way. There is a level of authenticity in the rooms, building / grounds and most importantly of all, the wonderful staff.
You will be welcomed as an extended family member & will not want for anything during your stay.
There are newer resorts, or more 'funky' with day clubs etc, but this place is where you should consider if you want an upmarket & relaxing stay. After all, there are a whole bunch of funky restaurants and bars within a few minutes walk from the property.
The rooms are exceptionally well maintained, very roomy and classic in design. The air conditioning also works a treat, which is important in this part of the world. A higher floor is not essential as they are all lovely, but might just provide a less interrupted view of the ocean.
With a three-tiered infinity edged pool, there is plenty of room for all guests, young and old without anyone getting in your way.
As already mentioned, the staff at this property are what make it special. We met several employees who have been around for at least 10 years & their enthusiasm for offering world class service shows.
If your considering staying in Seminyak, I'd recommend considering The Legian for your trip.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
797,Bliss,50,September 2016,"I love this hotel. Our stay was wonderful. Every member of staff made us feel special, they remember your names, do everything with a smile and make sure everything is perfect for you. We celebrated a birthday and anniversary and were treated so wonderfully with cake and champagne.

The hotel is in an excellent location on the beach close to shops, restaurants and bars. If you do want to take a taxi anywhere they are so cheap but you really don't need to go too far!

We stayed in a studio suite which contained a huge and very comfortable bed, a living area, bathroom with shower and bath, a pantry area with a nespresso machine, tea, coffee, kettle, fridge and sink, a balcony with lounge chairs, table and chairs. They do their best to make sure your stay in mosquito free with repellent available free in the rooms.
Soft drinks and water are provided free in the rooms, you also get fruit and a treat every evening. There was a cocktail party one night where we enjoyed a few complimentary drinks and snacks.
The breakfast is wonderful, the menu contains everything you need and you order and get hot fresh breakfast, delicious fruits, pastries, juices, smoothies etc.
This hotel welcomes children so its not child free if that is what you are after, but if you don't mind that or have a family its perfect for you.
The gym is small but excellent with high tech equipment and plenty of towels, water etc. There is a steam room, Jacuzzi and sauna.
Thanks for a wonderful stay and memories.
The only slight issue was the noise from the ocean, the waves are very loud and the balcony doors and windows are not sound proof. I didn't mind this too much but my husband struggled a little.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
798,Best hotel I have ever stayed!!,50,September 2016,"Wow this hotel was everything we expected and more! We stayed in a one bedroom pool villa and enjoyed the benefits of being in the Club! Out butler ""Diki"" was fantastic and attended to all of our needs and beyond - I wanted to take him back to Hong Kong with me :) The service and facilities were exceptional and we fully re charged our batteries not having to think about anything!! I will definitely be returning to the Legian ASAP!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
799,Beautiful Legian Club delivers on all promises,50,July 2016,"We stayed in one of the sumptuous but highly practical one bedroom pool villas for a blissful summer recharge. Staff were charming throughout, especially our attentive but never intrusive butler, Agus, who added an extra element of service to what is already a well-honed set up. Free top ups of delicious snacks and in-room spirits are just a few of the unexpected and generous hotel bonuses that this regular business traveller knows are sadly rare. Excursions happened seamlessly with minimal stress and direction. After some recent experiences with overbusy pools, the 'lonely' Club pool was blissfully tranquil, with drinks or snacks always a moment away, if wanted. The hotel helped enormously with Emirates' shoddy baggage return after a 4-day hiatus; goodbye Emirates!
Seminyak itself was busy, but always fun and friendly; a high standard of restaurant at surprisingly reasonable prices, and a host of shops, cafes, and bars. We'll be back, despite the 15 hour flight, just not with Emirates!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
800,Perfection on the beach front,50,September 2016,"My wife and I booked to visit this hotel mid-September 2016 for part of my 50th birthday. We booked a deluxe suite overlooking the ocean and were not disappointed - it was a fantastic room.
The staff were all fantastic and so attentive - even down to a birthday cake and bottle of bubbly.
The weather was magnificent for this time of year - hot in the day and occasional fantastic storms in the evening.
The infinity pools leading onto the beach front and the ocean was my idea of heaven.
The hotel restaurants are also fantastic too for breakfast through to evening. And it is also very close to the town.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
801,The right hotel!,50,September 2016,"Wow what a hotel everything and more. The room was top class ! spacious and welcoming! everyday fresh fruit sample and Balinese sweet to sample. Television if you wanted it. The bathroom was a joy with everything well appointed. Afternoon tea served to you on the beach or by the pool was a treat everyday. The staff were courteous and efficient. The hotel is well situated for a short walk into Seminyak . Seminyak has everything for everyone if you want to leave the hotel. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to families, old folks like us or honeymooners everyone is catered for..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
802,Best club visit anywhere,50,September 2016,"This was my wife and I's 11th visit to Bali but our first to The Legian.
We stayed nine nights in a club villa.
The villas are wonderful with a good size pool, outdoor bath and Bali hut. The villa is also very spacious. The villas come with the best butler service we have experienced in any of our villa holidays. Chandra our butler made our holiday even better with a level of service you could not surpass. Thanks again Chandra for making our stay so special.
The breakfasts in the club had a large selection and were of great quality.
The club comes with high tea and afternoon cocktails. It's a very relaxing area that provides great food and service.
Other services that the club provided were
complementary mini bar, local transport to restaurants to name a few. Chandra ensured everything from our dinner arrangements to our laundry was looked after, we didn't have to think of anything!
The club and villa were so good we didn't use the rest of the hotel facilities a lot but the pool areas were good and the two pool bars provided a great spot for nightly cocktails. The service from all the staff here I could not speak highly enough of and are a credit to the management .
The hotel location is good and you can walk to the Seminyak shopping and restaurants in a few minutes.
Our experience here set a new level of quality and service for us and we highly recommend this hotel during your stay in Seminyak.
We will definitely return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
803,Wonderful week,50,September 2016,"This was our second visit to the Legian. As so many of the reviews have stated,
this hotel is wonderful. The staff are amazing and every little detail is thought of.
From the food and service at the amazing breakfasts, to being looked after by the pool, everything made our stay one to remember. We were in a one bedroom suite on the top floor.
Our son and his girlfriend joined us the the last 5 days and we all agreed that this
hotel has everything.
Although a long way from the UK we will definitely be back again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
804,2nd visit,50,September 2016,"We love this hotel. There is something very special about it, much more than the fantastic beach location near some great restaurants. The team do an amazing job of making every guest feel like royalty. Everyone that we encountered went out of their way to give us a memorable experience.

We stayed in a one bedroom end deluxe suite, the same as our last visit. It's stylish, spacious and very comfortable with lovely Acqua di Parma products in the bathroom.

The quality of food from Luke's team from the amazing breakfasts( try the eggs benedict), lovely lunches by the pool to the brilliant menus for dinner were all first class. The discovery menu was exceptional!

The team at the pool were great, special service, chilled water and cool towels all day.

My husband had great fun with Taufik the lifeguard with the body boards and he was so caring when he managed to hurt himself in the water.

The Legian is a superbly run hotel, we can't wait for our next trip.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
805,Unforgettable Dinner!,50,September 2016,"We were not staying at The Legian, but nearby, so thought we'd drop in for sunset drinks and perhaps dinner.
The pool bar served great cocktails, with the best view of the beach we'd found. Extremely friendly staff and the offer of joining them for dinner, made our choice to stay easy.

From the moment you enter the restaurant it's like you are the only diners there, the staff were so attentive and enthusiasm about there menu, we were captivated, throw in the million dollar view and it has it all!!

The meal was amazing, my husband ordered an entree, and not to have me sitting there without anything, they bought me out a delightful cucumber cool soup that was delicious.
We followed with mains and desert. Breads of course are complimentary.

In regard to price, it sits the same as places such as Ku De Ta, but the service and setting are considerably more up market. The Australian born chef came out to our table and chatted, clearly proud of the entire establishment.

This was one Restaurant we dined at twice for dinner. We highly recommend The Legian!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
806,Six stars plus...,50,September 2016,"My wife and I spent 3 glorious nights in a one bedroom suite here before moving to another part of the island. This was our first time at The Legian and won't be the last. We are used to staying in luxury hotels and this is equal of the best. What we found amazing was the level of service. Every staff member seemed to know us by name and always knew when we needed something, even before we knew we needed it. The funniest day was when I decided to see how long I could stay on the day bed. I made it 3.5 hours before I needed a swim. In this time I had lunch, a one hour massage and a couple of drinks. We will be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
807,Paradise in Bali - Luxury at its best,50,September 2016,"Spent a week in Legian Club, Villa 9. Absolutely wonderful. Staff were so helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Our butler Yoni was marvelous. Complimentary snacks, soft drinks and alcohol, refilled daily. Complimentary cocktails 6-8pm, complimentary car service wherever/whenever we wanted.
The service was superb, can find no fault with anything during our stay there.
Definitely recommended",The Legian Seminyak Bali
808,Classique,50,August 2016,"We spent a blissful week at the Legian at the end of August. Considering our penchant for upscale boutique hotels it was very nice to see for ourselves that hotel rightfully enjoys the renommee of one of the best hotels in Bali.

So let's dispose of basics like professional service, vast rooms, cleanliness, top of the line furnishings and supplies; these things are a given in hotels of this class and are present, generously and in a most salient fashion, at the Legian. What really matters is experience such a hotel offers and the way it makes you feel. The location and the view from our room were dreamy. The grounds are a delight, manicured and stylishly low profile.

The Legian is effortlessly chic and opulent without ostentatiousness. There is Elysian air about it; right after settling in, you effortlessly and happily slip into the delightful routine of enjoying life. Everything at the Legian is where you expect it to be and the way you want it to be. If you want something to be different to suit your whims, the hotel makes it happen, effortlessly and graciously. Dining and wining are scrumptious in all (diverse and numerous) formats, from breakfast to dinner to afternoon tea and amuse-bouches served randomly and nonchalantly throughout the day. And we absolutely loved the Ocean and Pool bars :-) A holiday to remember, with a smile.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
809,World Class Luxury,50,September 2016,"We were first time travellers to Bali but not strangers to luxury accommodation and the Legian was outstanding on all counts.

There is the option of staying in the hotel or across the road in a villa at the Legian Club (which we chose). I'll list just some of the highlights.

- a gorgeous villa with its own pool, two outdoor couches, two outdoor loungers, padded outdoor dinning, an outdoor bath. Indoors was gorgeous with heaps of storage, a 4 poster bed and plenty of power points.

- The rooms in the villa were dark at night and the air-conditioning fantastic ( a slight noise but the best we had on our trip). Easy to get to sleep.

- The room came with complimentary snacks, soft drinks and alcohol refilled daily

- An iPod was connected to a great sound system with hundreds of songs

- Laundry was done daily, for free (excluding dry cleaning)

- Wifi was fast, easy to connect to and we only had to enter the password once during our stay for each device.

- The club offered free afternoon tea from 4pm - 6pm, FREE cocktails from 6pm - 8pm and an additional 35m pool just for club users

- All hotel facilities were available to club users including plenty of pool side sunbeams, a fantastic restaurant for dining and for the complimentary breakfast (extensive menu)

But the best comes last - service. Second to none world wide. Our personal butler took fantastic care of us including laying frangipani petals on our bed on a special night for us. The car service was exemplary.

We were worried about mosquitos in bali but here where were nets, complimentary spray and the room and outside were sprayed daily, it just was not an issue.

We could find no faults here.

If you want luxury privacy but the ability to also enjoy people watching and atmosphere at the hotel with fantastic amenities and services treat yourself to they wonderful experience. Could not be matched!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
810,The best!,50,September 2016,"A wonderful hotel. So many thoughtful actions: By the beach - iced water, cool towels, spritz spray, sorbet and fruit tasters; spiced nuts and cheese sticks with drinks; In room - nuts, cookies and crisps daily, poems and flowers on bed, delicious toiletries, oodles of bottled water, daily fresh fruit and night time sweet treat. No stone is left unturned in the pursuit of making your holiday just perfect.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
811,Amazing Honeymoon,50,September 2016,We stayed at The club - Legian a couple of weeks ago for our honeymoon.. Everything about this hotel is perfect. our butler couldn't be more helpful but never intrusive. The service overall was excellent. The beach front pool area in the main hotel is simply stunning with 3 large infinity pools it never feels crowded.. we would 100% go back to this hotel.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
812,Just delightful !,50,September 2016,"We have been fortunate to stay at The Legian a few times now, each visit we always want to plan a return trip - this visit was no exception.

The staff are an absolute delight - attentive but not in your face, and always looking to ensure that they help to make your visit special.

The quality of food and options at breakfast, lunch and dinner - whether at The Restaurant or poolside are just terrific, with evening dining at The Restaurant a real treat with premium ingredients beautifully presented and lovely flavour combinations.

It's great that they have a pool just for adults...but also another two pools suitable for everyone. Many hours were spent in the infinity lap pool overlooking the beach and the sea...just mesmerising.

The hotel is in a perfect location - walking distance to many Seminyak favourites such as Ku De Ta, La Luciola, Potato Head and many more....but to be honest, whilst there are so many great places to visit that are close by, it's also easy to just hunker down and not leave as The Legian has so much to offer.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
813,Always impressed,50,September 2016,"Just had an idyllic 10 days. This is one hotel that def delivers on the promise and we have been coming for 10 years. The restaurant and new chef luke is amazing, the new GM professional and friendly, and staff fantastic in every respect. We travel a lot and this hotel remains our favourite. Thanks for another wonderful experience. We will be back xx",The Legian Seminyak Bali
814,Not recommended for families,20,August 2016,"What to say about a 15m2 sq. Room (fishbowl) managed by 2 babysitters and definetely not entertainers, with an obvious lack of envy, sympathy and energy to entertain kids?! A huge disappointment regarding the kids activities which are definitely not satisfactory despite a given daily program. Kids were getting in circle and quickly bored with drawings and paintings and any effort have been done during our stay (10 days) as to try to improve this inconvenience. We have been shocked by the reaction and words of the General Manager, Mr Panchaud who litterally walked away from our claim regarding this topic. We are used to travel 3 times a year in luxury hotels and must admit that this is the first time ever that we notice such indifference. The only answer we had was to encourage us to go outside in some paying playgrounds (30 min drive go and back) or to pay extra costs as to make some entertainers come. Unbelievable for an hotel of this standing! Obviously a management that forgets to encourage clients satisfaction and repeaters. Which is a shame for a LHW! We had the occasion to discuss with other families and the feedback was the same.
On the contrary, the positive point everywhere else in the hotel was the very nice staff who always did its best to please us, in striking contrast with the attitude of the GM.
A beautiful spot but a boutique hotel with an unsufficient structure to welcome families for long stays.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
815,Stunning beachfront property,50,September 2016,"This was our first time in Bali and with so many choices of hotels and villas to choose from, we decided to stay at The Legian Bali. The top floor 2 bedroom suite was amazing with wonderful sea view and nice spacious area for our family of 2 adults and 3 kids. The kids enjoyed the top tiered infinity pool tremendously as well as feeding the fish and different activities offered by the hotel kids' club everyday. Thank you for the wonderful service and hospitality.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
816,Truly 5 star,50,August 2016,"After much deliberating, my wife and I chose the Legian as part of our honeymoon in Bali and what a great decision!

From the moment we entered, we were treated like royalty and the room was glorious. People have mentioned that the hotel looks a bit tired and perhaps you can tell that slightly but the inside/rooms/dining and pool area are stunning.

The rooms feel like home and both the bed and bathroom was amazing. Aqua do Parma toiletries were also a very good touch.

The food is exquisite and we dined a couple of times and had room service. Chef Luke has created some fabulous dishes and the wagyu sirloin was incredible. Breakfast is also extremely good, with plenty of choices to your preference.

Gym equipment is decent for a hotel and the complimentary yoga was also very good. Both my wife and I had massage treatments and whilst you of course pay much more than in Bali, they are incredible and in luxurious rooms so money well spent!

What truly makes this hotel is not the rooms, fine dining or pool area but its staff. I find the Balinese in general to be some of the most genuinely kind people I've had the pleasure of meeting and everyone from the cleaners, receptionists, through to the pool attendants and beverage manager were superb and made our stay perfect.

Thank you to everyone at the Legian for giving us the perfect week....we only wish we had more time.

Mr and Mrs Holman",The Legian Seminyak Bali
817,Very nice place,40,August 2016,"Very enjoyable stay, lovely friendly staff. The only disappointing factor we had was that one night there were children crying and fooling round at midnight next door. We contacted staff that night but nothing was done about it. The same thing at 6 the next morning. When we again contacted staff they indicated that we could switch rooms. I explained to them that we had been there for 4 nights and had another 3 nights to go and we should not have to be disrupted because we had noisy neighbours. They should have looked at dealing with the problem.
Also it would be much cheaper using the blue taxis, rather than the hotel taxis as you will save at least half the price.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
818,Outstanding,50,August 2016,"Truly outstanding, from the wonderful staff, to the huge studio suite with two balconies looking out to the beach, to the amazing restaurant and three infniti pools. This exceeded all our expectations and we'll be back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
819,Peace of Mind,50,August 2016,"Our room was upgraded to a two bedroom suite, which was unnecessary but due to high occupancy this is what we get so we accepted, it was just Huge.
The moment you stepped into this place, you know already that The Legian is different than any other hotel in the area.
I like how comforting, homey and peaceful vibe the hotel could offer.
They respect our privacy which I respect back highly. Staffs are not over friendly, and when we asked for something, it was immediately done without hesitation.
Love the pool, Love listening to the wave of Seminyak and breakfast is simple but very good. They put mosquito's incense in front of our door to shoo all the unwanted bugs.
If you feel lazy to go down for breakfast, it can be served in the room as well and its included with the suite. I believe people who come to The Legian are mostly regulars and they know their routine everyday; Breakfast, Relaxing by the pool on the sun bed, Lunch at Pool Bar or from your sun bed, back to relaxation mode, swim a little until the sun about to go down, back to their suites, getting ready for dinner and a night out around the chic Seminyak area like Metis, Mamasan, Sarong, Shanghai Baby, Bistrot, etc ...
On our check out day, one bell man was very kind to help me packed our Pies to a box, he went the extra miles to look for the box which suited our Pies (we bought quite a lot) LOL I am almost sure the bellman's name is Tugus. Knowing our flight back was at 2145hrs The Legian gave us late check out until 1700 hrs. This was surprising and very helpful to us and also we could enjoy more tanning and we got to experienced the Spa, little lunch with champagne etc. This was Lovely and always been Lovely. Hope to see you soon The Legian :) Thank you for your hospitality!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
820,We loved it so much that we came back again 2 years later,50,August 2016,"The Legian is a wonderful hotel in a great location with excellent facilities and a fantastic restaurant and Spa.

Having spent 5 days out of a trip to Bali and Gilly T on 2013 we planned our entire stay in Bali this time at The Legian.

The main reason being because we loved the service and the superb restaurant and their Super Chef Luke Macleod.

Coming back 2nd time presented some worries on the flight, would it be as good as last time? having placed all bets on this location this holiday.

We need not have worried, it was every bit as good and we used facilities this time which we had not before. The spa is beautifully created with great facilities, gym, spa room and then a wonderful team to administer the treatments - highly recommended.

We had a corner suite with a balcony and day bed over looking the ocean!

The Restaurant under Chef Luke is amazing, during our stay we managed to sample everything on the dinner menu as well as the incredible tasting menu ""Discovery"" and finished our last night with ""The Intimate BBQ"" which was a fabulous evening to compete our holiday""

The ambience of the resort is very relaxing , with attentive non intrusive service. The pool and ocean front gardens area contain Day Beds and sunloungers with attendants and 2 bars serving snacks and cocktails with waiter service is open

If you want to crank up the vibe there is an excellent beach Ku de TA 5 mins along the beach.

The Legian deserves the high ratings it receives a great location, great facilities and a Super Chef and superb staff.

Worth a stay",The Legian Seminyak Bali
821,"Amazing hotel, great location!",50,August 2016,"We stayed at the Legian for 5 nights at the end of our 12 night honeymoon in Bali and it really was the perfect way to end our trip. Initially I had concerns that this hotel wouldn't be as special as the others as it was much larger and not as boutique as the others but all my worries disappeared as soon as we arrived and actually for a number of reasons this ended up being our favourite one as everything is just perfect! The hotel's infinity pools lead onto a beautiful beach with beach bars close by. The hotel staff were lovely, so polite and friendly going above and beyond in their service. The pool staff and restaurant/bar staff were especially great. The hotel is well positioned to be able to walk into Seminyak town, Seminyak square and with beach bars such as Potato head and Ku De Ta really close by however the hotel itself is calm and relaxing so you really do get the best of both worlds here. We plan to come back to Bali and some point in the future and The Legian would be our number 1 choice to come back to. Thank you for making the end of our honeymoon so special!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
822,Location is great but you stay here for the service,50,August 2016,"People write about what they love and hate in their reviews. My review is on exceptional service. Having stayed at the Legian Hotel, where everyone knows your name, we were spoiled all week with wonderful massages, fantastic concierge service and beautiful sunsets.

We were on our last night in Bali. Flight was due to leave at 1:25am so we decided to have a 9pm dinner at Sarong and depart directly to the airport from the restaurant. While in the car to the airport, our driver received a call from Sarong notifying us that we had left our credit card at the restaurant. Sukma at Sarong asked what time our flight was to leave and promptly sent an employee (Dharma) on a motor bike to the airport. Simultaneously, our driver called the Legian representative, Sukarat (I'm sure I'm butchering the spelling of his name), who is usually at arrival waiting for guests to arrive.

When we pulled up to the departure entrance, Sukarat was there helping us navigate the airport while coordinating the credit card swap with Dharma. While we checked in, Sukarat met Dharma to get our credit card and brought it back to us in short order. We made our flight with time to spare and are forever grateful for the exceptional service received from Sarong and the Legian Hotel.

We deduced that Sarong had to connect the dots on which concierge made the reservation, call the hotel to then call our driver. Our driver was on point and made the choice to use the hotel's resources at the airport. It was flawless. We have said and will continue to say that what separates Bali from any other beach destination is the fabulous Balinese sincere and caring service. People are authentic and work so hard to make sure our time on the island is a wonderful experience. We thank the Legian Hotel and Sarong for such exceptional service, especially Sukma, Sukarat (sincere apologies if we butchered your name), our driver (huge hug to him!) and Dharma. Thank you!

Other notes:
The Legian Hotel is amazing. Beautiful view, clean, tidy, everyone knows your name, concierge is incredible, eager to serve, authentic and sincere, exceptional attention to personalized detail, trustworthy (we left our safe open, they closed it and told us to call for the code). We doubt we will ever find such wonderful service at another hotel.

Sarong: wonderful food, loved the crispy pork belly and green curry. We went over board on ordering and the manager comped one of our vegetables because they felt they allowed us to order more food than we could eat. Amazing. Great ambiance, clean while comfortable and obviously, exceptional service.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
823,Bliss on the Beach,40,August 2016,"Initially I was quite worried that everything looked a bit old and worn in the hotel. The rooms were tired. Repair was needed. But, after 24 hours those thoughts totally disappear and all you can see is the calm, serenity and total relaxation of the place. It's old yes. But it's totally professionally run and makes you feel relaxed. I have never felt so relaxed at such a beach resort hotel.

The staff are non intrusive and excellent and the food is great. The setting is glorious. I would stay here again for sure. Thank you Perchaud (GM)

824,Service Beyond Compare!,50,August 2016,"We have recently stayed at The Legian Bali for 14 nights for our family holiday What an amazing experience! The decor is stylish and timeless, the rooms are spacious and we had a lovely view of the well manicured gardens and the ocean beyond. The staff here are amazing, for us, they are what made our holiday so memorable. The service level that they provide is exceptional. From the first morning the staff knew our names and couldn't do enough for us. When we went for a swim in the pool, our towels on our comfortable poolside bed were organised and folded for our return. Water is constantly replenished without having to ask. Complimentary afternoon tea was always a treat with savory and sweet delights that differed daily.The poolside bar offers delicious food, my children loved the pizza. The infinity pool, like everything else is clean and well kept.
The spa is delightful with a selection of treatments on offer from experienced therapists I had a facial and massage and both were first class.
Would I go back.....most definitely!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
825,THE CLUB AT THE LEGION BALI !!!,50,July 2016,"We have recently stayed at the Club for 6 nights and had an amazing time. I also agree with all the other great reviewers, it is really true that every member of staff knew who we were, how we best liked our drinks, food or any other little things requested. Nothing was ever too much trouble and our amazing butler Mr. Ari was a true gem! The service is extremely professional, the villa just what we wanted, the food was outstanding and being a vegetarian it's not often you find this amount of flexibility and imagination to cater for our needs. My son was very well taken care of, a few nights he decided to do some night swimming in the large pool and Mr Ari arranged mobile lights for him to enjoy the midnight laps. Now, this is what I call service!! All in all I cannot recommend this place enough. After that we went to two other 5-star resorts in Bali and they were all truly disappointing in comparison.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
826,Important Warning !!!!!,20,August 2016,"Although their website advertise on the ""unobstructed views"" or ""unobstructed sunsets"", you should know that this is a totally false advertising.
A lot of rooms are facing a wall for exemple, a lot of rooms have no view on the ocean or at most a very partial view ... but all rooms are at the same price !!

To be short, attached are the photos of the view i had in my room, which i paid 1,500 usd / night. No more comment is needed i think.

For 1,500 usd / night, my room could even never see the sun, not to speak about the ocean or the sunset ... Look at the photos and see what you actually get for this price !!!

IMPORTANT WARNING : what you see and read on the website is ABSOLUTELY NOT what you get (except the price).

My recommandation : avoid absolutely until their pricing policy is revised with just a little of basic hotel management. No hotel would make you pay the same price when your room faces a wall or has partial or full view on the ocean.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
827,Simply Outstanding,50,August 2016,"We have travelled the world (113 countries) and usually stay with Leading Hotels of the World - this hotel would have to be one of the best we have ever stayed in - irrespective of the price (value for money was excellent). The main reason for this rating is the outstanding service. Their attention to detail is impressive. For example, we stayed in the villa section across the road from the main hotel, yet everyone in the main hotel knew our names (don't know how they do this!). Regardless of eating venue, they were always aware of the fact that one of us had a gluten allergy (they had a fantastic array of options to eat). You are greeted by a warm smile and professional service throughout the venue.
The poolside restaurant run by chef Luke McLeod from Australia is Michelin Star worthy. The gym is well equipped and the free yoga classes at 8am very professional. The spa massages were excellent. Despite being 20 years old, the design is timeless and the property is extremely well maintained. The Villas are just stunning with a Bose sound system with speakers through the villa, another Bose ipod deck by the bed and complimentary mini-bar and extensive snacks. The bed was bit firm for our tastes but rectified by a mattress topper. The pool/sun area is great. Above all else, the club service from breakfast to complimentary afternoon tea and evening cocktails was outstanding. Many of the staff have trained at the Setai Hotel in Miami. We must make a special mention to our Butler Arisna, who left us wanting for nothing - always anticipating, never intrusive and extremely professional. We'll be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
828,Perfect!,50,August 2016,"Amazing place and perhaps the best hotel I have ever stayed in! Rooms are very spacious and luxurious. Minibar and snacks in the room are complementary, which is a nice touch. In general the amenities at the Legian are plentiful and generous. Breakfast is great! The pool area and the gardens are beautiful and very well kept. The staff is extremely service minded and friendly and they actually learn the names of every guest! So impressive! My husband got very sick with salmonella the last day we were there and the staff in the restaurant went out of their way to help us, by booking a doctor and giving us food to bring on the plane.

The food at the hotel is very good!! We had been a bit disappointed with the food at other hotels during our stay, especially Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay, so this was a very welcome surprise! We attended a special events dinner and a manager’s afternoon cocktail the days we were there. On both occasions we were very happy with the wine and food offered by the hotel. (Bali can be a bit disappointing if you love wine but the Legian offers a great selection!) I would like to commend the young and very nice and knowledgeable sommelier at the hotel!

The hotel has a well equated gym and complementary yoga. I had a few sessions with the resident personal trainer which were very good. Recommended if you want a break from sun, food and wine.

In conclusion the Legian is amazing! It is not possible to fault this place and I only regret not staying longer.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
829,"Like vintage champagne, this resort still effervesces",50,August 2016,"It's 20 years old, no scratches, tarnishing, wear and tear.......just like a well cared for masterpiece, this wonderful resort has significant charm, maturing with age, protected by a stone wall but inside, it's all Bali, not dissimilar to the days when it was born when the traffic flowed outside.

Still, heavily ensconced on the day bed on the verandah in our spacious accommodation overlooking the beach, one can only hear the silence of the staff and the pounding of the waves, the latter doing what it does best without disturbing the senses.

Staff- beyond perfection with constant greeting and name remembering. The resort is nearly full and yet all guests are remembered. Many are long term employees and understand the operators philosophy.
Food- stylish and well presented down to the last detail. Love the size of the table napkins. Enough for two faces!
Pool- there are three infinity with one flowing into the other and the other flowing into other other.
Sun lounges and Day beds- all comfortable with no blemishes, large towels to go around large people or two thin ones
The Concierge with her newly acquired Clef d'or keys is a fountain of knowledge.
Overall, no complaints, no regrets. Just worth it all. Go on, spoil yourself!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
830,Perfect,50,July 2016,"We had booked 10 days at a Club Villa at the Legian for our honeymoon after four days in Ubud. It was exactly what we had hoped for and more. From the moment we arrived we were given first class service from absolutely everyone. The Villa we stayed in was perfect and luxurious, with our butler Sande who was amazing- nothing was too much for him.
Everything was so flawlessly organised and staffed at every point and we were amazed at how many people would greet us by our names everyday- even though it is a small hotel we thought it was a nice touch. There was always enough space for everyone- never a struggle to find a table, sunbed or waiter. In fact, you get guided to the best sunbed and get towels laid out for you every day, then bought an ice cold water and refreshing cold flannel. These little things really made you feel special.
Breakfasts were brilliant, in the club lounge and also across the road in the main hotel where they served a mixture of buffet foods and cook to order choices. We enjoyed afternoon tea on a day bed watching the sunset on the beach, with the different pastries and savoury treats every day. Then in the evening we could get cocktails or wine bought to our room or have them in the lounge bar and they would bring canapés out every time- changing every day and always so tasty. If that wasn't enough- every time we arrived home from our evenings out we would find a little sweet treat under a cloche.
I had my 30th birthday out there and got to meet Chef Luke, telling him my likes and dislikes, he created a special tasting menu for us to have and it was so delicious, it felt really special and was a big highlight.
You are so close to lots of shops and restaurants that you can walk or get dropped off by a butler. We had some amazing meals, in particular Chandi, Metis and Sansaka.
The only negative about the whole holiday was my husband suffered from a bad bout of Bali Belly while we were there and got the Dr out who was brilliant and gave him a jab which helped very quickly. The staff really looked after us by asking how he was doing and bringing us plenty of bottles of water, plain rice and chicken noodle broth. So it was the best place to be poorly as you were well looked after.
I couldn't fault anything on our 10 day stay at the Legian Club Villa, perfect honeymoon and 30th birthday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
831,Outstanding quality,50,July 2016,"Had the most wonderful stay at this gorgeous hotel. Yoga on the lawn - fab. Pool and beach beautiful. Staff - so friendly and helpful, including the very personable General Manager. Restaurant and quality of food - superb. Didn't want to leave.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
832,Seasoned Boutique Hotel.,30,July 2016,"We stayed 4 nights for a family reunion. Lovely suite with rich Balinese touch and spacious indeed. A little kitchenette next to the foyer, a nice addition to the suite. Although interior seems a bit outdated but acceptable. Personal Butler is always available at your service which is also nice. But honestly the choices of food is so limited that we ended going out for lunches or dinner outside the hotel. Strategically located in Seminyak..walking distance to shops and restos..love it! For the value of it...I would rather stay next door. A newer resort with the same facilities, great breakfast buffet. Perhaps the older generation would prefer The Legian. Overall, it is still a lovely hotel but need to revamp on the interior and F&B.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
833,HEAVEN ON EARTH,50,August 2016,"First of all thanks very much to all the staff of The Legian Hotel for looking after us on our entire stay till we checking out today. You done a very good and excellent service. Well done 👏👏👏

This is my 3rd times staying in this beautiful hotel and 1st time for my friend. After spending a nice week in Ubud my friend asking me to choose a nice hotel for spending a view days before heading back home. He gave me 2 option of hotel The Oberoi hotel or The Legian, I don't have to think twice I than say The Legian as I was experienced a nice time here. Then we check in after and staying here. My friend was speechless with the service, the room, the food, the location, he think this hotel is one of the best hotel in the world. The price of the room can not be comparing with their High Class and Elite services which is at other place you must pay an extra to have all those excellent service.

Thanks The Legian for offer such amazing experiences to us, especially to my friend. We will definitely come back.

See you soon... 👏😎

834,FLAWLESS,50,July 2016,"Hubby and I decided to head to the Legian for a sunset cocktail (were not guests at this hotel) and I am so very glad we did.

We entered from the street entrance (not off beach) and were unsure how to get to the bar (this is a very large hotel). I approached a lovely lady at reception and she personally escorted us through the hotel to the bar area.

she seemed a little bit put out when I first asked how to get the bar which was odd given how polite and friendly I have come to know the Balinese hospitality workers to be.

Turns out she felt terrible because she thought hubby and I were guests at the hotel and she was mortified she couldn't place us!!!!

After our personal escort to the bar area, we were given a choice of two bars, but very helpfully advised (suggested) we go to the main bar, not the pool bar as the latter was due to close in less than an hour.

Our delightful guide personally sat us and brought wait staff over to ensure we were immediately looked after.

Ordered a couple of cocktails (very reasonably priced) and they came with huge dish of cashews and bowl of breadsticks - so good value in all.

The hotel is truly beautiful. So elegant and with exquisite artwork throughout.

Views from the bar for sunset - well what can one say.....

If the level of service we received merely having a sunset cocktail is anything to go by, then I will seriously consider staying here next time in Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
835,Unbeatable service orientated resort,50,July 2016,"We recently stayed for six nights in a bedroom suite with our two adult sons. From arrival to departure the service was second to none. Every request was met, including room preference and late checkout (particularly appreciated as we had a very large amount of luggage after spending time in Europe prior to Bali). Staff are exceptionally well trained and extremely helpful, service with a smile. We had to request a doctor for one of our sons (who flew in from Australia with a chest infection). This was organised straight away and medication ensured he was on the improve within 24 hours. The pool area and service is the best I have ever experienced. Being addressed by name is a wonderful personal touch. The manager, Panchaud Francois, is present and his influence is the obvious reason behind this hotels reputation which is even better I dare say since it changed hands recently. If you are ever going to splurge on a five star experience, do it here!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
836,Relax Relax,50,July 2016,The hotel although changing ownership this year has continued to provide exceptional service and delivered on our expectations. This was our second stay and we left on this occasion feeling satisfied and relaxed after a great stay. The location alone is worth the visit. The beach and closeness to shopping and restaurants made it a centrepiece for our holiday. We stayed on the upper floor and had a great view across the palms to the beach. The staff are friendly and more than willing to provide outstanding service and made our stay memorable. We had a great relaxing holiday and felt pampered and special.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
837,Unbelievable,50,July 2016,"After a bad start to our Bali holiday we thought hang the expense and book in. Yes it is expensive but worth it.

The Legian is definitely up there with the best in the world. It is getting old but this place has such a good feel it could be 100 years old and still be great. The attention to detail is outstanding. Staff that I have not seen before know my name. Management deserve credit for the way this Hotel is run.

We have a 2 bedroom suite which is bigger than a house. Only complaint so far is the bed is a bit hard but I am sure they will fix the problem.

The pool area is unreal. It is directly onto the beach. No need to leave this resort. If you do it is within walking distance of all the go to places.

Yes, I am still at The Legian until the money runs out. Who cares.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
838,Paradise boutique hotel on the beach,50,July 2016,"What an awesome boutique style hotel in Seminyak. The staff is so friendly and professional. The breakfast is a lovely buffet style and you can also order anything else. We stayed with our 2 kids in the deluxe studio suite 212 and 213. Beautifull spacious rooms with a big and cosy balkon overlooking the sea . When we arrived they surprised us with a bottle of champaign and a 20th anniversary cake. The hotel is also right next to a great local market, nice restaurant and nice shops. Every morning you can do the yogaclass from 8 to 9.30. After that you can still enjoy the breakfast. The pool is beautifull and clean. Sea is beautifull but also dangerous. Nice for surfing and jumping in the waves. Stay in front of the hotel because they have good lifeguards. Besides the small buth good bar/poolrestaurant (try the satay and grilled baby squid)they have 1 main restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every day the chef Luke MacLeod offeres breakfast, lunch and dinner in a various healthy pleasant way
All the staff is verry nice and helpfull, very clean rooms (3 times a day) great location. We have seen a lot beautifull 5 star hotels,but this hotel is definately one of our favorites.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
839,Celebration in Style at Center of Seminyak,50,July 2016,"Visiting Seminyak, Bali for a special moment...I chose to stay at the heart of Seminyak where The Legian - Bali provided me all that I need.
From the best beach view from every suite and very large cozy room size ... I made the right decision to celebrate my birthday here.
The pools facing the beach are so refreshing...every morning I look forward to enjoying me time. The streched beach is also very good location to jog. And every morning there a complimenatry yoga class.
I am so blessed and I feel healthier💕.
The culinary from morning to evening are superb. Specially at night, from watching sunset and listening the piano live music...my dining experience turned to a magical moment.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
840,Consistently outstanding,50,July 2016,"As regular visitors to Bali over many years we sometimes make the mistake of trying one or two other hotels before heading to the Legian. Despite a change in manager (from GHM to LHM) there's been no negative impact on the facilities or staff. In fact with recent renovations (subtle makeovers of all rooms, improved pools, gym, spa and just opened plunge pools, steam room and sauna) the hotel has never looked or been better. It's hard to imagine staff could be better trained or more empathetic (should that be telepathic?) to the needs of guests. The setting, the architecture, the food, the gardens, all are beautiful (even more so at night when lit with hundreds of candles). When combined with the exceptional staff, the proximity to all that Seminyak offers (great alternatives to the superb hotel dining options are a short stroll away), why would anyone go elsewhere for a beach holiday in Bali? We'll be making a booking for 2017!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
841,Home away from home,50,July 2016,"The Legian is a beautiful hotel. It's in a great location for Seminyak restaurants and boutique shopping. The pool overlooking the beach is amazing, we normally would go to potato head or kudeta, but didn't even need to leave the hotel to get a better experience. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which was huge! Having a two year old with us it was great to have extra room to keep him entertained. The rooms are beautifully presented and small touches like staff all knowing your name, deserts delivered with turn down service and complimentary tea coffee and soft drinks all day pool side make the hotel really stand out. Pricey but great if you don't want to leave the hotel!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
842,The Legian is Over,20,July 2016,"Ive been coming to this hotel for many, many years now and always considered it the only place to stay. Sadly, that is no longer the case. With the recent departure of management group GHM, who have some of the highest standards in the industry, as well as the recent change in hotel general manager it is obvious that the hotel has lost it's way.

The rooms are old and tired. From the sewerage smell that wafts from the drains in the toilet to the smell of rusty pipes from the bathroom sinks, its so sad. Don't hang your clothes in the closets, they'll only smell of rotting wood and you go out smelly musty. The television signal is poor...it made watching the Wimbledon final a challenge. Grainy, fuzzy pictures. The maintenance guys tried their best but clearly it is out of their control.
Once upon a time bouquets of tuberose were in abundance around the hotel (stairwells, outside rooms, in the rooms) but now you'll only find one in the lobby. This cost cutting measure only adds to the old and musty smell that wafts around the hotel grounds. The hotel is showing her age and she is in dire need of some TLC.

The food at the hotel, once noted for its high level has also taken a turn for the worse. Despite the qualified Australian chef who I can only imagine is trying as hard as he can with limited resources at a hotel that's lost it's way. I sometimes measure hotels by their club sandwiches....The Legian was famous for its club, ive had conversations around the world about how good the food was here....sadly what you get now is on par with eating at your local cafe, not that of a five star hotel. The ambience in the main dining room is boring and stuffy and the food is overpriced for what you get. I only ate at the hotel and got Bali Belly. Ive never had Bali Belly after a decade of visiting the island and it goes to show that standards have slipped.

What made matters worse was the immaturity and ignorance of the new hotel manager who, when I brought my concerns to his notice, laughed, ignored me and continued to talk about the other hotel they are building on Lombok....clearly where his priorities lie. I decided to leave early and move to the Four Seasons at Jimbaran which was an amazing remedy to my disappointing experience at The Legian. I suggest travellers consider it.
When the manager was notified of this, he had the audacity to tell me 'I'd be back' and didn't even apologise for the experience I had.
Well, I can confidently say that I wont be back to The Legian, and wouldn't stay there if it was the only hotel on the island. I definitely wont be back whilst he is still there, driving it into the ground.

I understand the Club may be different and for those who have never stayed at The Legian before, they think it's great. But if anyone has any history of visiting the hotel, I'd be surprised if they hadn't noticed a decline in standards.

It must be mentioned that the Balinese staff and managers at the hotel are still amazing and some of the best on the island. They went above and beyond to assist me and it was obvious that they are facing challenging times with an inexperienced and incapable general manager. For the sake of the lovely Balinese staff and the hotel itself, I hope the Indonesian owner of the property takes note and gets the hotel back on track to being one of the best on the island.

For so many years when I was asked for a recommendation to stay in Bali all I said was 'The Legian' and now I can no longer confidently do that, which is a shame. Perhaps its the over-development of Seminyak. Maybe its the hotel's age. Yet, as an experienced traveller and after experiencing the general manager's flippant and dismissive attitude towards a guest who has stayed so many times before, I believe the responsibility rests on his shoulders.

The hotel has dropped in standards and the prices have continued to climb. For the same rate I was paying at The Legian I got an amazing villa at the Four Seasons Jimbaran which leaves The Legian in their dust.

To anyone considering staying at The Legian I suggest you do your homework and investigate other options, should you wish to stay in Seminyak, which itself is a mess. Maybe once the madness moves to Canggu, which seems to be the way things are heading, Seminyak will return to being the place it once was. The Legian however has a lot more work cut out for themselves and throwing their efforts into the new property on Lombok, to the detriment of The Legian, is not the way to go.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
843,"One of the best in the world, if not THE best",50,May 2016,"Our 10th stay at The Club at The Legian, managed by the excellent and totally client dedicated Timotius. The butlers team is wonderful under Widastra supervision.
There are no words to express how wonderful, amazing and incredible it is.
Villas (and rooms) are perfect, food is stunning, and service is at the top, probably the best in the world.
You enjoy every second here.
You can not wait to come back.
Every staff member know your name and what you like. When you sit for breakfast the staff remember the juice and coffee you like and how to serve it to you.

When it is time to leave you just think about when to come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
844,"Nice place, but not great value",40,June 2016,"Pros:
* Service is fantastic. Many staff knew our name and remembered our breakfast orders. Concierge service before and during stay was great.

* Pool area is fantastic. Many sunbeds available. 3 different pools so can always escape the crowd.

* Hotel grounds beautiful – just like what you see in the photos.

* Spacious rooms, very comfy beds.

* Huge bathroom with great toiletries.

Cons:
* Rooms are starting to look a bit old. Broken blinds and scuff marks are the norm. Rooms are quite dark for most of the day. I’d suggest rooms will need a big renovation in ~ 1-2 years.

* Requested a room on a high floor, but Received a room on the first floor (out of three floors). Enquired about moving but was told no in a nice way. Surprising we could not have a higher floor, given the hotel was only 40% full. Acknowledgement of the request and why not possible is best practice I would suggest.

Other thoughts:
* Probably the best hotel in Seminyak. The W is a party hotel and good for younger folks.

* If you like privacy you want a room away from the pool and reception area, otherwise everyone can see your balcony. Some rooms are on the ground floor with almost no privacy, would not want one of these – they’d be dark as a cave.

* Location is good. You could walk to some places, however, streets are very narrow and walking seemed a bit dangerous – especially at night. Taxis are cheap and a better option. Walking up the beach is good to do once, but not too much to see.

* The ocean in Seminyak is too rough to swim in a lot of the time.

* The cost differential between Club and Hotel is not much (~$150-200/night)– I would suggest Club offers a much more luxurious and private experience. If I stayed again, would go Club for sure.

* Quite a few families with kids stay here. That surprises me, as it is quite “stuffy” compared to most beach hotels. It’s not the place for kids to run around and cause chaos like kids do. I’d be staying somewhere else for sure if travelling with young kids.

* I don’t understand people staying here for more than 3 nights – I’d get bored out of my skull!

Overall, although I have focused on the negative, we had a great stay. However, in my opinion, the hotel is not worth the premium rates being charged (~A$1,100 per night). We went to Four Seasons Sayan (Ubud) after this property. Around the same price, I felt it was a better and more luxurious experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
845,Bliss,50,July 2016,"My daughter and myself and a friend and her daughter stayed here, it was absolutely perfect, we had a two bedroom suite, it was spacious and the views.
The staff are wonderful they could not do enough for you just to make you more comfortable, we will definitely stay here again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
846,"Beautiful location, friendly staff but falling a little short of 5 stars",40,July 2016,"Really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to everyone. The staff was truly friendly and helpful. I booked 7 nights and got a really nice upgrade because of my length of stay which was a nice surprise upon check in.
There were a few opportunities. 1. The rooms are starting to show some age. I had to get lights replaced, toilet repaired (twice) and safe replaced. 2. The staff are not as efficient on slow days as they are on busy days. We had to wait 30 minutes for eggs on busy days. 3. I would think for 5 stars they would remember more of your preferences, ex I had to call twice a day, everyday for ice. 4. Try to separate the adults and families. I woke up to kids screaming every day. Literally. 5. Put some alcohol in your cocktails.
Most likely I would recommend this for families but could be nice for couples too.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
847,Nice place to stay,40,June 2016,"After staying three days at the Oberoi we went to the club villa at hotel The Legian , its location is awesome right on beach but slightly on height ,so u can have a view of sea from their infinity pool. Private villa pool and hospitality is at the best. Our private butler named Komang made our three days stay relaxed n update for all in house service. He suggested us to have a Quad biking in rice field which was a super thrill fun n exciting as we all three had a different bikes,",The Legian Seminyak Bali
848,Special place,50,July 2016,"Loved the Legian.
The pool is fabulous with lots of space to enjoy the beauty and relaxed feeling of the surroundings. Loved the little touches from the hotel such as the pool pack you get when you sit on your lounge/ day bed- two cold towels that smell great, a spritzer infused with aromatherapy scent...cold water on demand...friendly and relaxed service.
The rooms are large and spacious, we received an upgrade and were very grateful. The rooms are a bit dark and dated but still lovely to be in and the kitchenette with the inclusive supply of snacks and drinks was enjoyed. The coffee at the hotel is excellent as is the breakfast. We used the gym daily, which was excellent and enjoyed the wellness centre too after a work out. Yoga was OK- it's always beneficial to do and always challenging in the heat after leaving 8 degrees back home! It was different to my regular class which was refreshing and fun. The teacher was kind and assisted all the students.
Dinner at the restaurant was nice, it was lovely to relax by the pool and not run around Seminyak with the hustle and bustle for one night :) The food was reasonable- some dishes were better than others (apparently my partners was awesome, mine not so much). Overall this hotel is situated in a great location and if you want to avoid the noise and doof doof this is a great option with gorgeous staff and a beautiful environment to enjoy it in. Thanks to all the staff at the Legian:)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
849,Still the best hotel in Bali ...,50,July 2016,"The ambience, design and location of this property are far superior to others, with it's sprawling lawns, ocean views and majestic suites, but it's the staff that really make an impact! We've been repeat guests now for over 8 years and it just keeps getting better ... each time I leave I ask myself how?
The new GM is a wonderful man, very well suited it seems to this property! The concierge staff are fantastic, as are the bell boys and restaurant staff, breakfast is a daily delight and dinners with Chef Luke are an absolute indulgence! Housekeeping and room service staff are always extremely courteous and mindful of privacy along with doing a great job. Make sure when you're by the pool at one of the beach restaurants you have a chat to Bagus - quite an amazing young fellow, a fantastic member of the Legian team! I could keep on mentioning names but the list is never-ending ... all are simply the best!
Good wishes always to all the staff at our favourite home away from home in Bali - looking forward to our next stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
850,overpriced and overrated..,20,July 2016,"room was nice, but the rest of the hotel is quite boring.. the design of the lobby, hallways, swimming pool, restaurant and food quality are all very ordinary, not like what i would expect from a 5 star resort.

the only thing that was good about the hotel is that i think most if not all the rooms are facing the ocean. ours was kind of blocked by the coconut trees. but if you get a corner room on the top floor you will get a sweeping view of the ocean.

i stayed at the alila next door a few months ago... Alila's room was cheaper, breakfast was better, more selections.. they have smoothies, etc.. Alila's design was much better too, the swimming pool, the restaurant by the pool.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
851,The Legian,50,June 2016,"We stayed at the Legian for three absolutely fantastic weeks. From the moment we arrived till the day we left, we were treated like royalty. Forgot all our troubles and were inveloped in treatments and great food in one of the most picturesque hotels you can get. But nothing compares to the people you meet here. Always going out of their way to accommodate our every whim. Even ensuring items we had purchased were shipped to our home. Absolutely beautiful people, in particular, Agung Bagoes. Going above and beyond, making us feel apart of his family both at The Legian and at his own home. With recommendations to all Bali has to offer. Simply the only place to stay when in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
852,"Great experience, 5 STAR",50,July 2016,"I came her for 5 nights in July for a family trip. The staff were amazing and could speak fluent english. The rooms were clean, and really well decorated. It had a great pool overlooking the ocean. The food at the hotel was simply devine.
The gardens are amzing and are very well looked after. The security is really good with armed guards at all exits keeping the resort safe. The facillities including gym and spa were very clean and modern.

If youre in Bali The Legian is a must stay.
Simply the best in Bali.
10/10.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
853,AMAZING - Pure luxury,50,June 2016,"This hotel exceeded all our expectations. From the very minute we arrived, we were treated like royalty, nothing was ever too much for them. The property itself is luxurious, well kept and the infinity pool is wonderful - the food being particularly lovely and they catered to our every need. The management team hold a reception party every week to ensure they meet every guest staying at the hotel, and all staff knew us by name. I've been fortunate enough to stay in a lot of 5* hotels but this one is truly exceptional. When I return to Bali I wouldn't stay anywhere else!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
854,First time in Bali,50,August 2015,"This was our first visit to Bali and from the moment we landed we were treated like family.
We like to travel and rarely go back to the same place but I think we were already planning a return by day 2.
The Balanese people are lovely and made us extremely welcome.
An important peice of advice though would be to get a guide without a shadow of a doubt.
There's no way we would have found half of the places we went to, whether superb restaurants/eating places to tourist spots.
For this we had Agung Bagous to thank.
Agung not only new where to go but the easiest ways to get there and when you see the ordered chaos that they call traffic you'll be thankful you did believe me!!
I would recommend Seminyak as it's far enough out to be quite relaxed but only a short taxi ride to town.
Can't wait to return!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
855,"Peerless legend, flawless service.",50,May 2016,"Everything people write about this splendid hotel is correct, they do not exaggerate, however the overwhelming factor in all this praise is due to the staff, who are, quite simply, outstanding. Nothing is too much bother, anything that can be done to make your experience better, happens without a moments hesitation, and the pleasure of being acknowledged by your name, is a ridiculous conceit, but does make you feel ""special"" - and that is what a stay at The Legian is, special. Often mentioned as one of the finest hotels in the world, the Management deserve congratulations for the high standard of service their ""team"" gives, and always with a smile. Thank you, again we bathed in the glow of your hospitality, and returned home relaxed and refreshed. Till next time......",The Legian Seminyak Bali
856,Amasing hotel for a tranquil break,40,June 2016,"The Legian Hotel in Bali is conveniently located on the beach in Seminyak within walking distance to the popular Eat Street. The hotel has a Asian, boutique style with only 67 rooms. Entering the lobby the décor provides a sense of relaxation, you can see and hear the ocean, staff are very attentive and the atmosphere perfect for a chilled out beach holiday.
We stayed in a One Bedroom Deluxe Suite, with Indian Ocean views, a amasing bath tub and huge patio. The Suite was a brilliant size, with 2 toilets and a small kitchen, Aqua Di Parma Amenities, complimentary soft drinks and snacks replenished daily as well as a nightly turn down service and special homemade treat from the chef. All these little touches really helped make the holiday extra special.
The pool area was lovely, consisting of 3 pools and the choice of beach or pool sunbeds. Ocean view was wonderful, however the sea was extremely fierce throughout our trip, meaning we couldn't actually swim in the sea.
Drinks/food service is available around the pool all day, your complimentary afternoon tea can also be served to your sunbed from 4pm-6pm.
Food at the hotel was amasing. Breakfast served daily in the main restaurant with pool and sea views, options to either eat from buffet or a la carte, all food was extremely high quality. We also ate at the hotel restaurant on our first night at the hotel, this didn't seem to popular as we were the only ones in the restaurant! I think this however was more to do with hotel price than food quality/options. My boyfriend has steak and I had a lobster and tofu curry, followed by a shared chocolate fondant, both meals were amazing, however I think most guests chose to eat out at one of many restaurants just outside of the hotel.
We also managed to visit the Spa at the Legian, this was superb, we had a couples traditional Balinese massage and then used the steam/sauna/Jacuzzi after- very good service/spa and good quality treatments.
Overall I would defiantly return to this hotel, we left feeling 100% relaxed, I would recommend this hotel mainly to couples wanting to chill out, however there were some families with young children present and some children friendly facilities.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
857,The Service & Location - Superb,50,June 2016,"You really do get what you pay for with The Legian. I traveled here with a bestie of mine in June, 2016 and we were so thrilled with The Club Villa we picked. We had read reviews that it was a little work and dark - all accounts are true but you'd have to be really picky for these few points spoil your holiday. We had Honi, a lovely lady who looked after our every need and made sure that our massages were booked in, our business arrangements taken care of (we were mixing business and pleasure on this trip) from organising our chauffeured car, dinner reservations and of course, our laundry! For two ladies on a getaway, this was a real treat.

The view from the main resort was unreal... so much so that we didn't even venture to our beloved KuDeTa for drinks as it was basically the same but without the music. We were here for a low key, relaxing time so the days we did business, we did. On our free days, we relaxed and took in what the resort and Bali had to offer.

The Club offers a better rate plus many extra benefits which offset the fact that it isnt an oceanfront villa but we never felt like we missed out. We had breakfast in the main resort every day and nothing was missed- you could not get bored with the food on offer here.

And once again, the service! It was really top notch.

Looking forward to staying again soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
858,Wonderful Stay,50,June 2016,The hotel itself maybe a bit old and the shower in the studio suite is too small. But you will find its charm after your stay. The location is perfect. Breakfast is beyond standard. We had a great time.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
859,Nice beach hotel 30 mins from airport,40,June 2016,"A very comfortable luxury beach hotel near the airport.

We only stayed 1 night while en route to Sumba.

We enjoyed the beautiful pool.

Ocean is very rough, so not good for swimming .

The food for dinner at the restaurant is quite gourmet .

But, you can order simpler food fried rice or noodles that are excellent .

Rooms were very nice and comfortable.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
860,A magic and Caring Place,50,June 2016,"Wow what an experience and an excellent hotel. We stayed in the Club villas and all of the staff made us feel very welcome. We have never stayed anywhere that has made us feel so happy and relaxed - Our Butler Yaza and our regular driver Astica exceeded all expectations in the quality of service and care to make sure that we had a great holiday whilst also understanding the culture of the Island.

When our camera broke Yaza arranged an alternative which ensured that all of our treasured memories were recorded for ever. A most appreciated gesture of help.

The food and service in the hotel restaurant was equal to the best in the Michelin starred restaurants in the UK. A difficult art to achieve on regular daily basis across breakfast lunch and dinner.

All of the facilities were kept scrupulously clean and without exception all of the staff were very friendly , help ful and patiently answered all of our questions when we wished to know more about their culture.

A deep felt thank you to Tim and the whole of his team for a truly wonderful experience. We will be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
861,Fantastic!!,50,June 2016,"Everything is fabulous about this resort. The 2 bedroom suite was huge and perfect for our family of four.

Views were unbelievable! Service was the best we ever experienced!

You can't go wrong here. Well done!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
862,"""Out of this world""",50,July 2015,This is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. Me and my wife stayed here on our honeymoon and we were blown away by the level of service we received. The food in the restaurant is excellent with a fantastic menu. The only bad thing is that once you have stayed here you will never want to go anywhere else.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
863,"Still very, very good.",50,June 2016,"Second visit to The Legian in 7 months, this time for 8 nights. The previous stay was flawless, so it was with a degree of trepidation that I returned. Consistency is a difficult thing for a top end hotel to achieve, especially when they have set the bar so high to begin with. The change in management group from GHM to LHM was also a source of concern. Would standards have dropped? But my concerns were unfounded. Service was impeccable as ever, and my wife and I enjoyed every minute of our stay. The property itself is not the grandest on the Seminyak beachfront, and it's certainly not the newest. The rooms are starting to show their age, but they remain very comfortable and tasteful. What really sets The Legian apart is it's staff. They simply cannot be faulted. A more professional, competent, and genuinely friendly group of people you'd be hard pressed to find. They are unfailingly courteous, and their consistent willingness to provide for their guests comfort is exceptional. A few observations: the cocktails at the pool bars need some work. They are not particularly well mixed. A hotel of The Legian's caliber should be renowned for the best cocktails on the beachfront. I was also a little disappointed with the food at the restaurant this time around. We had dinner twice, and on both occasions, I felt underwhelmed. The presentation was wonderful, and the service was, as usual, impeccable. But the flavour was missing. It's not that it wasn't tasty. It was. It was just unexceptional. But all in all, it was another terrific stay at The Legian, and I would recommend this hotel to discerning travelers with no hesitation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
864,Our Favorite Bali Hotel!,50,June 2016,"We just arrived back home from an amazing two week honeymoon in Bali. We stayed in three different high end resorts and both agreed that the Legian was definitely our favorite. We booked a villa at the club and it is definitely recommended. Directly across the street from the main hotel (they will buggy you across the street but it is easily walkable) you get all the amenities of the main hotel but with the quiet and privacy. Villas are large and well equipped with their own private pool. Best part is that each villa has a butler who is on staff just to take care of you. We lucked out and had Bona who easily made our stay most memorable. Bona booked restaurants, helped plan excursions, and made sure that any wish was granted. Bona, along with the entire team were so helpful and really aimed to please. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel every morning to take in the amazing beach views. Others have mentioned they remember you and what you like- our experience was no different. Our beverage orders arrived at the table every morning without having to ask. We had room service, snacks by the pool and dinner in the club bar and everything was perfect. While I am sure every room is wonderful, if you get a chance to stay in the villas you will really enjoy the experience. Afternoon tea, cocktails, mini bar, laundry, car service is all included. We enjoyed the spa treatments which were not only wonderful but affordable for a luxury hotel where you can literally hear the waves crashing as you receive your treatment. It's the little things that really make a property stand out as a real winner- the personal touches we experienced while at the Legian helped start our trip off right. We are already dreaming about returning and just got back! On a side note- we ventured out to some other popular neighboring Seminyak hotels (W, Double Six, etc) and felt strongly that the smaller and better located Legian was the absolute best for us.

Special thank you to Bona (ask for him if you stay at the villas- you wont regret it!) We had a trip to remember thanks to the wonderful staff and will be recommending the Legian to all friends and family.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
865,THE AMAZING LEGIAN,50,June 2016,"A magical, restful, pampering awesome holiday where EVERYTHING was perfect in every respect. Our 2 bedroom suite located on 3rd floor was simply gorgeous. 2 big bedrooms (both on suite), with most comfortable beds, big cupboards, divine showers and bath, little kitchenette and an awesome patio with the most spectacular view of the pool and ocean. The detail and love are in the fresh flowers, daily change of fruit, all the delicious goodies left in the kitchen for you every day, different array of chocolates, cookies etc every night at turn down and the most delicious coffee. The pool area is awesome. You are treated like a king where everything is laid on for you. Beds organized with towells, ice water, sprays for face, sorbets and delicious little sample juices.. (Free) We can't say enough about the divine friendly staff all of whom know you by name. Even the vendors on the beach like to know your name. Such special gentle beautiful people.
Breakfasts are a treat deluxe.....OMG!!!
Out of five massages two were good, so possibly a bit of training is needed there. The dinners are exceptional as were the lunches eaten at the pool. Last but not least, the daily yoga classes held by Putra the yoga teacher, were EXCEPTIONAL. He is so special and the most WONDERFUL teacher.
You are near to all shops and great restaurants.
As seen by the length of this review, I can't find enough GOOD to say about The Legian and ALL their wonderful staff.
PS Couldnt leave the magnificent Koi fish out...... Awesome.
TEN STARS",The Legian Seminyak Bali
866,Thought put into every detail,50,May 2016,"The property is stunning, but the service is what really sets this hotel apart. We have travelled to luxury properties all over the world and were still blown away. We stayed for a portion of our honeymoon and did not want to leave. From the incense left outside of our door, to remembering our coffee orders in the morning, to local musicians playing daily, no detail was left out. Everyone was so kind and genuine. We are so happy we chose to spend our honeymoon at the Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
867,Pretty amazing and amazingly pretty,50,June 2016,"We had had a week at a villa (Paadi Villa from Goodwill Getaways) which was so lovely the family group didn't want to leave.... But then we arrived at the Legian... And we managed to get over the grief pretty quickly.

This hotel has the most beautiful rooms, imaculate grounds and wonderful staff. We dined at some pretty high-rated restaurants over the 10 days but all felt the restaurant here was better than the rest so didn't bother leaving after a while.

We arrived a bit early but were put up in the 'hospitality suite' which gave us free run of a room while we waited and we were able to change and head to the pool while we waited.

The staff were both friendly and professional and nothing was too much trouble. They dealt with the kids well and accommodated a big group discreetly and sensitively.

The bathrooms and supplies are all high quality, it's very clean and the rooms are huge... We did get a suite so there are presumably smaller ones. But the huge balcony was great for everyone to meet up, the free selection of drinks and snacks is really helpful.

The best but though really is the pool area... It is beautiful. Heaps of daybeds and lounges either over the pool or beach. Food and drinks come to you...Three levels of infinity pool means you don't feel too crowded. We pretty much hung out there dawn to dusk.

Well located in Seminyak, there's a short cut to Seminyak Square (which incidentally has a bottle shop in it so you can get wine for your pre-dinner drinks at a marginally less extortionate price than the hotel ... but still heart-breaking to pay 100 bucks for a $40 wine max!)

Anyway, Indonesian wine prices aside I would happily live at the Legian forever!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
868,Superb Grand Hotel in Bali,50,November 2015,"I really loved the stay in this gem of Bali.
Nive rooms which are cozy and cool interior from jaya ibrahim.
In my opinion i like the decent vintage touch of the interior.

Fantastic pool area and friendly staff.

Thanks a lot for the faboulous stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
869,More than a special hotel,50,June 2016,"The Legian Bali offers all the grandness, sophistication, style and superior service of a world class hotel. A very special way for our group to finish a fantastic 2 week trip to Bali. I could highlight all the various attributes the hotel offers to make a visit to The Legian Bali memorable, however these points have been largely covered in many other reviews- if you are wanting a luxurious Bali experience, the Legian is definitely the place to choose.
In this review I will focus on another aspect that may not be uppermost in mind when planning a holiday- that is, what happens if I get seriously ill? This was my experience and I was so grateful to be staying at The Legian Bali and for how the staff assisted me. High quality medical assistance was promtly organised, care and concern were expressed by staff and I was made to feel as comfortable as possible.
Health is paramount and cannot be compromised, a fact that sometimes is only understood when ill. When selecting accomodation, it is certainly an important point to consider. Personally, I am very thankful I was at The Legian Bali. Thank you to all staff and the medical team you organised.
Our group has already reserved dates for next year's trip and I look forward to being back at The Legian Bali, in full health, on those day beds overlooking the glorious ocean! A delightful holiday destination we look forward to returning to.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
870,Perfect honeymoon,50,June 2016,"Today is the second day of our honeymoon at The Legian and me and my wife could not have hoped for a better place. I read all the reviews before coming here and they turned out to be so true! First of all the staff is so genuine and nice. Secondly, the hotel is a feast for all your senses. In the mornings the waves and the sound of water in the pools make an amazing start for the day. The hotel surroundings smell so nice as well and at night they burn incents at our villa so when you come home it truly makes a difference. The breakfast is very attentive and tasty. My wife is lactose and gluten intolerant and they made a note of it prior to our arrival so in our breakfast we had soy milk and coconut sorbet instead of yogurt. A huge plus for couples who want to eat healthy!

We tried the spa during our first day and it was wonderful. Everything was handled professionally and the prices are reasonable compared to spas in big cities.

Hotel grounds are marvelous although we are staying at the club side where the villas are, we will visit the grounds for sunset drinks.

For those couples that are trying to decide between the villas or the hotel, if you can afford it definitely go for the private villa. It is another level of service and the privacy is unmatched. You feel in a different world since it is so secluded, which is hard in the heart of seminyak. As you can see in the pictures the villa is just perfect for a couple, big and spacious! But what you wont realize before you come here is the extra services that come inclusive when you book a villa. First, you get a private butler. Even if you are used to doing everything yourself, this is sooo great! Your butler will book restaurants for you, give you local recommendations,tidy up your villa when you are not there, bring you whatever food or drinks you need, stock up your fridge with drinks (oh yeah you get free top shelf liquor with the villa as well:), have your laundry done on a daily basis and anything else that you can think of. Also, you get your own private black car service with the villa which is just amazing for daily trips or when you go out to restaurants so you dont have to worry about taxis.

We also got complementary champagne when we arrived and a honeymoon cake!

Just book the legian if it fits your budget and dont worry about a single thing during your honeymoon!

Burak",The Legian Seminyak Bali
871,6 stars,50,June 2016,"Close to perfect, this ranks in the top 3 hotel experiences I've ever had and I can't remember the other two. We stayed in a private villa with its own pool and the whole experience was superb.

The service made the experience and our butler Honi, made sure that every whim was attended to. The water pump in the pool was too noisy. That was fixed in 5 minutes. New towels? They arrived instantly. Not enough nuts in the mini bar? Topped up straight away.

The location of the club and the villas mean total privacy with peace and quiet. Even if you go to the club pool (for the villa guests only) you will be lucky to see another guest.

If you wanted to mingle with other guests the hotel pools were available but also not that busy.

We used the spa, the hotel restaurant for breakfast and dinner and the ocean front bar for cocktails. The only negative thing I can say is that the hotel dinner menu felt quite limited compared to the other restaurant options outside the hotel. Otherwise the staff can't do enough to help you.

The deal we had included airport transfers with a host to escort you to and from the terminal to the car, drinks from the mini bar, lots of laundry, afternoon tea, drinks during cocktail hour - 6pm- 8pm and use of the hotel car within seminyak.

6 stars.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
872,PARADISE,50,June 2016,"This hotel and it's setting is paradise. A small 'boutique' hotel but with everything you could possibly need. The setting on the beach is perfect. The rooms and all amenities are immaculate; the service was second to none, the view was breathtaking, especially at sunset.... and all facilities were fantastic. The staff could not be more friendly or helpful. An absolute haven of peace and tranquility in otherwise busy Seminyak.
One of THE best hotels we have ever stayed in.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
873,"Amazing service, but not ideally located and a bit too formal",40,May 2016,"We went to the Legian for our first few nights in a month long trip. The suite was beautiful and tastefully decorated, with fresh fruits and a treat everyday. They thought about every details, and we appreciated for example the collection of Blu-rays available from the concierge.

The service is top notch. However, the staff doesn't know how to adapt to what makes the guests feel comfortable and, compared to other luxury hotels, behave a bit too much like servants.
The buildings themselves are very resort-like and have no charm, but the gardens are beautiful, and the view is amazing, especially at sunset. The location of the hotel, on a road with luxury hotels only (no shops, no restaurants), means that you will be stuck there. It is fine if you like the resort experience, staying all day in the hotel, eating at the Legian restaurant, going on trips only with a driver, etc.
The restaurant is amazing, and we had there some of the best food we ever had.
The pool area is beautiful as well and it is a pleasure to watch the sea from it. We really appreciated the deep pool designed for laps and not for leisure only.
We had the Seafood Indulgence at the pool bar, which is a 'buffet/BBQ' seafood-based dinner held every Friday night at the pool bar. While the food was amazing, we were a bit disappointed that, although it was supposed to be a buffet, we were almost harrassed by the waiters (more waiters than guests) who were putting back our towel on our lap every time we moved, asking us how was the food, coming with us to the buffet area, following us everywhere, etc. Because of this bad experience on the first night, we ordered room service only for the remainder of the stay to have a bit of peace, and would recommend having room service or eating at the restaurant, and to savoid the Seafood Indulgence at the pool bar.
The breakfast held at the restaurant is varied and delicious. There is a hot food menu with waffles, eggs benedicts and the like, local breakfast food such as fried rice, a cellar with cheeses and cold cuts, a big choice of yoghurt and fresh fruits, pastries, etc.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
874,Deserves 7 stars,50,May 2016,"I am not sure where to start with this hotel as from they were faultless from our airport pick up (complete with ice water and cold towels to refresh you) to our airport drop off and they thought of every detail throughout our stay.

Firstly, the views are stunning and we had a one bed deluxe suite. The room was huge with a separate pantry, bedroom, living room, study and dining room area. The pantry was stocked with complimentary snacks, fresh coffee, tea, water and a range of soft drinks and fruit juices.

The bedroom is huge, there is a beach bag provided to use during your stay and an iPod which links to the iPod and Bose system that is provided in the living room. Bathroom amenities are fabulous – all Aqua di Parma and there are candles provided should you want to have a bath by candlelight. The bed is endless and very comfortable,

We also had a large balcony with a table and a day bed. Again in the evening they provide candles for the balcony should you want to watch sunset or have a drink. Wi-Fi is excellent throughout the hotel and even works by the pool.

Breakfast has a wide variety of Western and Asian dishes all carefully prepared and delicious. They even have a separate cheese room! There is complimentary afternoon tea which you can have in your room or by the pool/beach. We had dinner in the restaurant – a wonderful experience both for the quality and uniqueness of the food and the ambience of the restaurant in the evening by the ocean.

Their three tier infinity pool is heavenly and they keep you well supplied with cold towels, ice water and face mist to cool down when it gets to warm,.

All the staff greeted us by name – no idea how they manage this. Service is exceptional from every single member of staff irrespective of role. They even have a gentlemen outside the hotel who will stop traffic to help you cross the road. For our anniversary, they gave me a bouquet of flowers and champagne at breakfast. Then at night a bottle of champagne and a delicious chocolate cake.

We have never stayed anywhere quite like this and we stay in a lot of top end hotels. The Legian made our stay in Bali and there are simply not enough superlatives to describe the attention to detail, the quality of the staff and the hotel itself. The GM here should be exceptionally proud of his team.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
875,This place is Paradise Found!,50,June 2016,The Legian in Seminyak area in Bali is really one of THE most magical places to stay! The suites are all luxurious and beautifully decorated as well as comfy and relaxing. The Pool and beach as well as the ambiance and surroundings are to die for. The Spa must be experienced to know how exquisite it is and the restaurant headed by Chef Luke is really something to write home about!I had nothing but the best time there! Thank you to everyone at The Legian for making my stay in Bali so memorable!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
876,Highly recommended!,50,June 2016,"From an elegant checkin and complementary airport transportation ( after a little negotiating), we were treated like royalty despite our 2am arrival. We stayed three nights and had a very very late checkout, they helped us come up with a compromise to avoid any breaks in our stay. The staff went out of their way to be exceptionally helpful, polite and made the experience wonderful.
They do twice daily room service, but it seemed like every time we left the room it was back in sparkling condition when we returned. Giant bed, large tub big enough for two. Our suite had two balconies and was on the ground level. All the rooms are full ocean view.
We had complimentary breakfast included and the daily variety was amazing, from local cuisine to western food to fresh croissants and local made jams.
They have motorbikes you can rent, albeit at a higher price than the hawkers renting them on the street, but we used the hotels as they were new,in great condition and had a great time on them.
Easy walking distance to Seminyak square area with food and nightlife.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
877,"Beyond 5*, Best hotel we've ever stayed in, absolute paradise",50,July 2015,"We travelled to Bali in June 2015 for a week, as the last stop on our honeymoon. The Legian hotel, is without a doubt, the most amazing hotel, we have ever stayed in. Everything was stunning; the hotel itself, the staff service, the food, the afternoon tea, the cocktails, the pools, everything was beyond 5*. AS it was our honeymoon, they kindly gave us a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite and we arrived to champagne and a chocolate cake! Honestly the pictures don’t do it justice. Loved every second here, was the best was to end the trip of a lifetime.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
878,"Warm, Friendly and Classy",50,June 2016,"The Legian represents everything you want a beach holiday to be. From the point my family & I were collected from the airport right to the point we were dropped back off. We went at the end of May to beginning June for 5 days. As we were with our 2 teenage girls, we got a 2 bedroom suite. On the highest level, of a 4-storey building, we got commanding views of the South China Sea. Breakfast (7 to 11am) came with our room as did tea (4-6pm). A good selection of continental, western & local breakfast choices with a dedicated chilled cheese/wine room. Hot breakfast can be ordered, including pancakes (the macadamia pancakes are delicious), waffles, eggs, french toast, fried rice & noodles. In-room, we got complimentary soft drinks & snacks. Tea was usually 3 types of sweets with a choice of regular tea or coffee served in-room or wherever you may be in the hotel. Shopping within walking distance as are the restaurants. The hotel is always happy to assist with bookings. 90-minute yoga also came complimentary with mat & towel provided. Held on the grounds facing the ocean except when it rains and it is held at the yoga studio.

The service in Bali is generally good, but at The Legian, the attention to detail is amazing. We were addressed by name by all staff. On the first day of breakfast I requested for olive oil & honey. And those were ready for me on subsequent days. They also remembered my tea preference. Many of the staff are long serving so they remember you on your next visit.

Toiletries were standard with Aqua Di Parma products. Do bring your own toothbrush/paste, shaving kit & hair brush.

The Legian is family friendly but do not expect to find on-site activities. It's very much a chill-with-a-book -by-the-pool kind of hotel. There is a library at the lobby. Also a good spa & gym. The sound system in-room is fantastic as they use Bose. Ipods were on loan. The TV reception wasn't great but wifi was available free throughout the resort including in the hotel transport. Signals were very good.

Security was tight but friendly. At the time we were there, the beach was open but swimming was not always allowed due to the strong currents. But there are 3 pools of varying depths and sizes to choose from, all facing the sea.

I would go back to Bali, if for nothing else, simply to stay and chill at The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
879,Personalized service that really made our vacation special,50,May 2016,"We rented a villa in the Club Legian property for four nights, and we had a wonderful experience. We stayed during low season, so we pretty much had the long pool and restaurant and bar in the Club to ourselves, which was very relaxing. Our villa was huge with a lovely side yard and private plunge pool. The villa had nice touches - like an iPod fully loaded with music, free laundry every day, fresh fruit, and our local newspaper printed out in full every morning. Arisna, our butler, took care of our every request, and materialized out of nowhere a few times like a ninja just when we needed him. He set up lunch and dinner reservations at amazing places within walking distance of the hotel. Tim, the Club GM, was available and friendly, and we felt very welcome. We had free breakfast across the street on the ocean every morning and they took great care of us. We would visit again any time! Thanks to the Legian for such a nice vacation experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
880,Gorgeous hotel and a truly fantastic setting,50,May 2016,"There is nothing that can be improved upon. We checked in at 1am, welcomed with a drink and cold towel even at this unearthly hour. We were given a brief tour of the hotel and facilities, before being shown to our room. Every last detail has been thought about and it really shows.
The breakfast is beautiful catering for all nationalities, with English, continental and local Asian breakfast in full buffet spread.
The location, views and pools have to be seen to be believed. We have stayed in Bali before and this hotel really does offer luxury on the beach front.
Lastly, the service by the staff was second to none. A high level of service can be expected for the price, however this was above and beyond that of other 5* hotels that are available.

The road in and out of Seminyak can be extremely busy (the high street), but if you can ask your driver to avoid the main high street, and considerable time can be saved sat in the car in traffic jams. There are a number of back roads.

We will revisit again when we are next in Bali - Thank you.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
881,Service and luxury doesn't get much better than this - simply the best,50,May 2016,"We have been to a lot of hotels / resorts over the years, some really great hotels, but for setting, design, rooms, comfort and, most importantly, service the Legian Bali is simply the best!

We were here for just over two weeks at the end of a long tour of SE Asia - so we were looking to spoil ourselves a bit and enjoy the experience. We had arranged an airport pick up through the hotel and from the time we were met at the airport to the time we were left back (to the baggage check-in at the airport) on our way home, every member of staff was warm, friendly and very genuine in their interactions with us and the other guests. Everyone seems to know your name no matter who you interacted with - really impressive. I have never seen such a high level of guest service.

The room was spacious, comfortable with every convenience and amenity you might wish for, and stunning views out over the garden to the crashing waves on the beach.

Excellent breakfast could be served poolside or inside, but it was hard not to opt for outdoors given the setting. There is a separate pool side restaurant for lunch and / or cocktails, or you can have very tasty snacks where ever you wish. On Sunday evenings there is a great cool jazz session to bring you through the spectacular sunset. The food at 'the Restaurant' is top notch with an extensive wine list.

The staff were very helpful in both recommending and arranging bookings in outside restaurants which is a good sign of a hotel confident in its own service offerings.

The hotel can be a bit quiet in the evenings though the end of May is probably the off season. However, the hotel is very close to both the shopping area and the various restaurants and bars around Seminyak.

It is a very romantic hotel, particularly in the evenings when they light up the braziers along the infinity pool and the candles in the outside walkways throughout the hotel.

Our stay at the Legian Bali was a fitting end to our tour of SE Asia and well exceeded our expectations. I would thoroughly recommend the hotel for both couples and families, and indeed there were some guests there having a solo break. It was simply the best and we would happily return there again. Many thanks to all the staff.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
882,Excellent all over,50,May 2016,"This place is awesome! They treat you like a king everywhere, rooms are really roomy and has everythig, everyday something special and i stayed in studio. Have been many places in Bali and this hotel has the best view, pools, beach and food all great. Definitely wanna stay here not even want to try another place in Bali again next time",The Legian Seminyak Bali
883,Wonderfull❤️❤️❤️,50,May 2016,"Me and my boyfriend stayed 7 nights, we loved this place, service is perfect, view from hotel room and from the beach priceless. Staff is really nice, profesional, also smiling all the time. I dont have one thing to complain about. I am with all my heart recommanding this place to everyone. Will come back again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
884,Excellent hotel,50,May 2016,"We stayed here for a week at the end of our honeymoon stay in Bali. The hotel is in a great location in Seminyak. Close to loads of shopping, bars and eateries.

We stayed in a beautiful suite, with lots of space - own kitchen area (including complimentary snacks, soft drinks and afternoon tea) and balcony area.

Breakfast was delicious - lots of choice to cater for all tastes.

Staff knew our names and were very friendly.

For us, it was the poolside service in particular which made our stay. The staff were simply fantastic - very attentive and helpful, including moving our parasol regularly to keep me in the shade and keeping guests regularly refreshed with fresh water.

As well as three pools on site, we were right on the beach. Security onsite was also very good / keeping sellers from the beach at bay

Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
885,If I could award more stars I would not hesitate in doing so.,50,May 2016,"I visited the Legian with my wife and my son and his wife and we occupied a 2 bedroom suite.
The standard of the room and the service that accompanied it is too difficult to described
All 4 of us said 'how can you put into words the the experience of staying at this hotel'.
We still cannot do this hotel justice in so many words
I(we) will simply say 'the hotel and its staff were outstanding'
We will retrurn",The Legian Seminyak Bali
886,Amazing,50,November 2015,Truly great service. Attended to every need and want. Rooms Beautiful. Grounds beautiful. Amazing pool area. Pool staff would place towels -- refills towels every time you get up. Truly great service. Nice hotel location. Walked out to bars/restaurants. Or took a super cheap tax ride. Shopping lots and lots within walking distance. Once you get to the hotel- nightlife is super accessible without a car...,The Legian Seminyak Bali
887,Great Resort,40,September 2015,"We stayed in this resort for almost a week time in the Villa. The buffet breakfast is pretty decent, but getting a bit bored in the last few days. Juni served us in the villa, she is very helpful, always know which drinks we like whenever we come back to our room she ask the staff to get the drinks ready, and she will get the laundry daily, etc. The pool in the villa is big enough for me to do swimming early in the morning. The car service to other local areas in Semiyak is helpful as well, if you ask for a child seat, they will prepare this for you. However, the rooms are pretty worned out, the water of the air con was dripping on our luggages, which was a night mare. The room was designed too dark for my child to watch iPad in the evening. The outdoor bath was not very clean, has spider in it, and seems like no one cleaned it for awhile. Too bad their service is top notch but they need to upgrade their facilities abit otherwise this resort is in good location, service is top notch, and the food is pretty ok. There is not view in the villa rooms, but that doesn't bother me. The management tried to please us by sending us a free spa session.The spa is pretty good as well. A relaxing place to be all in all.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
888,The best place in Bali by far,50,May 2016,"If you're feeling a bit deflated, then this place will surely lift your spirits. Luxurious without being overstated, it has an intimate family feel about it and it isn't too big that you can get ""lost"".
The service was the best I have experienced anywhere in the world and how every single staff member knows and remembers your name,I'll never know, but it is all part of the amazing experience at The Legian.
The stunning pools were right on the beach front and were ready and sparkling every morning, whilst the restaurants were also top class.
Everything is within walking distance and you will not find better anywhere in Bali, and I've stayed at most of them. .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
889,Pure Luxury!,50,May 2016,"I have visited Bali many times before and stayed in Villas. I stayed at The Legian for my honeymoon and my wife and I absolutely loved it. Service, Staff, Location and Hotel Amenities were all 10/10. Highly recommend for couples and families wanting a luxury resort feel whilst staying in the heart of Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
890,Outstanding hotel with top class service,50,May 2016,"We chose the Legian in Seminyak for our 25th Wedding Anniversary and were not disappointed. We have done a lot of travel and this stands out as one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The view over the ocean and the grounds was stunning. Above all the warm friendly staff and attention to detail was amazing. We stayed in a studio suit and it was massive and very beautifully appointed. The complimentary champagne, cake and flowers on the day of our anniversary was very thoughtful. We can not to visit again next year.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
891,"If heaven is a place on earth, then this must be it",50,April 2016,"What can I say? This place is simply HEAVEN. From the meet and greet at the airport to the last goodbye at the airport - everything was excellent.
Meet at the airport, driver of the transfer, front desk check in, bell captains, restaurant service staff, pool staff, staff at the spa - all excellent.
Seriously speaking - if heaven is a place on earth, The Legian must be it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
892,Lovely Hotel unfortunately we had rowdy neighbours,30,February 2016,"This was not our first stay with The Legian and as always we were made to feel very welcome. The hotel is perfect and the service great. We enjoy The Legian because we like the peaceful nature of the hotel. We have always enjoyed our stay there. Unfortunately during our recent stay there was a group of 4 Russians also staying at the hotel. They were noticeable by the pool, that is, loud and lots of drinking basically typical Russians. What was worse was they were staying next door to us and yes they partied and drank until 5am in the morning. I did not call staff because I know how rude and obnoxious these guys can be especially when drunk. I was up all night. Of course the staff were accommodating and agreed to move us. Unfortunately it was not a great start to our stay and the sleepless night turned into a migraine and the rest of our stay was mostly spent in bed. I was not happy. This was not expected at this level of accommodation. Everybody deserves to have a good time but not at the expense of others.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
893,This hotel is perfect,50,May 2016,"We have travelled the world and stayed at hundreds of hotels and its fair to say that this probably the best overall experience of staying at a hotel anywhere! Having not been to Bali for 15 years (we were living in Jakarta at the time ) we are amazed by the development of Seminyak but the Legian is an Oasis of peace, quiet and luxury .We chose it because we like smaller hotels and it has a really personal feel , you are always personally addressed by name wherever you are !The staff are the best we have ever experienced for helpfulness , kindness and friendliness and this is consistent from arrival to leaving. On arrival we experienced probably the best welcome ever at a hotel both in terms of friendliness but also from a practical point of view. Our room was spacious and elegant with lovely sea views through the palms. The sitting areas round the pool and beach are lovely and the staff are incredibly good at helping you keep out of the sun , moving sunshades , bringing spray mists , cold towels and cold Bintang beers on demand, then later on tea and cakes in the afternoon ! The 3 level infiniti pool which draws your sight line straight directly down the levels into the crashing ocean is a piece of engineering art and a real pleasure to swim in ! We had the Friday seafood buffet on the terrace by the ocean and by candlelight , this was expensive but a lovely evening in an amazing setting.
You can walk directly out into Seminyak and eat at a choice of many restaurants ( including the long established beachfront ""La Lucciola"" ) and see some really nice shops amongst the usual market stalls so the location is perfect. Our rate also included a lovely Balinese massage at the spa ..dont miss
that. When we left the hotel driver took us back to the airport where a uniformed Legian staff member met us at the kerbside and took our luggage right into the airport, which is just an example the sort of attention to detail that you rarely see anywhere else these days. We will be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
894,Superb!!!!,50,May 2016,"Recently we've stayed throughout Asia in Peninsula's, Four Seasons, Banyan Tree and The Club at The Legian, Bali has topped them all!

The staff were all excellent, Merta our butler and Honi get a special mention however all the staff from the restaurant staff, the drivers, the baby sitters at Kids Club, to the men at the front of house (who gave our children food to feed the fish daily) and those who helped us across the road (even rescuing kites and paintings from kids club, mid crossing) - were all superb!!!!

We travelled with our twins, who have just turned three and we can all be a handful but nothing was too much trouble.

Merta was wonderful, bringing us unlimited refreshments and feeding our cookie monsters. Dealing with our last minute requests with a cool calm, booking us beautiful dining experiences, booking Era our babysitter - even helping us inflate and deflate our children's inflatables for our pool villa.

The drivers took us to Ubud to monkey forest, to see turtles and to the water park - all in air conditioned large vehicles with safe kids seats, wifi, unlimited cool water and they even put our Peppa Pig DVDs. They made what could be challenging moments for us, comfortable.

We have all had an amazing holiday and we will be returning very soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
895,Perfect relaxation,50,May 2016,"Amazing spot,right in front of the beach!
Great staff,so polite and helpful!
Everything was just excellent!
We really appreciated the service and all the complimentary little surprises such as fresh clean towels for the face,green tea water mist etc...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
896,Amazing hotel - surpassed our already high expectations.,50,May 2016,"We actually spent the first 3 days at the W hotel, being a loyal starwoods member, then moved over to the Legian. We thought the W was good, but the Legian was a whole class above. The hotel is mid-sized, and feels more cozy than some of the larger hotels (eg Conrad). The interior courtyards filled with fountains and stone towers are impressive, the rooms are spacious and well appointed in every way. The food is great and the split level infinity pool overlooking the beach is unique. Spa, gym and other facilities also top notch. Then there is the service - waitresses remember your name every time, every staff member greets you with a smile when you are passing in the corridor, and they are accommodation. Gave us a late checkout, no questions asked.

Of course the location is great - slap bang in the middle of Seminyak.

We will be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
897,Loved The Legian,50,April 2016,"We had spent 8 nights in Ubud at The Four Seasons Resort which was amazing and we didn't want to leave, but as soon as we arrived at The Legian and walked through those doors with the beautiful view of the ocean we knew we were going to be fine and it was more than fine! We were shown to our suite on the second floor with that lovely view - the room was a great size and the bathroom is huge with a great power shower and a large bath and his and hers sink areas. We went down to the beautiful pool area and sat on the comfy day beds and ordered cocktails to watch the sunset. We only dined at the hotel once because we wanted to try other restaurant recommendations but the dinner was excellent, as was the selection at breakfast - there was so much choice to suit every taste. Everyday we were served afternoon tea and everyday was totally different little savouries and cakes - it was a nice treat towards the end of the day. The food at the pool bar was also great - tempura prawns and satay and spring rolls etc and on our last day we had a fantastic pizza. Everyone greeted us by our names from day one which is pretty impressive. We had some great spa treatments - I had what was described as the creme de la creme of facials and it was amazing. I did yoga on the grass in front of the ocean which was very special - I'm only a beginner but the instructor was very helpful. We went down to the beach which was a a couple of steps down from the pool area to experience the crashing waves and watch the surfers and take a walk to see things from a different perspective

We settled into this hotel very quickly - it's traditional and classy and the staff are superb I would highly recommend it and we will hopefully return one day.

During our stay we asked to see the Club villas which are literally across the road from the hotel. The accommodation is fabulous - very private with your own pool as well as another pool you can use and they serve breakfast in a nice seated area so you don't have to go far. You are also able to use everything at the hotel as well of course. We were happy with our ocean view room as we had stayed at a pool villa in Ubud so it was a nice contrast for us but it is definitely a great alternative.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
898,Simply amazing.,50,April 2016,"We spent 5 amazing nights at the club at The Legian. Everything and every single staff member, especially Diki, Suma and Suta, made our honeymoon unforgettable. Well worth the 20 hour flight time to have that experience!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
899,Beautiful property,50,April 2016,"Anyone who can rate this property with anything less then 5 stars must be comparing it to something that is several thousand dollars per night, or they are simple unhappy with themselves and they are taking it out on this review. This resort and the restirant with Chef Luke is amazing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
900,Brilliant in every respect,50,April 2016,"A brilliant experience. The Legian Bali is in a perfect location. Couple this with its classy accommodation options, facilities and restaurants as well as the staffs attention to detail, makes this the perfect stay",The Legian Seminyak Bali
901,BEST EVER,50,April 2016,"Best hotel and location. Super friendly staff, always helpful, kind and supportive.
It is wonderful for all age groups, teenagers also...just fantastic. Beach and pool from all rooms
easy to reach. Gym well equipped. Breakfast a wide range of choice. Newly is the stone oven Pizza,
absolutely a plus for old & young. The food in the restaurant is on a very high standard.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
902,"Great location, beautiful room, attentive service",40,April 2016,"Beautiful hotel close to town with an amazing pool. We had a studio suite and would recommend requesting one on the top floor to have a better view of the beach and water. Room size was extremely spacious (plenty of room for 2) with a kitchen as you walk in (loved the complimentary snacks and drinks), another long room for bedroom and living room, and 2 outside patios. Bathroom was also a good size separated by sliding doors behind the bedroom. We had considered getting a pool villa but after reading reviews that these had no view and was not close to the main hotel, we opted for a studio suite and was very happy with our choice. The hotel infinity pool was fantastic with direct view of the Indian Ocean and access to the beach. While the hotel has been around for years, it felt completely brand new and offered updated tech such as 2 complimentary iPods (1 for music in the room and 1 to take to the pool) and speakers that played throughout the room. One thing to be careful of in Seminyak is the tap water is not good. Brush your teeth with the bottled waters provided. While the overall service was great (housekeeping, restaurant) the only reason why our experience was not perfect was because we were not notified in advance that they were hosting an event. We were enjoying the hotel so much that we decided to cancel all of our evening plans and just stay in. As we were in our hotel room late afternoon, we started to hear music blasting and people speaking into microphones. Around 7pm we received a note slipped under our door informing us of an event in their pavilion until 12am, which was pretty much where our room was overlooking. Instead of a romantic quiet night in, we were subjected to blasting music, karaoke, announcements over the microphone, fireworks, and loud screaming and cheering for the next few hours. Needless to say we were extremely annoyed that our quiet romantic evening was ruined and that we had canceled our original plans. Otherwise I would recommend this hotel if you want a luxury place to stay close to the beach and close to town. Complimentary hotel breakfast was great. Lunch and dinner was good, but pricey compared to the many other cheaper and better restaurants within walking distance.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
903,Simply Amazing,50,April 2016,"This is the most wonderful resort I have stayed at! The staff were amazing and attentive. A special mention to the wonderful staff at the pool who were so great, always moving the umbrella for me so I didn't get burnt. Yoga was great and we loved the instructor. The rooms were so lovely. Could not fault this place at all. Oh and the staff will give you some food for the fish if you ask.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
904,"Cold towels, scented mister, cocktails and attentive pool staff- perfect swim !!",50,April 2016,"3 categories of rooms - all suites and all large & well appointed. Management, staff and services excellent - position: right on the beach with 3 cascading signature swimming pools. A luxurious escape with all the restaurants, shops, spas and facilities on your doorstep - perfect for a break from reality!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
905,Great Hotel,50,April 2016,Just had a brilliant week being pampered by the excellent staff here. Food and facilities all a high standard..Pool bar has a good value menu if you don't fancy the a la carte restaurant. Would recommend highly and will definitely return,The Legian Seminyak Bali
906,Perfection,50,May 2015,"The first word that comes to mind when I think of the Legian Bali is perfection! The attention to detail at this hotel is astounding - you can see true luxury in every detail. This is visible in every area of the hotel from the reception to the rooms, to the public areas - perfect! I could not think of a single thing to improve.

The location is outstanding as well - it’s walking distance to lots of fantastic restaurants. This was one of our favourite hotels we’ve ever stayed at hands down. Well done!

Stayed May, 2014.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
907,Almost perfection,50,April 2016,"Our second time at the hotel, and whilst expensive, this hotel oozes class and a great Balinese feel to it. We stayed with our family including two young children and the hotel was fantastic for them. The only thing lacking are ramps (and lots of steps) so it became quite burdensome lifting the pushchair over the steps even around the pool. However, the rooms are so luxurious, the breakfasts absolutely delicious (our grandson was spoilt rotten with waffles, pancakes, etc) and the three pools great for both adult swimmers and the kids.
The staff are delightful even to the point of helping you across the road.
Pure luxury, but with a very personal touch to it. Fantastic",The Legian Seminyak Bali
908,"Great start to our honeymoon, best service we received in Bali",50,August 2015,"We spent the first 4 nights of our honeymoon here last August. Incredible service from the check in to check out. We stayed in other top resorts while in Bali, but this was hands down the top service of our trip. Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful and the staff made an effort to learn our names and help us have a wonderful trip.

We loved the location as the beach was relatively private and quiet, but it was still only a short walk to restaurant, shops etc. We did walk to Kuta and back along the beach without trouble if you are ok with a longish walk.

We had a great room that was private and quiet. The breakfasts that were included were great, a combination of buffet and a la carte items were provided. The pool area was clean and private. We had 2 dinners at the hotel, 1 in the restaurant and the seafood buffet on the beach. The seafood buffet was terrific, we're so glad we did it, my husband isn't a huge seafood fan, but there was lots of other things for him besides seafood and he thought it was great. Our dinner at the restaurant was great, the food was terrific, but it's definitely more expensive than heading into town.

If we came back to Bali, we would definitely stay here again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
909,Total relaxation and chill-out,40,April 2016,I was very surprised with the level of English language understanding by all the staffs. They were all extremely attentive and always ready to help you in any way. I was very delighted to have Mr Frank Motzkus personally assisting to help with some dinner bookings outside of the hotel and suggest of some sight-seeing.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
910,Close to perfection!!!!,50,September 2015,"An eight night stay in possibly one of the best hotels we have stayed in, amazing facilities, very friendly and helpful staff, excellent service, beautiful beach, fantastic food, all the staff made our stay extremely enjoyable. I cannot fault this hotel. This is pure luxury in Seminyak. Can't forget the last day being upgraded to a luxury villa. Looking forward to my next visit to the Legian Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
911,Excellent way to start off Bali!,50,September 2015,"This hotel was absolutely beautiful and perfect - service was impeccable from pick up at the airport, check-in, room service, concierge, breakfast, and the pool bar. Views from the beach (particularly sunset!) are breathtaking. You can walk for miles on the beach and check out Seminyak. Traveling alone I felt very safe and enjoyed my trip immensely!

My only complaint was the light switches - very oddly placed and hard to figure out what switch turned off each light. That being said, light switches are a minor complaint :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
912,superb,50,May 2015,After a bad start due to the musty smell in the room- they had rain for several weeks- they moved us swiftly and we were delighted with our room. Breakfast was amazing the waffles with strawberries for breakfast were to die for. Evening meals good and so was the atmosphere lovely food. We did venture out and loved the Living room now closed and Moonlight a short walk away. Staff friendly and very helpful Hotel transport excellent. Highly recommend the spa the infinity pool fabulous and the beach beds really good,The Legian Seminyak Bali
913,Sensational service,50,April 2016,"The Legian is a phenomenal hotel that has everything. Beautiful setting right on the beach, large suites, a great pool, delicious food, all in a brilliant location just a stone's throw away from all the best restaurants, bars and shops of stylish Seminyak, but most of all, utterly brilliant level of service from every member of staff. The Legian is quite simply one of the best hotel experiences you can have.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
914,personal service and lovely atmosphere,50,March 2016,"We have stayed in villas in Semanyak many times. We tried the two bedroom suite at the Legian as a treat for our last holiday in Bali for a while, and we were very pleased with our choice. The service is excellent, staff always happy to help with any request or enquiry. All the staff speak excellent English and many greet you by name. The suite was huge and briliiantly equipped and serviced. Afternoon tea is available every day. We found the breakfast service calm and efficient. Highly recommend the Legian Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
915,Perhaps the best hotel that I have stayed in in my life ! Totally amazing,50,April 2016,"Words fail me in my praise for this incredibly run property. Don't be daunted by the slightly grim looking exterior ...Inside there is an incredible experience that awaits you.

917,Superb hotel,50,March 2016,"Stayed here for 4 nights and it was fantastic. It isn't cheap so one expects it to be good, and while the rooms are a little dated, I really cannot fault it. Rooms very comfortable, everything you need, excellent service, great food, and the pools are outstanding, with enough space for everyone and great views od the beach. Service around the pools is also excellent. If you can afford to stay here then do it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
918,The best hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2016,"The Legian is by far the best hotel in Seminyak! The spacious suite and huge terrace overlooking the idyllic gardens and lovely private beach was absolutely stunning!

The hospitality and friendliness of the staff were outstanding, they know every guest by the name.
Rooms were super clean and made up twice a day.
The attention to detail is amazing - The little poem on the bed every night and the lovely desserts and fresh fruits put out daily were fabulous. Free mini bar and snack were also included.

Breakfast was superb and the dinners were very romantic and classy with delicious food and wines.
Afternoon tea at the beach house- watching the beautiful sunsets was something not to be missed.

The hotel is located in a very good area with lovely shops and restaurants walking distance from hotel. Scooters are available for rent but the hotel arranged a driver and private car for day tours and it was very affordable.

Yoga in the garden daily, as well as a well-equipped gym and Spa was available - massages next to the beach were great!

The hotel also made our birthdays super special by serving champagne and cake!
Late check out was arranged as we had a midnight flight. This was much appreciated.

This is an outstanding luxurious hotel with the best of the best! Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
919,Wonderful hotel,50,January 2016,"This hotel was immaculate. The staff were exceptionally helpful, catering to everyone's needs. The location with direct access to the beach was wonderful, and the food cooked for breakfast and the meals we had at the hotel for lunch and dinner were fantastic. The spa facilities were wonderful and the amenities in the hotel were brilliant. A wonderful stay and fully recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
920,Heaven on Earth,50,November 2015,"This hotel is more than just charming, it's got everything you'd need for a holiday! The hotel restaurant is divine and the bar next to the beach offers the most amazing drinks. The infinity pool is super luxurious and a pleasure to spend the day in and out of. The rooms are huge with large terraces facing the ocean!

The staff are very very friendly and are always ready to help in any way they can.

The real key to this hotel is that they have the most comfortable beds in the world! I wish I could transport the room home with me.

The beach in front of the hotel is also very nice to swim in or take a long walk along the beach. It is worth the visit. We left refreshed and looking forwards to our next trip to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
921,AMAZING FOR WEDDING,50,June 2015,"My brother had his wedding in the Legian and I have to say everything was magical. The hotel itself is amazing - room spacious, food served was spectacular and there is an infinity pool near the beach! Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I even had a message at the spa and it was amazing. The best in Bali for sure.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
922,Beach-front luxury in Seminyak,50,March 2016,"The Legian in Bali is the real deal. Came with my family for a surf trip and everyone loved the hotel. Our room was very spacious and the prime beach-side location makes it perfect to chill on the beach and also go shopping and eating in Seminyak which is 5 minutes away. The breakfast buffet and restaurant food are top-notch, and the spa is great as well, though pricey given the plethora of cheap alternatives around the corner. Staff are all very friendly and efficient. Guests here are mostly families and older couples from the Western Hemisphere. The hotel is pricey, but you will absolutely get what you pay for, which is top luxury, comfort and convenience. Highly-recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
923,Amazing experience,50,March 2016,"We travelled as a family to celebrate our anniversary in Bali. We chose The Legian through the recommendation of some friends who had stayed there. The experience was outstanding from start to finish: the service with a genuine smile, the food, the magic of the hotel, the small details (including champagne and a chocolate cake as an anniversary surprise). They make you feel special from the first to the last day, they call you by your name and pamper you. That is what makes all the difference these days and you won't find many places like these.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
924,"A Great Location, Hotel and Staff",50,March 2016,"We have stayed at The Legian Hotel, Bali several times. We are drawn back by the superbly located hotel, great pools, on the best strip of beach and the superb, helpful friendly staff. Add the culinary skills of Australian born French trained chef Luke MacLeod and there is no need to leave the hotel to try outside restaurants. That gives a confidence to us on security. We never worry about security briefings in Bali as we feel as secure at The Legian hotel Bali as anywhere in the world.
For 5 star benefits, great food, smiling, friendly service, superb location, absolute security and relaxation we love The Legian Hotel, Bali. We are counting down the days to our return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
925,"Still the best of Bali, however slightly less than during past visits",50,March 2016,"With friends we stayed for the third time in this exceptional hotel, with beautiful suites and professional and friendly staff. Other than during the previous times the new management did not find an opportunity to introduce themselves. This lack of presence did surprise us.

The building starts showing some decline: in between the beautiful pools, tubes and an outside pump had been installed in order to deal with a malfunction or defect (judged by the tubes already for quite a long time). Parts of the wooden ceilings of the corridors were missing and other were partly bend. A hotel of this extremely high quality should however be impeccable.
Did it disturb us, did we enjoy The Legian less? No, it did not. We loved our stay and certainly we will return in case of a next visit to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
926,Still perfect!,50,March 2016,"20 years since I first stayed here and it just gets better! Perfect beachside location in Seminyak, close to most of the ""hot"" restaurants (Bambu and Sarong are musts), but don't miss the opportunity of dinner here. It is excellent food and service. INdeed the service here is what marks it apart from most - even in Bali where the friendliness is a trademark. NOw they've also added a 3rd tier of infinity pools to enhance that amazing view of the surf. ON this trip i also stayed at Alila Uluwatu, and I have to give them both 10/10.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
927,Pure Upscale Luxury,50,February 2016,We selected this property because of the excellent reviews on trip advisor and exceeded expectations!! Breakfasts were wonderful and diverse. Staff greeted us by name everywhere. Rooms were expansive and cleaned frequently. The beach was beautiful although had heavy surf. A fabulous resort and great reviews are well-deserved.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
928,Unbelievable.,50,March 2016,"The Legian was the most amazing place to stay with my four girlfriends but would also be with a partner and/or family. The staff stop at nothing for your comfort and experience. The facilities are brilliant, clean and always available for you to use. I highly recommend this hotel for an experience of Bali you will never forget.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
929,Quick trip,50,March 2016,"This was our second stay at the Legian and met all expectations. We were upgraded to a two bedroom suite with a huge balcony at check in and the manager Frank came by and introduced himself. The property was ery well maintained, service was first class and most of the employees called you by name. We can't wait to come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
930,1st class service in a 5 star setting,50,February 2016,"This hotel is faultless. From the moment you arrive until the moment you leave, you feel as though you are in your own slice of paradise. Only spent three days here but have spent every moment since, just wanting to go back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
931,Mood buster,50,March 2016,A lovely place to spend time with your family have a good view and very comfortable not to far from the airport a clean beach and the service is good a friendly neighborhood near to a shopping place and restaurants overall will be back to this place,The Legian Seminyak Bali
932,Honeymoon,50,April 2015,Had my honeymoon there and the hotel set up the room for the trip... romantic!! The place is wonderful! Love the location as around it have alot of shopping and food!!! It was also very calming. Would definitely come again for it,The Legian Seminyak Bali
933,One of Bali's Gem,50,February 2016,"This was our first visit to Bali and the Legian was a perfect choice to stay. The wait staff and chef, Maya the concierge, room service staff, front desk, our driver, spa technicians were ALL most accommodating and pleasant. Everyone greeted us with a smile. Frank, one of the managers came by our table at breakfast and introduced himself. Service was truly outstanding! The food was excellent and the choices were plenty. Be sure to have dinner in both of the restaurants. Our suite had a beautiful view of the sea and was very spacious. The mini bar was very generous with complimentary choices of drinks. The cookie/nut/chips jars were a real treat. Most of all the deserts and fruit that was left each night was amazing! You must try tasting the local exotic fruits. We enjoyed seeing the sunset from our balcony sitting on the sun bed. Afternoon tea is served each day and/or enjoy a cocktail at the bar or at your side as you watch the wave roll in. Thank you to ALL of you for making our stay most memorable!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
934,This hotel cannot be faulted,50,February 2016,"I have stayed at quite a few decent hotels in the past but this hotel is different. It is different because the service and attention they give to guests is quite outstanding. All the staff have an excellent understanding of customer service. Everything is done with a genuine smile and they all make you feel like royalty. The location is spectacular and watching the sunset is beautiful. The food is of a very high standard. Everything is taken care of. The food in the room service menu is as good as the restaurant. The suites are large and regal. This hotel cannot be faulted and I can see why it is one of the top 10 in Asia. Do not question it, just book and be prepared for an incredible experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
935,First class,50,February 2016,"I love to stay at The Legian when I stop through for business. The staff is excellent and the service first class. I have stayed there now many times and even though ownership has changed the level of service remains the same. Harry the new manager is a true professional. Their afternoon tea, whilst watching the sun set is not to be missed. Also best bed and sheets ever! First class all the way. Thank you",The Legian Seminyak Bali
936,A welcoming home when you're away from home,50,February 2016,"Generous. If I was asked what one word I felt best described the Legian, Bali, I would say Generous. The almost-all complimentary mini bar comes stocked with a staggering amount of soft drinks and juices (well over 20 items) which they'll happily replenish daily; a delightful selection of snacks are handsomely displayed on your kitchen counter, again, complimentary; and as soon as I scarf them down, more bite-sized taste treats seem to magically materialize.

A one-bedroom suite at this all-suite resort is substantially larger than I'm used to, and all with a gorgeous ocean-front view from an oversized terrace. It's evolved into something of a tradition with me to end each Bali trip with at least a night at this welcoming property and a great way to say goodbye to my favorite of all islands. Their generosity of unmistakably genuine spirit is the given expectation of the lovely Balinese, and here at the Legian, they demonstrate it in spades. Now off to a goodbye dinner at their beachfront restaurant.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
937,Excellent Service at a Great Location,50,February 2016,"We recently stayed at the Legian for 3 nights. Immediately before our stay, I received and email that the resort had changed ownership. This is always some what disconcerting since the ownership change was so fresh. Upon our arrival it was clear that I need not worry. The service and attention we received during our stay was out of this world.
Our room was excellent (#323)- a gigantic one bedroom with an ocean and pool view. I have never stayed in a larger room. There were even two toilets which I thought was a great feature. Our balcony itself was the size of some hotels rooms that I have stayed in. The pool was also exceptional, with prime beach views and access. I am not sure whether the hotel staff cleaned that stretch of the beach but it was notably cleaner than many other spots down shore on that beach. The pool service was superb with attentive staff ready to serve drinks and food poolside at any hour. I will also add that the hotel is in an excellent area- one in which we felt save walking around---lots of great restaurants and boutiques in walking distance. They also rent scooters (really nice Vespas) for anyone who is game to drive one around town and the rate was not too bad ($15USD for the day), though cheaper ones could surely be rented in town. One day we had planned to ride the scooters to Nusa Dua, but right about the time we went to leave, a large rain storm arrived. Within 10 minutes of requesting, a driver from the hotel arrived in a van to take us and and our 4 friends out to Nusa Dua. We decided not to stay long out there but on our way back we stopped at some shops instead. The driver was keen to wait for us to shop at our leisure. We really appreciated his willingness to go along with our last minute change of plans.

I think what stood out most to us during our stay was the incredible service that we received by the staff, especially the wait staff in the restaurant. After one morning of breakfast, the staff knew our names and specific coffee orders as well as when we would depart and where we were going after. We were truly impressed by their attention to detail.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
938,Superb Service ! But Overpriced!,30,February 2016,"My family and I were in Bali from 8/2/16-11/2/16. We chose to stay at the Legian Seminyak because of the many postive reviews posted on tripadvisor..
Initial impression was fantastic,the manager of the hotel came out to greet us,and the staff were very friendly.And from the lobby we could see the most amazing beach at the back of the hotel. After that we were brought to our 2bedroom suite. It was a great disappointment! At the price we were paying a night,the suite looks old and dated..there were no locks for the 2 bedrooms and in the ensuite master bathroom,a huge sliding door divided us from the dining table..definite lack of privacy. The second room was tiny and the toilet floor length window faces the common area. With only wooden shutters to shield us from prying eyes..I felt so insecure i had to cover the shutters with some towels..
Positive thing about the suite would be the wonderful seaview from the huge balcony with comfy lounge seats.The sound of the waves crashing onto the beach is mesmerising..The daily breakfast is good too,the buffet items change daily. And its a 10min walk out to shops,and restaurants..
As the hotel is 20years old,I think its time for some refurbishment to freshen the old beauty...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
939,sun beach & drinks,50,February 2016,"We stayed at The Legian for 3 nights from 06-09feb 2016. The hotel is very nice and clean. It will complete 20 years but it still looks young. The staff is really good and helpful and always running. We had a late night flight and the hotel upgraded us to a villa at THE CLUB for the last night and gave us a late checkout (which not many hotel does ). The Legain is more for children with lots of activities and kids playing but if you really need private time then The Club is the place to be. I have stayed at many 5 star properties in Bali but The Legain exceeded all my expectations. From complimentary minibar to free car to seminyak , all are worth staying here as these small things do make a big difference in your stay. Highly recommended and a must place to stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
940,A Wonderful Stay at the Club at the Legian,50,February 2016,"We recently returned from an 8 night stay at the Club at The Legian. This was a return visit to The Legian but our first staying at the Club. We normally stay in the Nusadua area or in rental villas even further afield but with the increase in traffic we started to find the trek to Seminyak (which we prefer for dining choices) was getting too long and bothersome, hence our choice this year of The Legian which is very centrally positioned in Seminyak.

We made a great decision and had a wonderful stay. The level of service at both the hotel and the Club was very high. The staff are incredibly warm hearted, sincere and eager to please. Senior management were very visible throughout our stay, greeting us at check-in and ensuring they spoke with us prior to check-out.

We tended to spend most of our days by the pool in the main hotel as it was very hot when we were there and the pool at our villa didn’t catch much of a breeze. Perhaps if we were there for just a few nights I would opt for a hotel room/suite with a balcony overlooking the beach but for 8 nights it was nice to have the change of scene from the main hotel to the villa and in the late afternoon/evening when it had cooled down a bit it was lovely to have our own pool to dip into. The outdoor area of the villa is completely private and large enough to be able to eat and sunbathe comfortably. We ate breakfast every morning at the main hotel which had a nice selection of buffet items and I appreciated that all hot items were a la carte rather than sitting in bain maries. We ate a few lunches at the hotel and what we tried was very good. There is also a restaurant in the Club Lounge which you can choose to dine at for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We didn’t really use the Club Lounge, as again with no sea breeze it was too hot (this could just be the time of year we were there and might not be the case in high season) and given the choice I prefer eating looking at the ocean than at a pool, which is the case at the Club Lounge. Again though it was nice to have the choice.

The inclusions that come with the villa I found to be very good and really enhanced our stay. In particular the daily laundry service and the complimentary car service around the Seminyak area were great. It was nice not to have the hassle of dealing with taxis and transport to and from restaurants or shopping. The evening cocktail and canapés from 6.00 – 8.00 pm were also very good. I was impressed that the choice of beverages was basically any cocktail or wine by the glass on the drinks menu. Our butler was professional and warm and again, as with all the staff at the Legian, very eager to please.

If I had to think of any negatives it would be that the villas only have queen size beds, the interiors of the villas are a little dark and I think the bathrooms could do with a refresh. But really these are nitpicking and they didn't affect our stay at all negatively. When next in Bali we will definitely return to the Legian for their wonderful service and great location.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
941,Huge Disappointment,10,February 2016,"My fligh arrived after midnight. I booked the hotel car but did not see the hotel sign. I had to phone the hotel to sort this out while surrounding by taxi driver soliciting business. When the hotel car arrived, it was a tired van. The room is just under US$600 per night even though I have checked in at about 2am. The 3-sided windows shown on the website are absent. instead only an about 5' wide full glass door to the tiny balcony. Not worthy staying for 7 nights at this price. Will check out tomorrow n go somewhere else. The welcome drinks n snacks look very good though.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
942,Superb stay in the Legian,50,January 2016,"We have beeb several times in this beautiful sited hotel. And it is a real pleasure to be here. The room, we had a deluxe suite, is spacious and nicely decorated. The king size bed sleeps excellent. The bathroom is tiptop. We used the broad bed outside on the balcony to enjoy tge view of tge ocean and to relax with a book before we were walking to the bar area . And enjoy there a snack with drinks while lying on beds with towels. Of course we went for a swim in the beautifull sited and warm pool.
The restaurant is rightly awarded. The wine list is fine with wines from all over the world.
And above all: the staff is very friendly and knows you by name!
We will come again!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
943,Paradise in Bali,50,January 2016,"I can truthfully state that the Legian was the most magnificent hotel in which I have ever stayed! The staff could not do enough and were most friendly. I was greeted by name every morning as I came down from my room for breakfast. The suite itself was perfection, the grounds and campus gorgeous. I had a wonderful spa experience as I relaxed by the pool area. The chef and guest chef for the special dinner prepared a wonderful culinary delight. The wine parings were marvelous.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
944,The best!,50,January 2016,"Don't bother looking any further the Legian Bali has it all and more. The hotel and grounds are stunning, set along the beach with pools overlooking the sea. The staff are just wonderful, nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast is perfect both the food and setting. We tried lunch once and that was excellent although with high tea we didn't really need lunch. We ate at the hotel in the evening once and that as high quality (some more light on or round the table would help). This hotel is perfect in every way from the moment they pick you up from the airport until you very sadly leave. One day I will return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
945,Sipping on Ice Cold Honey Ginger Tea,50,December 2015,This was a relaxing vacation from a long long long plane ride from the US. We had a seafood buffet the first night with all the fresh grilled seafood and meat. The meal was so good it actually convinced us to stay for dinner another night instead of going out (plus the fact we were so tired from traffic going around). It was a wonderful experience just dinning across the beach and relaxing with drinks after with the fire dancers that night. Staff was amazing throughout and we somehow made it back for tea service everyday. Completely recommend this hotel to stay in Bali & thank you for a wonderful stay.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
946,"Beautiful resort. Very friendly, helpful staff",50,January 2016,"Highly recommended - I had high expectations and they were exceeded. Beautiful beach and pool area. Spacious, immaculate rooms. Service was very good. Attentive, but not-at-all-intrusive staff. Hope to go again in the future",The Legian Seminyak Bali
947,"Stunning views, luxury and ease",50,January 2016,"Beautiful hotel with 3 stunning infinity pools overlooking a beautiful stretch of beach where you'll catch a gorgeous sunset every night there are no clouds.

We stayed here in mid January with a 5 year old and had a wonderful time.

Lovely huge room, beautifully appointed with stylish decor, still comfortable (warm woods, modern but not sterile). We had a garden room with a lovely terrace straight out onto the garden. The sound of waves crashing on the beach and stylish stone fountains on the lily pond filled the air. V relaxing.

Service was impeccable. Breakfast delicious - fresh fruit, eggs etc. as you'd expect from a top end hotel. Nice balance between selection and not being so large it felt impersonal. We also enjoyed the afternoon tea every day in the poolside restaurant.

Free surfing lessons at the lovely clean beach with large but not unpleasant waves. The beach occasionally had hawkers selling things walking along but they were never obtrusive or unpleasant and very quickly smiled and moved on when we said we didn't want anything.

Restaurants good, if a little pricey. We were less impressed with the Balinese restaurant at the Club, the Legian (over the road from the main hotel). Lots of nice places a short stroll away in Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
948,Amazing experience!,50,November 2015,"We had the pleasure of visiting the Legian in November 2015 for 4 nights as a couple. We highly recommend the hotel because of its exceptional service and attention to detail. It was so tempting to just stay there by the lovely infinity pool, enjoying stunning views and delicious cocktails. The room was beautifully decorated and spacious, with 2 balconies and even a small kitchen. All hotel grounds were perfectly taken care of and the staff remembered your name. The concierge helped us with suggestions (special thanks to Mr Motzkus) and bookings. We also enjoyed The Restaurant very much. Thank you so much for such a wonderful stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
949,slice of Paradise,50,January 2016,A tremendously luxurious hotel with an even better staff. Very friendly staff that learn your name and proactively try to make your stay comfortable. The dining is top notch. THere are about 8 different Koi ponds. they have scooters and bikes as well. the sunset and the infinity pools are perfect,The Legian Seminyak Bali
950,The Club at The Legian,30,December 2015,"We stayed in Villa 2 of The Club at the Legian to celebrate our honeymoon. The villas are located just across the road from the main hotel therefore there is no direct beach access however using the hotels facilities wasn't an issue.

Good:
- Very spacious one bedroom villa.
- Large private pool
- Privacy
- Complementary car service around Seminyak was useful
-Juni, the butler, was competent
- Good room service food
- Overall nice hotel grounds (pool, beach etc)

Bad:
-Bali musicians right outside of our villa made it very noisy every morning by 9am
-VERY noisy air conditioning unit
-Noisy waterfall from our garden (that couldn't be switched off) from 7am until evening
-Staff could do with a little bit more knowledge of English
-Spa is very basic (2 couple rooms only and no other amenities)
-Not enough attentiveness in replacing toiletries such as shower caps etc
-Uncomfortable bed",The Legian Seminyak Bali
951,Honeymoon Paradise,50,January 2016,"My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and loved it! The staff are incredibly polite and attentive, the rooms are spacious and the interiors are stunning. Whether eating in the restaurant or by the pool, the food is superb. When sitting by the beach, guests are given cold face cloths, face mist spray bottles and iced water. They also give you complimentary afternoon tea each day which is so lovely. They add all the little touches that makes your stay so enjoyable! We loved our time here and will definitely be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
952,Amazing,50,January 2016,"We came here on our honeymoon and absolutely loved it. From the moment we arrived you are made to feel welcome by the lovely staff. Nothing is a problem. The architecture is not too over the top and the interiors make it feel luxurious without being pretentious. We had dinner one night at the restaurant and it was the best meal we had in Bali. Better than all the celebrated restaurants.

Location is also amazing.

Whoever gave this hotel one star on the reviews needs their heads read.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
953,Never fails to impress,50,January 2016,"This is still my favourite hotel in Bali ( maybe the world !)
We only had a 2 night stay this time but the minute we arrived I was wishing we were able to stay longer. We were greeted as if we were old friends. We had 2 x deluxe suites which were located almost next to each other , we have adult kids so this was perfect. You certainly can't beat the constant sound of the ocean and the magnificent views that The Legian affords. The other great thing is that they are always busy in the down period upgrading facilities and making sure this hotel remains at the top of it's game.Staff as always excellent, although my children commented that they have relaxed the pool rules so that kids can jump into the pool from any location ( back in the day mine were never able to do this! ). Overall fabulous!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
954,Perfect,50,January 2016,"Great Service, Great Staff, Great Food , Perfect Rooms, Attention to detail is outstanding. Thanks for another great stay . Thank you also you the huge effort in seeing that our son got varied and excellent Gluten Free options through out the stay .
This hotel is in a class of it own ..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
955,"Luxurious, beautiful, tranquil paradise",50,December 2015,"I had the absolute pleasure of staying at the Legian for a week for NYE. Having travelled all around the world, no hotel has ever left such a beautiful impression on me. Absolutely everything was perfect, luxurious and the feeling was that of serenity and sumptuousness. However, the beauty is, there is no pretentiousness. I felt such a genuine personal touch. Every member of staff was loyal, genuinely caring. The location was divine, my room was beautiful. I very much hope to return to Bali just to stay again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
956,"Perfect, very nice memories",50,December 2015,"Fabulous hotel, excellent staff, easy to go out for dinner but the hotel restaurant is very nice and reasonable in price, smooth spa, good fitness room, everything was perfect in every detail. Good location. Our one bedroom Suite presented a stunning view. Personally I did not like the quality of the mattress. The yoga looked tempting but I missed it, will be back to try it out.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
957,Amazing,50,January 2016,"We recently spent 3 nights at the Legian and had an amazing time. It was our anniversary and on the day the front office manager arranged flowers, French champagne and even a cake for us, completely unexpected and out of the blue. Each and every team member new us by name and made us feel that we were the most important guests in the hotel. I can't say enough about this heavenly place and can't wait to get back there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
958,Totally exceeded expectations,50,December 2015,A truly magnificent Hotel. Detail was everything with exceptional service and pure luxury. Total beach frontage allowed you to escape and switch off . The weather was perfect and daily Yoga a total indulgence. The Legian Spa is one of the best the moment you walk in all the stress of your daily grind just disappears and allows the healing hands of the magnificent therapists to do their work. I can't recommend this Hotel enough it is truly unique and special.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
959,Exceptional Experience!,50,January 2016,"There is nowhere else in my opinion that compares the the Legian experience. The service is impeccable, the attention to detail and staff service is exceptional and the rooms are apartment sized. With Bali being so developed by Western chain hotel groups the Legian offers a true Balinese luxury experience with all the mod cons. My favourite hotel in the world!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
960,Legian Bali,50,January 2016,"This is a 5star hotel and service to match. The hotel is stunning and right on the ocean with a beautiful pool and plenty of sun loungers/beds. It is a calm and peaceful hotel where majority of guests were older, with a few young families. We were made t feel welcome and at home immediately by the friendly and professional staff.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
961,"Exquisite, far removed from the craziness of Seminyak",50,January 2016,"Seminyak can get a bit touristy and overrun. The Legian offers a nice reprieve from all the noise, markets and tourist trappings of the neighborhood. Our butler Yasa was beyond amazing. My husband got sick when we first arrived and he helped us bring in a team of medical professionals to help him get better quickly. He also expressed sincere concern for him and made sure that our stay was comfortable and memorable.
The hotel offers private tour services that are really amazing. You get ushered around in a comfortable SUV equipped with refreshments and even Wifi. The streets of Bali can sometimes be a bit treacherous- especially for someone like me who is not used to all the narrow streets.

Our driver was great. He took us to all the best spots in ubud and elsewhere. He was knowledgeable, respectful and didn't waste any of our time. We cannot say enough about him.

We were in Bali during what was supposed to be the rainy season, but it didn't rain at all. In fact, it was very sunny and a bit hotter than I expected. Most days, it was 95 degrees Fahrenheit

The Legian offers beautiful accommodations at ""the Club"" which is where we stayed. The one comment about the villa is that it was a bit dim in terms of lighting, but the space was luxurious. You have free refreshments and free local car service. You also have a separate club pool area and restaurant that is set aside only for those staying in the club villas. Really amazing. I highly recommend checking this place out for those who like beautiful and understated hotels by the water.

One thing I really noticed was how many families were around. Definitely a good place for kids.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
962,What a surprise,50,January 2016,"I figured it's a great hotel but upon check in we were upgraded for our anniversary trip to Bali
The room and view was outstanding
NYTimes, great wifi...everywhere!
Everyone knows your name and service to die for.
The most beautiful set of ponds and koi fish I have ever seen!
I counted at least eight ponds.....and they give you fish food
Lastly , the food and beverage director has this place going like clockwork.....polite, pleasant and super willing to make your stay special. Top top notch!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
963,Outstanding attention to detail,50,November 2015,"They thought of everything here, and we have high standards. The beds were so comfortable and every day was a treat. We came back to the room to find a poem on the pillow or a sweet treat in the room. Beautifully decorated rooms that were exceptionally clean and well maintained. The amenities were very high end products. All the staff were adorable. This place is not cheap, but you get what you pay for. Did i feel ripped off? No, not at all. Was I happy? Extremely. Would I go back? Within a heartbeat.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
964,Beautiful hotel with a lovely beach,50,December 2015,"The service was top notch, the staff were all friendly and helpful.

969,Consistently good,50,December 2015,"I still regard this hotel as best in Seminyak area despite personnel turnover. The new chef, which has huge boots to fill (his excellent predecessor went to Ritz) is very different good. Service attentive although F&B manager only introduced himself upon departure? Good pools and gym. Lunch menu much improved and breakfast solid even though it takes a while to get menu.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
970,Perfect,50,February 2015,"Everything was clean, comfortable and up to date. The staff were just excellent. Restaurant near the pool was fantastic - the Chocolate fondant lava cake is a must have for anyone that likes chocolate. 10/10",The Legian Seminyak Bali
971,Lovely Hotel In Seminyak Area,50,December 2015,"My family and i stay here for our second holiday to Bali, it was exceed expectation. Start from staff, All the staff really care to all of us, super friendly and charming.

The room was excellent, food also very good, my family and i will recommended to all of my friends to stay here. The location is near by KudeTa and Potato head on the beach but the building look old fashion hotel with rooms facing the beach but not on the beach. It is beautiful design Bali and modrn, recommended for families, very good service.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
972,Wonderful stay at the Legian!,50,December 2015,"Our family stayed at the Legian over the Christmas period on a recommendation from a good friend and fellow seasoned traveler. As we were looking for something extra special for our parents, we decided to book the Seminyak Suite - one of the larger 2-bedroom suites located on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool and beach. From the moment we arrived, we felt so well looked after - the staff are wonderful and a true highlight of this resort. I would go so far to say the service was the best my family and I have ever experienced (and we travel a lot). Yoni, our butler, was attentive, super pleasant and did a great job observing my family's likes and dislikes, leaving us with delightful surprises in our room every day (she even noticed my mom's love for rambutans and made sure our suite always had ample supply of it). The daily complimentary laundry service was also a very nice touch. The resort itself is certainly not the newest in Bali, but is a wonderful oasis located right in the middle of Seminyak's bustling eating and retail establishments. We were spoiled silly with food choices and never had to sit waiting in the infamous Bali traffic. Our absolutely favorite meal was the private BBQ dining experience the Legian organized for my father's birthday - it was definitely a meal all of us will remember for quite some time to come. A big thank you to Chef Luke and his team! We also took the opportunity to make a day trip to visit Legian's sister property in Ubud - the Chedi, which was absolutely beautiful. Thank you to Andre, Frank and his entire team for making our trip so special!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
973,One of the best hotels we stayed ever.,50,January 2015,"This place has it all. Service is incredible. For example, on check in our little boy (3 yrs) got fish food to feed the fish in de pond of the hotel lobby. Just one of those thing on which one can feel that this hotel thinks about everything. Spacious rooms on ground floor so that our little one could play on the lawn. Food, service and baby sitting was top notch.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
974,Still the best in Bali,50,December 2015,"We have stayed here since it opened, in various rooms, villas and the beach house. The staff here are very well trained and stay at the property, meaning that even though there have been numerous GM changes, the place still runs well.

Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
975,Exceptional,50,December 2015,"The Legian Bali is one of the most beautiful beach hotels we have ever stayed at. The architecture, interiors and grounds are gorgeous. The rooms are nicely appointed and the views from the 2nd floor balcony is breathtaking. The location of the hotel is perfect for getting to the beach or getting to shopping. And to say the service and staff are exceptional is an understatement.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
976,Best Hotel in Bali,50,August 2015,"We stayed at a lot of high-end and luxury hotels in Bali during our 2 month trip to the island. The Legian was by far the best. Villas are private, nicely decorated and spacious. Restaurants are beyond divine. Service is 10 out of 10. Location is between Legian and Seminyak, being close to both the high-end cafes and shops of Seminyak and the chill, relaxed atmosphere of Legian. Highly recommend the hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
977,Perfect holiday,50,December 2015,"Had the best stay at The Legian...we were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary n the hotel surprised us with a bottle of champagne, chocolate cake and canapés...the three course dinner was a gastronomic experience with excellent taste n presentation. Cocktails we had were a tad pricey but again tasted delightful...the spa offered the best massages I've had with a gorgeous view of the beach...even the cheapest room was very spacious n kept immaculately...overall the best way to celebrate our anniversary! Staff were attentive n very prompt with any request as well",The Legian Seminyak Bali
978,Perfect Honeymoon,50,November 2015,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at The Legian for 6 days on our honeymoon. All we can say is that it is outstanding in every way. We stayed in the villa, we had an absolutely amazing butler who's name was Sande. He was extremely nice and made us feel comfortable the moment we arrived. Even when i was not feeling well he would call the villa and ask how i was feeling. The villas were extremely beautiful. Very spacious and clean. We were greeted with a beautiful bathtub filled with flowers, a champagne bottle and a special honeymoon cake. Also the bed was beautifully decorated. The food was delicious at every restaurant that we ate at the hotel. The beach is beautiful and the pool was divine. Even the service by the pool was amazing. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone, it takes the cake when it comes to luxury and service. Absolutely perfect for a honeymoon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
979,Amazing,50,December 2015,"We had a wonderful time, the staff could not do enough. The Villas were beautiful and provided complete privacy. Best restaurant was the Idonesian Bambu. Bar Ku De Ta also excellent. Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

We will absolutely return again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
981,Best hotel in Seminyak,50,December 2015,"It's not often I write a review whilst still staying at the place; but here goes....If you are going to stay in Seminyak this IS by far the best hotel to stay in. It still clings to traditional Bali ways & features where in some of the newer hotels you could be staying anywhere in the world. The staff are gracious, the food is delicious & the pools are clean & perfect for watching the world go by. It's close to everything if you want to shop or head out to a nearby restaurant. It's also the perfect place to do nothing. A great room for 2 bedrooms is 231. Stay at this place if you can! They also have complimentary yoga!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
982,A GREAT BEACH FRONT LUXURY HOTEL,50,November 2015,"We chose The Legian as our last hotel on our 10 day Honeymoon and are really glad we did. Legian is 5 star all the way!

The room was lovely, they gave us a 2nd floor room facing the ocean and had perfect views of the sunset. I loved all of the little extras (they provide a beach bag for you to use and I did everyday!)....the toiletries in the bathroom were great, they have the bath set up with a candle, loofah and even scented salts. Robes, slippers, iPod and speaker system, just great all around.

From the time we stepped foot in the hotel, the staff were great and the architecture and layout of the hotel including the infinity pools were awesome! We spent everyday at the pool, where there are numerous day beds and beach chairs to choose from. The staff is great and will come right over to put down your towels, set your umbrella up and bring you cold water and cold towels. The beach is right there and it was amazing to go from beach to pool (there are outdoor showers near the pool to use between that we loved).

Don't miss the 4-6pm tea time! They bring you a cup of hot tea and some bite sized treats (which were so yummy!). We took it by the pool everyday, but I think you can do it in the restaurant or bar too.

We loved the staff here and their attention to detail, from our welcome (a bottle of champagne and chocolate dessert wishing us a happy honeymoon!) to the staff who cleaned our room during the day and then did a turn down service in the evening (and usually left us a flower with a poem and some treat!).

The food at the hotel was great, my only complaint would be that they have a bit of a limited menu and I was a bit tired of the breakfast by morning 4 but this is not a deal breaker since you are in Seminyak and are walking distance from many great restaurants!

Note: our AC in the room was good but we had to leave it at 20 degrees (celsius), kinda chilly or it would become very humid in the room- I learned this the hard way when I put it up to 25 degrees and the it got so humid that the first night we needed the sheets changed out because they were damp. Just leave it on at that temp though and you will be fine.

ALSO, the service is wonderful. The concierge called around to restaurants to make us reservations and we booked our hotel transport through the hotel. Even in the end the attention to detail was great- they had wifi in the car and bottles of water waiting for us. This hotel is wonderful!

Love The Legian and hope to be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
983,Simply Exceptional,50,November 2015,"My wife and I are experienced travelers, having spent the last 15 years living and working internationally. We've been fortunate enough to stay in magnificent hotels and resorts around the world, including Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula, Oberoi, and Waldorf Astoria properties. I mention this merely to place my review into context. The Legian is in a class of it's own. It's not the fanciest, or the newest, or the hippest establishment around, but for understated elegance, faultless service, outstanding food, and superb location, it cannot be beaten. In short, The Legian doesn't excel in any one particular area, it excels in everything. It is the complete package. It's very difficult to strike the right balance between informality and exclusivity, and very few establishments are able to carry this off. The Legian does so with aplomb. Service from every department was consistently impeccable. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny. This has now become our default go-to destination when we want an indulgent, relaxed, chill out beach holiday. We'll be back. Again and again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
984,AWESOME EXPERIENCE!,50,November 2015,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel. My husband and I has a week long stay at the Legian and it was pure paradise! There is so much to say, I will break it down by category...

Environment - Relaxed Balinese style which is cozy and comfortable. The place keeps its traditional feel, but still feels modern and new. The grounds are immaculately clean and landscaping perfectly manicured. I call it understated luxury.

Rooms - we had the lowest grade studio room, and it was HUGE!!! Plenty of living space, huge bathrooms and 2 closets! We never had a problem with the wifi and it was so quick! The bed are so comfortable and the pillows were wonderful. I think the pillows were memory foam, but they were so comfortable. I loved that you could hear the sound of the waves at night while falling to sleep. The housekeeping came twice a day and were always so detailed oriented. They left small treats at night for us. Complimentary snacks were always refilled daily and refreshments always replenished. Rooms overall were immaculate!

Pool Area - There is not a bad spot in the pool/beach area. Every spot had breathtaking views of the ocean. The pool attendants were very attentive always refilling our water and moving our umbrellas around to accommodate the strong sun.

Food - Breakfast was scrumptious every day. Service was highly attentive and anticipated our every need. Eggs, bacon , fruits and breads were always fresh.
The lunch by the pool was a bit expensive but the food was delicious.
We enjoyed the complimentary tea time each afternoon which was a nice treat!

Spa - So reasonably priced! Take advantage of the specials! I went to the same massage therapist 3 times in 1 week. The cost i paid for 3 massages totaled up to 1 massage i would have paid for in the US. You will be tempted to try the small spas outside of the hotel, but there is no need to venture out. If you like deep, firm massages - Eka is your guy!

Gym & Yoga - Great workout facility with welly equipped machines. Complimentary yoga classes by the beach were excellent!

Location - We loved the location! Seminyak is a busy town with a ton of bars, restaurants and shops. The hotel was convenient walking distance from everything we needed! Ku De Ta Beach Club is right next door - great for dinner! Don't forget to try Urchin for dinner which is also walking distance.

Service - TOP NOTCH!...Every employee in this hotel deserves 5 stars for their courteous, friendly, respectful and prompt attention to every guest.

Overall, this was a rather pricey place, but I never felt like they tried to ""nickel and dime"" their guests like other expensive resorts. There were nice touches to appreciate the guests like complimentary tea times, snacks and welcome a cocktail night with no additional charge. The price we paid was worth every penny.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
985,"spoiled bliss on the beach, so great we only left once in 4 nights",50,October 2015,"just thinking about this place makes me want to go back right now. we had a busy and long trip with several active destinations (27,000 air miles) so by the time we got to Bali we needed some r and r and wow this was over the top. it was an anniversary trip so we upgraded to a pool villa at the club which is a separate structure from the hotel itself and oh was it perfect. we arrived after midnight and had a wonderful welcome tea of ginger and lemongrass and then were escorted to our lovely ""compound"" seriously you can't call this just a room. you open the gate to a beautiful courtyard and pool along with a large outdoor dining table and a small kitchen for your butler. once inside there is a nice seating area, great bose sound system with an iphone that has every album made on it, the beautiful bed in the center enclosed in light curtains and then a huge dressing area with a large shower and a super large outdoor tub on the other side of it. there was a bottle of bubbles (anniversary gift) and a platter of appys in the room which included smoked salmon, foie gras and a few other goodies which we decided to stay awake and consume which was a great decision. club benefits are included in our rate which meant free breakfast, afternoon tea which adds in some sweet and savory snacks and happy hour each night. the hotel itself is beautiful and we did check out a 1 bedroom suite for future stays and it would be great. GHM knows how to do breakfast which is always a buffet of fruits, pastries, meats, fish and cheeses, fresh juices, salads and about 5-6 varieties of local foods along with whatever you want from the menu. the setting looks over the 3 pools and then the ocean which is so beautiful. the staff knew our names when we arrived and after the first breakfast knew exactly how we liked our coffee. after breakfast its time to lounge by the pool in the most comfy day beds, some of which are right over the beach, a nice cold towel, waters and the most delish cashews arrive and then its nap time. later in the afternoon they send around a few snacks to try before tea time starts. our butler Juni was so wonderful, knew just what we needed before we asked for it and even fixed the button on the hubby's shirt. she took great care of us and the rest of the staff was also perfect. the food was fantastic and we ate local specialities each night and usually passed on lunch as the breakfast and their snacks was enough. wonderful spa treatment and perfect double room for couples with attached room for dressing and shower. we literally left the place just once for dinner out and couldn't wait to get back to our ""retreat"" this was my favorite hotel of all for our month long trip. can't wait to go back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
986,Short Stay,50,November 2015,"My wife and I absolutely loved this place. Their attention to detail is by far the best. The room was outrageous, the staff the best I've encountered and the food was beyond expectations. I am a chef so that meant a lot to me. We only planned 1 night and both agreed we wished we stayed longer.
I'm now looking at the company GHM hotels and would plan a trip around them they are that good!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
987,Amazing stay from beginning to finish!,50,August 2015,"Absolutely amazing, loved every second of our stay at this gorgeous hotel!

We stayed for 7 nights for our honeymoon, and what a beautiful experience. The breakfast buffets were out of this world, really felt like king and queen with the quality of the service in this hotel!

Afternoon tea was lovely everyday, adds a really lovely touch!

Thank you to those at the legian for adding special touches for our honeymoon",The Legian Seminyak Bali
988,Still a wondrful place for a relaxing and pampered tropical vacation,50,November 2015,"I'm not sure how many times we've stayed here. We keep coming back to The Legian Bali for much needed breaks from our busy work lives back in Perth. We arrived home late last night from a week at The Legian. I was so very happy to see some of the same people we had met at the hotel on our prior stays (right back to 2011). These dear people are relaxed, intelligent and have a very high level of professionalism and they aim to ensure our vacation is smooth and comfortable in every way possible. These dear people are the backbone of the service which ensures our vacation is everything we need. Thank you so very much for making our holiday wonderful to everyone who works at The Legian Bali. The beautiful location and fantastic property will never disappoint us. Our 26 year old son who stayed with us again this time was in heaven. He works hard too (a full-time job as well as completing difficult university studies) and the stress he had endured as he finished final undergraduate semester just fell away from him last week - he is a big fan of the eggs benedict - one with ham and one with salmon. My husband was very in need of a relaxing break from work and being able to swim, read a novel and rest in our beautiful two bedroom suite was wonderful. Needless to say I felt totally spoilt and had a brilliant vacation. With the AUD being so rough compared to the USD, this was our most expensive stay, and I have to say if the AUD dives to a very low rate, we may have to ration our stays to every two years. Hopefully we can plan our stay around a favourable exchange rate and come again next year.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
989,A Gem Find In Busy Seminyak,50,November 2015,"The Legian's main restaurant came highly recommended by our friend.

And we're glad we had dinner here, and even got to meet the affable chef Luke!

He and his kitchen team served us their best plates in a multi-course dinner. And did we mention we got the most romantic table in the house? The table for two was right in front of the shoreline, where the waves and blanket of stars added magic to our private dinner outdoors.

We loved everything from start to finish, especially the mouthful of fried sardine, big juicy steak and sea urchin cappucino. The flavors were kept light and delightful. Make it even better with wine pairing.

We hear that the multi-course chef's menu is refreshed regularly and priced around IDR700,000 per diner. It's so affordably priced for five-star service and quality produce.

Thanks again, The Legian and chef Luke!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
990,"Superb hotel - great location, staff and room.",50,November 2015,"This hotel is great. This was our first visit to Bali and we had had to endure some nervous days wondering if we would get there from HK due to the volcanic ash cloud but we did. We had arranged to be picked up at the airport by the hotel - unfortunately there are so many people at the airport to collect guests - that it was initially hard to find the driver but once we did - this was fine. The service from all the staff was superb - there is a large number of staff to support guests. Nothing was too much trouble and almost all the staff seemed to know our names and use them during our visit. The hotel is on the beach and the views are great. We had a 2 bedroom suite which was fabulous - it was massive. Acqua di Parma toiletries are great too:) The breakfast was great and this was included in the price that we had booked. The hotel is expensive and alcohol is also expensive - wine is significantly dearer that spirits and beer. The pool, beach, gym and spa were all great. It is very easy and safe to walk to restaurants, bars and shops from the hotel. We ate out most nights in restaurants outside of the hotel and they were all good. There are also spas outside who provide manicures for £5. The hotel arranged a driver for us one day and we visited a waterfall, a temple and a rice field - this was a great way to see some of the areas outside of Seminyak. This cost was approx £50. The money takes a while to use - 100,000 Indonesian Rupiath = £5. We were flying back to HK late in the afternoon but were given the use of a courtesy room which was a one bedroom suite which was also great. I would really recommend this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
991,"Overall Fantastic, But....",40,November 2015,"We are nearing the end of our stay at the Legian and while it was fantastic for the most part, the end of our stay has been a bit disappointing. We had a fantastic room that we were very pleased with (435) with significant privacy, unobstructed view of the beach/sunset and lovely layout, but our A/C broke down in the middle of the night last night-- so had to call in housekeeping/front desk at 1am (it was pretty brutal and humid). They were unable to fix it, graciously (and this is a special 50th bday trip and all he wanted was to have his nice terrace with private sunset-- hence my requoffered us to sleep in an alternative room, but my partner was still asleep-- so didn't want to wake him and opted to stick it out and they would fix it in the morning. We went to breakfast first thing so they could fix it, but unfortunately was informed it was not able to be fixed and we would have to move rooms.... no problem, we get it and packed up the little stuff and they said they'd do the rest. The assistant GM offered us a free dinner at the resort (very nice... we already have dinner plans elsewhere while we are here... but thoughtful)-- however once we returned from now have view of the cocktail bar, trees and the hotel cocktail reception this evening-- and a constantly running toilet that needs to be fixed. I sought out the Assistant GM to express my disappointment in the new room and he said that was what was available-- umm, the resort has been 1/4-1/2 full all week... it's been empty. Alas, we will now spend the remainder of our vacation with an obstructed view and listening to crying babies.. such a disappointment. We purposely sought out the Legian to stay again after our last trip which was wonderful.

Overall-- the employees from the restaurant, pool, front desk, housekeeping have been outstanding and had this room issue not arose, I would have given 5 stars and recommend to anyone as the property is beautiful... but this snafu which was ""out of their control"" as stated to me, prompts me to consider elsewhere for future Bali trips.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
992,My favorite Hotel,50,November 2015,"This is my second time staying here. The hotel is amaaazziinnggg , the view , decoration the beach and most of all the amazing staff. Very helpful, all knowing your name and always smiling. One of the best spa here, And free yoga classes every Morninggggg on front of the water. Our room was on the 3rd floor. Breath taking once you walk in the room, comfortable and elegant. You sleep And wakeup witz the sound of the Waves thaïs is privées les. Thaïs os THE BEST Hotel on Bali .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
993,Wonderful,50,August 2015,"We spent a week at the Club at the Legian in August. It was pure luxury from the moment we were picked up from our previous hotel, to the moment we waved farewell to our driver at the airport. Nothing is too much for the wonderful staff who are friendly, knowledgeable and so helpful. Within a couple of days all staff at the Club and the main ones at the main hotel had taken the trouble to learn our names and had our preferred breakfast tables and sun loungers picked out for us as soon as they saw us approaching :). We stayed at villa 5 which was absolutely luxury and our butler Arisna was fantastic throughout. On hand whenever we needed and provided us with a 5 star service, thank you again Arisna!

I couldn't recommend The Legian any higher. A truly magnificent place to stay. We will be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
994,A feeling of true luxury,50,November 2015,"Our stay at The Legian was great in every sense.

The room:
We stayed in room 423 in the right wing of the hotel. The room was very spacious with a separate kitchen and a bedroom with direct access to a huge bathroom and the terrasse. The bathrom had two separate wash basins as well as a showerroom, toiletroom and a bathtub. The terrasse included a table with chairs and a daybed, which we used every evening watching the sunset.

The staff:
The staff is professional and helpful but still have the friendly kindness as Balinesians are famous for. Henry and Adi at the beachfront were great and really treated us. Most staff quickly remembers your name and what are your favorit drinks, food etc. The place has its own security personel and lifeguard duty.

The food:
We only had breakfast and lunch at the hotel and both were good. The breakfast is abundant and you can order whatever you like. The lunch meny at the beach could have included more dishes but was good enough for our use. A new pizza oven is currently being built in the right wing bar.

The location:
The location is about the best you can get in Seminyak. It is beachfront and close to most of the best rated restaurants in Seminyak, also close to Seminyak square and shopping. Great pools and fantastic sunset view.

Pros:
Beachfront
Staff
Rooms
Luxury feeling

Cons:
If you don't get a room on 3 or 4 floor iyour sunset view will be obstructed by palm trees.
If you are looking for a nice swim in the ocean you are in for a tough ride in the BIG waves. However, the pools are great and compensate a lot for the ocean swim.

All in all, a fantastic place to spend your vacation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
995,Outstanding service,50,November 2015,"Everything was perfect... Room, service, food. Loved it there. Only bad thing was the beach was unswimmable because of large currents but that was the case for all of seminak. Walking distance from potato head and ku de ta also a plus.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
996,The best,50,September 2015,"Had a bungalow,clean tidy and air conditioned . Right across the road from the beach, and 2 minutes from the hustle of the shops if you want.staff were great.free breakfast was outstanding..overall a fantastic place to stay.well worth the 5 stars.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
997,Mine all mine....,50,November 2015,"Amazing service, amazing hotel, amazing location and amazing little surprises. From renting a scooter to planning a day out, to our wedding anniversary, The hotel and staff left no detail out and kept their service above and beyond. It's no wonder the average staff working at the legian has been with the hotel for 10yrs or more. Great sense of pride and everywhere we go, the locals who were told where we stayed, had nothing but great reviews of the place. As a young couple, it's not for the 'happening crowd' and is suited for those who really want the beach and hotel to themselves amongst those who just wanna sleep in the shade and be pampered.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
998,Best Resort in Bali. Period.,50,November 2015,"Most relaxing resort I’ve been to anywhere in the world. Period.

If you are thinking about Bali and where to stay, look no further. If you want the best you will pay for it and it’s worth every penny.

I spent 4 nights here and it was worth the long trip from Texas.

Location
Absolute perfect location in Seminyak. Can walk to everything and anything you want. If you stay in the Club section, you have car service anywhere you want to go in the area. I really didn’t leave the resort much as there was no need to go out really. But if you want to enjoy the nightlife or restaurants, they are in your backyard.

Wifi
Had Wi-Fi everywhere in the resort. Hotel, beach, pool, etc. Very strong signal and easy to use.

Club vs Hotel
I stayed in the Club (across the street) and it’s worth the extra cost. You get a butler, daily tea, free drinks for two hours at night at the Club or main hotel(and this is a great feature), open mini bar (beer, soda, snacks, hard liquor—all included). You get a butler to take care of all your needs, breakfast at the Club or main hotel or room, private pool, car service, etc. It’s about a 30 second walk to main hotel and security even blocks the street so you can cross. I loved it and would HIGHLY suggest staying at the Club vs main hotel. Much quieter, private, personal attention and all of the benefits I mentioned.

Food
Restaurants were great. At the Club they have a private restaurant which I ate dinner several times. Breakfast I would walk to main hotel and watch the ocean while eating breakfast every morning.

Drinks
Drinks in Bali are not inexpensive, but at the Club I got 2 hours of ‘free’ drinks every night (from 6-8PM). It worked out great to watch the sunset every night with unlimited drinks.

Pool
Pool at the Club is almost always empty and larger than main hotel pool. Of course I spent the time at the main hotel due to ocean view. Pool area is not crowded and no need to fight for chair space. Decent pool service and I ate lunch in my chair everyday.

Kids
Yes, this is a kids friendly resort, be warned. However, I have to say, most were very respectful and well behaved. However, there are quite a few of them, so as a single person I did get a little worried. Again at the Club zero kids I saw.

Staff is very friendly and helpful. At the Club it gets even more personal and almost like staying with friends.

Overall the resort is simply stunning and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Bali. If you want the best-of-the-best, this is your place hands down.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
999,Relax,50,November 2015,"Great hotel food service and location
Pool and beach at front in garden setting spread out for comfort .great out door bar and snack area
All staff very accommodating and attentive to your needs going back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1000,Pure Bliss,50,November 2015,"Just spent 3 nights at The Legian and I could not have thought of a more perfect place to be stranded because of the Ash cloud.

We were fortunate to be upgraded to The Legian Suite which was simply the most amazing room with a beautiful huge terrace overlooking the pool and beach...pure bliss.

Everything about this hotel was perfect..the location...the food...the spa.....the pool....the staff.....everything.

Cannot wait to come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1001,Superb service from such nice and helpful staff,50,October 2015,"We stayed 5 nights at The Legian. Hotel is really nice and we had a Deluxe Suite overlooking the sea. Everything was as you would expect of a 5 star hotel but the service was really superb. Everyone was so attentive and helpful. Impeccable manners and many of the staff we spoke to have worked for the hotel for many years which sort of tells you how well they look after their employees and thus happy staff with smiles on their faces all the time. We really enjoyed our stay at The Legian and will hopefully one day pass by and stay again. Finally, must mention the bed as it was so comfortable and slept very well.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1002,Will always return,40,October 2015,"We have stayed at this hotel for 10 years which says it all. Great service, excellent food and we love the large rooms. Breakfast is a treat and the location and view cannot be beaten. The fact they remember your names, and have same staff yr on yr is great. The afternoon tea is a treat as are the little plates they put in the rooms. Well done to the staff who can make or break a hotel",The Legian Seminyak Bali

1004,Simply the best: amazing honeymoon @ The Legian Bali,50,October 2015,"We have joined “The Legian Bali” in October 2015 to celebrate our honeymoon.
The hotel is overwhelming and the perfect place to spend vacation in the area of Seminyak!
All employees were very kind and we’d been impressed to be addressed by our names all the time.
The breakfast was served till 11 am (mostly a bit longer) and we had been always asked to order eggs in different variations to get them prepared fresh. As we also joined the Ocean Bar for a fish barbecue, we can say that all over the quality of the food was excellent.
At the pool / beach area the chairs had been arranged for us with towels and there was an excellent service as well.
We stayed at a one bedroom suite and enjoyed the luxury suite with two balconies (one with a day bed and ocean view), a bose sound system, two iPods, a very comfortable bed and our wellness bathroom.

Therefore we can recommend this incredible amazing hotel for 100% and we are sure to come back again!

Thank you for making our honeymoon unforgettable!

Hope to join you soon again “The Legian Bali”!

1005,Balinese chic (at a price),50,February 2015,"We recently spent a few nights here as part of a round Bali trip and boy is this place special. Just have a look at the photos on the website and you get an idea of the place. We stayed in the cheapest studio and I can't believe how big it was. We were on the top floor north corner and we had two terraces one with sunbeds the other a table and chairs, the room itself is 'L' shaped which means you get three rooms a living/dining room a bedroom and a bathroom with all the amazing little extras that the world traveller has come to expect, multiple flat screens a Bose sound dock and great eco toiletries. I don't know how busy the hotel was but the only people we saw were staff who are constantly sweeping and dusting the public spaces. We opted for room service breakfast which was huge and delicious though we did have dinner in the restaurant one night, it was 'fish' night and the choice was breathtaking. As a bit of a splurge I would heartily recommend this place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1006,Out of this world,50,October 2015,"Simply stunning. Great location, great hotel but above all else it's the staff that make the difference. We stayed in 'The Club' across the road from the hotel. It is more exclusive and you get a private pool with your very spacious villa. The service is simply world class. We spent all our time across the road at the main hotel using the beach front facilities and in reality with kids it is better to be based across there. The pools and the beach are fantastic and all the staff address you by name. The gym and spa are wonderful as well. The food is 5 star just like everything else. We have been to Bali 10 or so times mostly staying in villas. We had got a little tired of it but The Legian has changed all that. Simply stunning and we will be back. Thank you to the staff in particular.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1007,Perfect Hotel!,50,October 2015,"We stayed at The Legian last week and cannot say enough about it. It is among the best hotels that we have ever stayed in. We would give it 6 stars if possible. Our room was upgraded to a suite which was huge! Two bathrooms, a full dining room and even our own sound system. The room had a private terrace that overlooked the spectacular gardens and ocean and, being on the ground floor, we could walk straight out to the deck chairs overlooking the ocean. The service at the resort was perfect. Everyone was so friendly and accommodating. We were greeted with lovely appetizers in our room upon arrival and special treats and fruit were delivered daily. The 3 tiered infinity pool was to die for and we spent a lot of time there. The poolside service was amazing as well - fresh ice water and cool towels delivered regularly and even afternoon tea service at our deck chairs! The restaurant overlooking the pools and ocean served the best food we had in Bali and the view at night with the waves crashing in was simply amazing - definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have ever been at. The hotel had candles everywhere at night and the resort looked like a fairly land all lit up and glowing. We had reservations to eat elsewhere in Seminyak, but canceled them and had dinner 3 nights in a row at the hotel's restaurant - we liked it that much. We cannot recommend this hotel more highly. It was one of the highlights of our trip to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1008,So pampered!,50,November 2014,It was 4 nights of pure bliss in the Legian! One of my best Bali experiences! We stayed in the club villas which had our own private pool and butler. The villa was very well maintained and the pantry very well stocked! Staff were very accommodating and attentive. I miss it already!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1009,Fabulous hotel,50,September 2015,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a 2 week stay in September. On arrival we were looked after until our suite was available.

We loved everything about our stay from the lovely suite, fantastic breakfasts, pool area, lunches overlooking the beach and we are already planning a return trip next year.

The level of service was exceptional, everyone greeted us by name. We must make special mention of the team by the pool who were excellent including Taufik the lifeguard who provided my husband with lots of interesting information about scuba and local conditions.

Best parts

1. Amazing service
2. Superb breakfasts, the eggs benedict were fantastic
3. Service by the pool, afternoon tea was lovely every day
4. Spacious suite.
5. Proximity to some great restaurants.
6. Restaurant for dinner amazing!

Looking forward to next year.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1010,Just what we needed,50,October 2015,"My hubby and I just got back from a 6 night break in Bali. I was so impressed with the hotel especially as they upgraded us to a deluxe suite. The suite was very roomy and had a lovely view from the balcony out to the pool and ocean. The staff were exceptional and made us feel very welcome. Nothing was too much trouble . Hubby was pleased with the Internet connection as he had some work to do. The food was amazing and I particularly liked the afternoon tea with the yummy cakes, pastries and savoury snacks. Very good location if you are interested in trying the local restaurants and for shopping. I would definitely go back to The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1011,Complete luxury,50,October 2015,"We just had a 5 day stay here at the hotel and were so impressed with everything.
The staff here are excellent, from remembering the way you like your coffee every morning, helping you at concierge with restaurant bookings or bringing iced water to you while sitting by the pool.
Given the hectic streets of Seminyak, this is an oasis to escape to, conveniently located near great restaurants, a 5 minute walk to Seminyak Square, around the corner from Bodyworks Spa.
During our stay, it was really quiet, though I am sure it does get more busy during school holiday periods.
I would highly recommend this hotel for people looking for total relaxation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1012,Honeymoon heaven,50,October 2015,"My husband and I visited this hotel on our honeymoon, it was our third and final hotel of our holiday.
Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly staff, we were given a free room upgrade and bottle of champagne and also a cake due to the occasion of our stay which was a lovely touch. Our room was huge, modern but still with a traditional feel about it. The room had a Bose sound system with an iPod containing thousands of tracks. You get free soft drinks and some snacks in the room which was really handy.
I think the service in this hotel really makes it stand out from others, all the staff addressed us by our names from the minute we walked into the hotel. You couldn't move a muscle by the pool without them offering to move the shade or get you a drink.
We were given a couples massage as part of our honeymoon package and the spa was really lovely, great massage listening to the waves crashing.
I think this hotel was well positioned, the beach is a surf beach, not picture postcard but certainly good fun body boarding and taking long walks along the sand. Seminyak itself has plenty of places to eat and drink, a few we enjoyed were bambu, kudeta and the red carpet champagne bar.
One thing I would note about this hotel is there isn't much going on in the evening, perhaps they could use the pool bar more.
On the up side we did see some baby turtles on the beach one night which really did top off a great holiday.
We would certainly like to return to this hotel and enjoy the amazing service which is second to none",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1013,Honeymoon perfection!,50,October 2015,"Wonderful hotel with its cosmopolitan feel and interiors, triple infinity pool, and prime location on the sandy beach. Service was first class (attentive but not pushy). Room excellent and really comfortable. The breakfasts were really delicious and a good variety. We even got to see baby turtles on the beach!! 10/10",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1014,Quality uncompromised... so far,50,September 2015,"As soon as I learned that there was a change of management at The Legian, I immediately booked another holiday with them: I wanted to experience the exceptional level of service while the inertia of the old management who had managed to achieve the outstanding quality of service at this place was still there... I am happy to report that so far, there are few signs of deterioration. The service is still from the other world and the other era, and the good old Legian still looks and feels exactly the same as before. Whether it is owing to the inertia from Kevin/Rohaan rule of iron management or the new management's input, is hard to tell. I shall hazard a guess that it is the former rather than the latter though. The Thursday's management cocktail reception is gone now, so is the cozy feeling the (regular) guests used to have that they know the management personally. During my lengthy stay this year, I haven't seen new management once, not even the regular stroll around the property checking that all was OK... Obviously, it is a different style of management when those in charge are not to be seen... I wish them all the success and do hope they will triumph. The chef (Luke McLeod) is the last man standing that connects the present with the glorious past of The Legian and I very much hope this connection, and particuarly its importance for the regular guests, is fully appreciated by the management. His cuisine is inventive and provoking as ever, his staff are impeccably trained, and he still recognises and welcomes familiar faces of the regular punters as friends.

I was very glad I'd made this trip. What The Legian's standard is would be hard to describe to anyone who has never experienced it, and, as I have already said before, it is still there. The ever attentive staff impeccably trained to be non-obtrusive at the same time still demonstrates the scary art of mind-reading: they do remember what particular brand of beer one likes to have at 1pm even if the last time one had enjoyed it was over a year ago, they still could easily become instanteneously invisible while remaining ever-present and materialise at the first call at the same time. You still enjoy your afternoon tea on the beach without ever reminding them that you take your green tea without sugar and like your petit four to be brought with the tea and not 5 minutes later. They still demonstrate this uncanny trick of knowing exactly what you want and anticipating it before you've even had a chance to formulate it to yourself, say nothing about asking for it.

The rooms are still being served impeccably and efficiently though the turn-down service may now happen any time between 6.30 and 9.00pm (previously, the ""window"" used to be much tighter). The breakfast is still outstanding with the minimal waiting time and wonderful selection of hot and cold options (I am especially pleased to say that having cold smoked marlin there on the plate is a master-stroke on their part) as well as fruit. The drivers (should you wish to book a sightseeing trip from the hotel, for example) are still operating in such a way that your senses are fooled for the day: surely, he is my personal chauffeur rather than a hotel driver, isn't he?

The shoes that the new management have to fill are very big, they are the wellingtons of the giants. Inertia will still be there for some months but not for much longer. As much as the paying guests, and especially the regulars, deserve the very best, the staff who has been trained to these exceptional standards of service deserve to be managed accordingly and adequately well. ""Will you be coming back yet again, sir? Are the standards still sufficiently high?"" - that is not the question that one is being asked by the hotel staff often. When several (four or five) members of staff who remember me well had asked me that, I was both pleased and concerned. I was pleased as it was a very clear indication of good training, deep understanding of what luxury brand is, and business-like attitude to what they were doing. Clearly, they have been trained to think in dollars and such terms as revenue and cost. This doesn't happen often at all. I was concerned at the same time as these questions indicated that the staff were worried. And this is not good. Neither they nor the paying guests deserve that.

I wish them all the very best of luck and I look forward to experience their oustanding service and genuine hospitality again. Before I commit myself to another visit, I shall be monitoring the situation and reading the reviews first though.

Solid 11 out 10 so far (The Legian is in a specific category, exceeding any other place I've ever been to, including all of the LHW properties; hence it is 11 rather than 10 out of 10). I hope it stays this way.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1015,Sublime,50,September 2015,"Recently travelled to Bali for the first time and was advised to go to Seminyak rather than Kuta or others as it is a beautiful beach, with tons of great eateries, shops and bars in the streets nearby and not too many pushy vendors.

We loved Seminyak and especially loved our stay at The Legian.

Top notch service, food, and facilities.

Attention to detail at every touch point

Looked to us like the pick of the beach front accommodation options.

We will be back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1016,Yes!!,50,October 2015,"No complaints! Great resort right on the beach. Impeccable service. Breathtaking sunsets. Good breakfast buffet, many restaurants within walking distance. The majority of the mini bar was free for non-alcoholic items, which provided perfect mixers!! Nice gym.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1017,Club at the Legian,50,September 2015,"This was our second time in a GHM hotel and it did not disappoint. We stayed in the Club, which is just over the road from the hotel. Despite not being beach front, it is very quiet and private. The staff are attentive and nothing is too much trouble. There is transport to anywhere in Seminyak, and they can supply a driver for a very reasonable fee to go anywhere further afield.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1018,Luxury at its very best,50,August 2015,"We had a delightful stay at The Club at the Legian and found the hospitality and service to be faultless. W were allocated our own Butler, Ary, and had our own private villa, which was well equipped and had its own private pool and garden : luxury. We had several meals at The Club where we enjoyed faultless cuisine and very attentive service.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1019,"Relaxing, gorgeous, perfection!",50,September 2015,"This hotel is worth every penny! We chose the hotel based on the numerous amazing reviews we looked at and to be honest, the pictures and reviews do not do it justice. As soon as you are welcomed into the hotel, you are made to relax with a delicious welcome drink and cool towel as they take care of your check-in for you.

The rooms are spectacular - we were in a one bedroom deluxe suite. Spacious, beautifully decorated in traditional Balinese designs, beautiful 4 poster bed and HUGE bathroom. The patio...unbelievable, huge out door bed.

The pool is gorgeous, with the service staff waiting on you hand and foot, not to mention the delicious cocktails served. Be aware that the cocktails are a little pricey, but, worth it!

Every night the hotel is decorated with candles everywhere! So beautiful and romantic, even, the balcony gets a candle.

Turn down service - they always leave a different treat every night for you, which is a lovely touch!

The location in Seminyak is perfect, very central, you are within a 5 minute walk to all the awesome, eclectic restaurants and bars! And when in doubt the concierge at the hotel is amazing, the head concierge, she was fantastic and so helpful.

Can't say enough about how amazing our experience was here! Highly Recommend!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1020,A great blend of traditional and world class,50,September 2015,"This hotel deserves its high ratings - the management do an excellent job of bringing world-class hotel service to a property that has a wonderful traditional ""local"" feel to it. The property is kept in immaculate condition with beautiful gardens, water features (with an amazing koi collection), 3 swimming pools and access to the beach. The gym and spa are excellent - don't miss out on the spa!

This is an ""all-suite"" hotel - the rooms are really well designed and appointed and don't have a claustrophobic ""hotel feel"" to them. Breakfast is served in the Restaurant (see separate review), where you are treated to a splendid buffet with the finest local fruit, international pastries, breads, cheeses, freshly squeezed juices and smoothies and numerous other treats. On top of this you are able to order from the breakfast menu - eggs of your choice with a wide range of accompaniments.

Pool side and adjacent to the beach are 2 all day open air restaurants - the menu is simple but perfect for lunch. Afternoon tea was free of charge during our stay:)

Across the street the hotel has a hidden enclave called the Legian Club...be sure to have dinner there on at least one occasion - fine Balinese cuisine with delightful service.

Last, but not least...the service is truly world class. Staff addressed us by name and went out of their way to make our stay very enjoyable.

We look forward to our next visit!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1021,Hilarious - best hotel ever!! Even after being there more than 10 times!!!!,50,September 2015,"Best service!! Great people and a amazing surrounding! If you like to have a perfect holiday...you have to come over!!
Food is extraordinary! Pool... Is outstanding! You have to visit the spa... All treatments are great ... You will feel energized , younger and ... Just have to try it!! The staff is the best !!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1022,Service with a smile,40,October 2014,"The legian is certainly a romantic luxury private hotel in the heart of seminyak. the room we booked faced the beach and we were able to enjoy the sunrise and sunsets each day. not sure if it was the time or season of our visit but there were not many people staying at the hotel at that time, it seemed like we were the only ones around and i say that in a good way. i.e. we had alot of privacy and we were treated very well with excellent service for the entire stay. the rooms were spacious and well kept. the bathroom was a bit dated though still very nice and clean. each room had a private balcony overlooking the pool and i especially enjoyed the afternoon tea which they brought to the room each day.
the infinity pool was super relaxing and we also tried the massage in the hotel which was really good. breakfast options were rather limited and not like a huge spread you would find at the St regis bali or something, but still served the purpose. it was a couples hotel as you hardly found any kids running around.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1023,Honeymoon,50,August 2015,Wonderful Staff and resort. Highly recommend for a relaxing vacation. Worth every penny. The views and sunsets are remarkable and the staff very friendly and helpful. Gave great restaurant recommendations which helped us navigate where to go easier during our stay.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1024,Perfect Vacation,50,August 2015,"We had our summer vacation at Legian. We stayed at the club villas and enjoyed our time very much. From the moment we checked in, the staff were very helpful, polite and smiling all the time. I'd like to thank especially to chef Luke and all kitchen team for the fabulous food.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1025,Outstanding in every aspect,50,September 2015,"From the moment we checked in our expectations were far exceeded. All staff were very helpful, polite and accommodating to our every request. The hotel was always in a pristine condition and the service was impeccable. Highlight of our stay was the 'Intimate BBQ for 2' and relaxing by the infinity pool on the lawns with the beach less than 20m away.

Special mention to Debbie who was our private waitress for the 'Intimate BBQ for 2', she was wonderful and extremely friendly and made our dining experience special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1026,Bliss,50,September 2015,"We've travelled to many places and had some wonderful experiences. Honestly, this hotel through its design, its people and its ethos tops them all. Literally everything is taken care of. In terms of the setting, the view of the sunset is perfect and the cocktails are a great accompaniment. It's an absolutely outstanding establishment and one of the few places I've visited where I'm literally planning my return as soon as possible.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1027,Perfect Beach Retreat,50,August 2015,"There is nothing more soothing to my soul than to breath sea air and fall asleep hearing the sound of waves crashing on the shore. And the best place I know of to do this is a suite at The Legian.

As a frequent visitor to Bali over the last 8 years, I have watched the boisterous crowds of surfers and wannabe surfers, and the shops that supply them, overflow Kuta beach and environs to flood the streets of formerly quiet, peaceful Seminyak and Legian with the same noise. Fortunately, although located within easy walking distance of ""Eat Street,"" The Legian remains apart and exclusive.

In my opinion, a great hotel (or restaurant) is one that can consistently deliver the same product over time. One where the service is ubiquitous and prescient without being overbearing, and the attention to details heightens the guests pleasure.

The Legian delivers a quiet, almost reclusive, beach front experience that is five star quality, and it has done so every time I have stayed there since 2011. This means very clean, simple, understated rooms with elegant accouterments that allow me to maximize my beach experience, such as: a mosquito-net draped master king size bed for a peaceful night's sleep; a day bed and bathing suit drying rack on the balcony. Room service that is identical to dining in The Restaurant at The Legian (see separate Trip Advisor review entitled, ""Resort Friendliness, Five Star Service"") right down to the pink calla lily table decoration. This level of service even extends to the beachfront lounge area, where guests are automatically provided a tray with glasses of iced drinking water, cold hand towels adorned with a fragrant frangipani flower.

My recommendations are:

My favorite place to watch and photograph the amazing sunsets in Bali is from one of the beachfront day beds that The Legian has overhanging the beach.

If you're there over a Friday night try The Legian Seafood Indulgence buffet instead of making the hour-long trek to Jimbaran Beach to get ripped off by the seafood hawkers there. The Legian seafood buffet is all you can eat, including appetizers, mains and desserts for Rp675,000. (<US $50/per) which is a real bargain compared to the Jimbaran beach restaurant we visited during this trip, which was offering a complete, set meal for Rp800,000 that offers only tiny 100gram ( 4 ounce) tasting portions, or the a la carte menu where they weigh the seafood and charge you ""market"" price based on weight (choose this one if you're interested in stimulating the local economy;).

If you love to breath sea air and to fall asleep hearing the sound of waves crashing on the shore stay in one of the suites in the main hotel, not one of the villas. The villas offer the same level of service with even more privacy (good for honeymooners) but they are located behind the main hotel so there is no sea view, sound, etc.

Enjoy!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1028,Perfect score,50,August 2015,"We stayed for four nights in a three-bedroom villa in The Club. The six of us arrived feeling pretty jet-lagged and at first were not convinced by being the other side of the road from the main hotel and the ocean. However, we quickly realised the villa was stunning and we had the 25 metre pool at The Club pretty much to ourselves.

Over the next four days the service was fantastic, the food great and the waves on the beach just right for working up an appetite.

The only tiny niggle we could find was the lack of reading lights by the bed in the master bedroom. That was the only fault. Everything else was perfect, even when you apply Aman standards.

When we left for Ubud, the hotel rang me the next day. I thought it would be about something they had forgotten to charge us for - difficult when the mini bar and laundry were both included in the villa rate. But no, they were calling to say they had found our son had left his new Oakley sunglasses in the hotel car and they were going to get them delivered to our hotel in Ubud later that day.

I spent quite a bit of time hesitating about which hotel to stay at on the coast in Bali. Save time and go to The Legian. You won't regret it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1029,Crying because we had to go home. . .,50,September 2015,"My husband and I just spent 2.5 weeks in Bali, most of our time at a hotel in the Ubud area but after our hotel in the south (long story) wasn't right, we made a last minute decision to spend the final four nights of our vacation at this spectacular hotel. While expensive, it was absolutely the right decision. We felt relaxed and pampered and the quiet and very luxurious property was perfect for us. The service was impeccable, the room was amazing, the food was delicious, and the location on a gorgeous stretch of beach was lovely. We've never so thoroughly relaxed - aside from a daily walk on the beach we didn't leave the grounds for four days (we had seen a lot of Bali during the first part of our trip). We are on our way home, tears trickling down our cheeks, this is a great place to stay and highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1030,Great Hotel Great Location,50,August 2015,"Very good hotel in Bali, if you want to stay in the touristic part of Bali this is the place for you, near the KudeTa and Potato head on the beach but builed aa an old fashion hotel with rooms facing the beach but not on the beach. great for families, very good service.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1031,The most hospitable leading hotel of the world,50,September 2015,"My husband and I spent a couple of nights a week ago to celebrate our wedding anniversary in this stunning property. The hotel has marked the occasion so special with a bottle of vintage champagne, chocolate cake and a beautiful bunch of exotic flowers. The service here at the beach, in the room or at the restaurant is second to none. Citrawan, waiting at the breakfast table was very attentive who went through our dietary requests in great details to make sure we have the food we enjoy. The hotel is well worth of its 'leading hotel of the world' status.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1032,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Setting, Wonderful Spa",50,September 2015,"This was the final of our three three hotels in Bali, at first glance this is a very stylish hotel, the main foyer is spacious, open and well decorated. The room itself (we went for the deluxe 1 bedroom apartment) was also excellent (albeit we had some issues with a slightly damp smell, but this was rectified by the hotel staff) The staff here are especially helpful with making reservations for restaurants, booking cars and tending to your every need.

The breakfast was certainly the highlight here. This was by far the best breakfast we ate in Bali. The eggs and accompaniments were a la carte and to compliment this there was also a huge buffet selection that was well made. The setting for breakfast was also fabulous, directly facing the Ocean front. Couldn't think of a better way to start the day.

Finally I have to add that there was a very large number of items free from the mini-bar! these range from peanuts and biscuits to cans of soft drink. This is very rare in any hotel, even other ultra luxury 5 star resorts. We were also given complimentary afternoon tea on the beach everyday. Again a great touch from the hotel,

Many thanks (especially to shift manager Ledi) who made out stay magnificent!)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1033,Highest Standard Achievable,50,August 2015,"This is a first rank accomodation: you know what you expect to get and The Legian Bali simply match your expectation at the most.

Top Class Hotel, perfect service, gym and pools are a plus given my need to train.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1034,Room with view,50,August 2015,"We come since years to this place with view and to this wounderful
people.
We had the seafood buffet at the seafront, the food and service was perfect.
Thank you for taking care of us and hope to see you soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1035,luxurious hotel with most beautiful ocean front view,50,August 2015,"I visited this hotel with my boyfriend. He has stayed here before and hence wanted to book it again because he said it's the only hotel in Bali whereby the location is so strategic. you can sleep with the soothing sound of the ocean waves at night. And I was amazed when I reached the hotel. Firstly, the airport transfer was really comfortable. We were picked up by a friendly professional on time driver from the legian and the vehicle used was this huge SUV with long and wide leg space for the half hour ride through the crowded seminyak street and sunset road. we were greeted by a well groomed receptionist who attended to us immediately and briefed us in details of our stay and offered us a welcome drink and a tour around the hotel facilities. We gladly accept it. We were upgrade from one bedroom to two bedroom suite and we were facing right on where the waves breaks and the sound of ocean waves greeted us every day and night. it's quite therapeutic and when we opened the balcony door, its a nice blue sky, Palm trees and the full view of the Indian ocean. The suite is huge. There's two bedroom with two bathroom, a big tub with bath salt and candle, a living room with a widescreen tv and DVD player and a dining room and a spacious balcony with a wide sofa and a table with chairs for drinking juices while looking out at the ocean. Every evening, they will do touch down before sleep time and gave a little dessert on our dining table. I find it a lovely and thoughtful touch. The minibar has complimentary soda and hives and hard of cookies and crackers and drinking water in bottled provided and top up more than once a day. the housekeeping is top notch and the bed has mosquitoe net and the housekeeper even sprayed mosquitos repellent for you and put a smoking pot outside yr door so that you won't be attacked by mosquitoes at night. The room service was always polite and they arrange yr meal in full fine dining setting. And it's delicious! The air con can be adjusted to really cold if you are someone who afraid of the heat and we borrowed complimentary dvd to watch every night in the confort of the living room after our dinner in the dining room. The best thing I like is the constant gentle ocean waves in the background which relaxed us before sleep time. Our belongings are always safe. I even put some money on table for tips for the housekeeper but they didn't take it because I didn't indicate clearly so it's a very honest hotel. I recommend this hotel for couoples especially because they have a clean modern gymsuites and spa, beautiful suites and view, nice candle light dinner and a strategic location on legian beach. It's one hotel I'm truly impressed with. Not to mention it's right on the beach so we spent every evening sitting on the oceanfront lounge to watch sunset sometimes walking along the beach while watching the sun goes down. What more can I ask?",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1036,Sophisticated Beauty,50,April 2015,"Super stay at the Club Villas. Privately gated compound with well appointed stylish interiors and own pool. First class service at all times. Travelling after the Easter holidays the main hotel was quiet so we spent time at the main pools with their stunning ocean views but equally the private club pool would have provided a quieter elegant experience during peak season. We chose to eat at the main hotel due to wider food options and were amazed to find the restaurant staff and reception staff all greeted us by our names. This small personal touch really added to the experience of feeling valued and welcome. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. I have rated this as a boutique hotel due to staying at the Club , however the main hotel is not boutique.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1037,Simply stunning,50,September 2015,"I wasn't actually a guest staying at the hotel its self, however my partner and I went to the hotel restaurant on our first and last night in Bali, the staff are so friendly, fantastic service, is alittle pricy but the table we were sat at on our last night was right near the infinity pools with flames and candles lit everywhere, with the sounds of the waves crashing, was a really special dinner, if I was to ever come back to Bali I will be looking at staying here first, was so pleasant.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1038,Most perfect honeymoon!,50,August 2015,"We just arrived home after 3 days staying at the Legian Club in Seminyak. Without a doubt the most unbelievable 3 days we have ever spent. The Club exceeded are expectations. From the size and quality of the villas, to the incredible service of our Butler, Diki, and all the staff, the little touches like knowing I dont eat pork or shellfish and ensuring that any canapes or foods we ordered didnt have these ingredients. And the attention to detail was fantastic, our Butler noticed we started adding more water bottles in the fridge and then re-filled this with loads of water the following days. The Club is across the road from the main hotel and the sea, set in private grounds, however it takes a minute to get to the main hotel and you can even get a buggy. The Club was private, quiet and just what we wanted for our honeymoon. The complimentary clothes washing, afternoon tea, cocktatil hour and transport was very well recieved too. I would go back to this hotel in an instance and would recommend it without doubt.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1039,Fantastic!! Best service ever...,50,August 2015,"We spent the first 7 days of our honeymoon at The Legian and couldn't have asked for a better choice..
From the moment we arrived the service was first class. The staff were friendly,polite and couldn't do enough for us.

We had a suite with sea views which was simply breathtaking and everyone was reasonably priced considering the quality and service

When venturing out into the busy seminyak town returning to the hotel was like an oasis of calm. It's our last night before heading off to the hanging gardens of Ubud for the remainder of our stay on this fantastic island! Let's hope it's as good as The Legian!

We also hired a driver for the day to show us round the island called ""Made"" who wasnt linked to the hotel but well worth the £25 we spent on seeing the local sights of Bali!

I have put his email here for the convenience of anyone visiting here and could not recommend him highly enough.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1040,Absolute Bliss,50,August 2015,"Wow! Our stay at The Legian was pure bliss. The most beautiful place inside and out. The room we stayed on was a Studio with beach views which was to die for. We had a kitchen with a fully stocked minibar fridge as well as fresh exotic fruit basket and free juices and soft drinks. We loved the bathroom and his and her vanity! Bed and pillows were ultra comfy and the little touches of turning the covers down and leaving a frangipani and a poem on our pillow was a lovely extra.
We loved the three tiered pool that cascades down to the beach, the complimentary hi tea each afternoon and the library. The breakfast buffet was very comprehensive however I felt ""over serviced"" - I would have liked less service so I could just relax without someone next to us in case we sneezed and need something.
Overall highly recommend it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1041,Perfection,50,August 2015,We stayed at The Legian for two week at the beginning of August. It is our second stay here and we would not stay anywhere else in Seminyak. The room are spacious and have gorgeous views over the beach. The property has a good balance of traditional Balinese and modern. The staff here make the hotel. Everyone from breakfast staff to housekeeping is just so friendly and 'on the ball'. Nothing here is too much trouble for you and you really do feel like a VIP. The food is excellent- I am missing my three course breakfasts! The afternoon tea each day is a lovely touch. We can't wait for our next visit!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1042,Amazing honeymoon,50,August 2015,"We stayed at the Legian for our honeymoon for 3 nights and was amazing from start to finish. The staff were so friendly and all knew our names and that we were on honeymoon which made us feel very special. We arrived and were shown around the whole hotel and the member of staff spoke great English, we were then shown to our amazing room and a cake, bottle of champagne and other treats. The facilities and pool were good and the beach area for the hotel was well looked after and nice.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1043,"Quite simply, outstanding!",50,August 2015,"This stunning, iconic property has been at the forefront of 5 star Bali accommodation since it's opening 19 years ago, and it is well deserving of the many accolades heaped upon it. Still immaculate, and possessing, surely, the most charming and gracious staff, it is a great pleasure to spend time here. Previously we have stayed at The Oberoi, a few hundred meters away, but The Legian is a far more luxurious, and has won us over completely.

Everything, from the moment we arrived, was seamless, and splendid service was apparent in every aspect of the daily operations. I have no idea how the staff seem to know your name from day one, and, quite frankly, I don't want to - it might reduce the ""magic"". There are no weak links - Food and Beverage is outstanding, ditto Housekeeping, ditto Concierge, and ditto Pool Attendants. Our only regret was that we had spent too much time at the sister property in Ubud, but next time, we will come here, directly from the airport, without doubt.

The reservations team were especially helpful, as it took three attempts for us to get here, due to the volcanic ash causing disruptions to schedules. They took onboard my mobility restrictions, putting us in the central wing, which made access to the main facilities easier for me. A generous upgrade made a belated anniversary trip even more special, so we sincerely say, thank you.

In summary, an outstanding and very well managed property, truly deserving of it's genuine 5 star ranking.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1044,A true VIP experience,50,July 2015,"We stayed at The Legian for 5 night, it was the final part of our honeymoon. We were greeted with a cake, a bottle of champagne on ice and a floral bath.
Throughout our stay the service was exceptional, the food delcious and the facilities - first class.
It was all about the attention to detail: the cakes sent to the room every evening, the pool service, the afternoon tea, the fact that staff knew our names etc.
A true VIP experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1045,Wonderful Stay,50,November 2014,"Wonderful stay at The Legian, we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite, with beautiful ocean view, and all the amenities one could want. Staff was exceptional, concierge helped us with planning side trips. Loved the extra pool side treats. And the yoga classes on the grass were perfect start to the day",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1046,"Beautiful seafront location, service like no other",50,July 2015,"We stayed at the Legian for 5 nights at the end of our wonderful honeymoon. As soon as we arrive we were greeted by the hotel manager and given a welcome drink and cold towels and then a tour of the hotel. Our room wasn't ready but that wasn't a problem as we were given a cabana to lounge around and taking in the wonderful beach view. We ordered some champagne and relaxed.

We were shown to our room a short time later and there was a bottle of Louis Roederer champagne on ice ready for our consumption alongside a handwritten welcome note AND a honeymoon cake. The room as amazing, huge bathroom with very fancy products, sun loungers with table and chairs on the balcony. The sitting area had a big sofa for you to watch TV on. Fresh fruit everyday. They also supplied a mini bar with free soft drinks and juices, mineral water and snacks. Afternoon tea is between 4-6pm daily (delicious). Every night they leave you a poem and a small dessert as part of the turn down service, they even turn the TV round to face the bed and pop the remotes next to your bed for you. Nothing is too much at this hotel. If you needed anything the staff would do everything to get it for you.

Breakfast was the best. The buffet had everything - cold meats, cereal, juices, yoghurts, nasi goreng, pastries etc etc. You can also order hot breakfasts - eggs benedict, french toast!! you can eat as much as you want. We also had a seafood dinner right on the beach one night which was beautiful. Very fresh seafood, great service.

The gym facilities were excellent, great equipment and the daily yoga classes in the garden was brilliant.

We had the best stay at the Legian and the service from the staff was truly amazing. Everyone knows your name. If they even see you trying to adjust your umbrella or sun lounger they literally come running over to help. You literally do not need to lift a finger here. The location is amazing, right on the beachfront, close to other fab restaurants like La Lucciola and busy bars, but it is a very peaceful and relaxing hotel.

We definitely left Bali on a high and we look forward to coming back for our 1 yr anniversary.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1047,mrs l thomas,50,August 2015,"We arrived at The Legian Hotel on Monday the2nd of August- very tired after flying in from the U.K.
We were offered a tour of the hotel that point, but declined and were shown straight to our room...., WOW
everylittle detail had been attended to. Pure luxury fromthe Acqua DI Parma toiletries to the wine and fruit.
breakfast the following morning- we were greeted with ' hello Mr and Mrs Thomas!!!' in our 1st morning?! we really felt like VIP's at The Legian. The food was out of this world, every morning we had a 3 course breakfast!!! everyone was so friendly- we will be sorry to mive to our next destination in Ubud The Viceroy. The Legain have set a very high standard..... we will be back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1048,A little piece of Heaven on Earth!!,50,July 2015,"We stayed at The Legian for 6 nights from July 23rd with very good friends of ours!! What an amazing experience! The location and facilities are outstanding, but it is the quality of the service that makes it so special!! All the staff we met were so polite, friendly and helpful!! Nothing was too much trouble! The breakfast is a feast to behold! We had dinner at the hotel restaurant on our last night and it was one of the finest meals we've ever had!! We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe suite which had all you could ask for! To wake in the morning and walk out on to the verandah, and be greeted with the most stunning view of the Southern Indian Ocean, Is something that will live with us forever!! To sit on a lounger, sipping a Banana Daiquiri, watching the stunning sunset, is surely the stuff dreams are made of? We would love to visit again in the future!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1049,The Club @ The Legian - Heaven on Earth,50,July 2015,"We stayed in Villa 9 at The Club @ The Legian for the 2nd part of our honeymoon in Bali and this was our little piece of heaven on earth. From the moment we checked in until the minute we were waved off at the end of our stay we were made to feel like royalty. Agus, our butler, was truly fantastic. Nothing was ever too much trouble and he made our stay very special, so thank you again Agus, it was a pleasure to have met you. All the staff at both The Club and the Legian hotel are extremely good at their jobs and make you feel very welcome and valued. The food and drinks were of a good standard and fairly priced for a top end establishment. The views out over the ocean from the infinity pools at the hotel are stunning.

Our villa was fantastic, offering complete luxury in tranquil private surroundings, with our butler just a phone call away we truly were in heaven. I have never stayed anywhere that can compete with this in my mind, and I have been fortunate enough to stay in some pretty good hotels around the world. The Legian thoroughly deserves it's place in the Leading Hotels of the World and I would highly highly recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in this area of Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1050,We'll be back...,50,August 2015,"We are pampered (not to say pampered) guests. We have high expectations of a hotel which belongs to The Leading Hotels of the World. But for us, The Legian is already A Legend.

It's great that the pool villa is equipped with a flat screen, Bose iPad docks and a Nestle coffee machine. It was special that the WiFi was super-fast. But what really makes the difference here is the ultimate in customer service and friendliness of the staff. Nothing is too much, every request is performed with a smile. This is truly a world-class service.

Excellent gym with water (and coconut water!). Delicious breakfast buffet.

We come back! Thanks to Chandra!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1051,Super Stay,50,July 2015,"Our stay was a bit slow out of the gates actually, but it quickly warmed up to the standard expected. The rooms, pools, atmosphere, location are brilliant. The location is unique amongst Asian islands, in that its rare to have such a fantastic hotel within walking distance to so many excellent restaurants and a wide variety of shopping. We travelled with our 5 year old and she loved The Legian. The hotel seems to have the balance just right between adults and kids. During high season, kids activities are available under the palm trees - a most beautiful location for the little ones to have some fun. A brilliant stay, we will be back for sure.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1052,Perfect!,50,July 2015,"We stayed here for two nights on our last days of our summer trip in Japan and Indonesia. An excellently run GHM hotel on a beautiful strip on Seminyak beach. Fantastic estate and service. Brilliant breakfast. Nice pool facilities.

Expensive but worth it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1053,Simply amazing!,50,July 2015,"Highly recommend this hotel. The attention to detail is something else. All the staff were friendly and incredibly helpful. The food was delicious and the rooms were stunning.
The only bad thing was having to leave and come home!!
Can't wait to plan out next trip back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1054,Perfect service and highly recommended,50,June 2015,"This really is a fantastic hotel all round and you will not be disappointed. Go for the incredible service (really couldn't fault it), the stunning beach location and quieter part of town. The rooms are a timeless style with everything in the right place. It's brilliant having a little kitchenette with the complimentary minibar, it's also the little touches like the sweets at turn down and the afternoon tea included. The staff will make your stay feel extra special. It's well worth every penny.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1055,Wow!!,50,July 2015,"Thank You Mt Ruang, for providing the conditions that enabled us to experience the beautiful 3- bedroom villa @ ""The Club"" Legian.
This villa was amazing! Beautiful, large rooms, private pool with several day beds and loungers, complimentary everything and the wonderfully attentive Wayan, our butler for our short ""overstay"". There is nowhere else I would stay, if going back to the Kuta/Legian beach/Seminyak area, but The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1056,"This is an amazing place- peaceful, spectacular sunsets and very friendly staff. Beware on line private villas",50,August 2014,"First of all we traveled here in 2008 but we have recommended to friends who have been recently and loved it. This was one of the highlights of our Honeymoon we were on 2nd floor room that was beautifully appointed. There was a big magnificent day bed on the balcony overlooking the grounds and the ocean beyond. The staff are very friendly and eager to make you comfortable. The pool is serene and better to swim in than the ocean which in that part of Seminyak I found to be pretty dirty at times with a fair bit of rubbish in the water. The place is very quiet and serene. The food is very good and if you want a change there is a magnificent Italian restaurant called La Lucciola just a short stroll up the beach. This was an unexpected stay as we had booked into a private villa in Seminyak (booked directly online) which was stunning and had private plunge pool etc etc but it also had what sounded like a few hundred chickens and roosters next door - the noise was unbelievable and started around 4am every morning and didn't let up until sun down - needless to say we got out as soon as possible and luckily got into The Legian. We went back to Bali in 2013 and tried The Umalas we got a villa again but only after I had spoken to the Australian agent (that was part of a group of Villa owners with online offers) I mentioned our previous experience of noise at the other private villa and he assured us it was quiet so we booked when we got there it was beautiful had staff to assist with everything, security guard 24 hours, pool etc etc but again the roosters and chickens at night not as many as previous experience but 2 or 3 are enough to disturb you early in the morning. As the Umulas are in a farming area there are dogs so at night we were frequently woken by what sounded like vicious dog fights intermittently throughout the night. We were glad when we checked out and went to the second part of our holidays in Nusa Dua and loved the Novotel which like the Legian was so much quieter and relaxing than our experience with private villas in Bali. If you want a villa the Legian has a 3 bedroom beach house within the grounds so will be blissfully quiet",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1057,Out of this world,50,July 2015,"yet again an excellent stay at the legian. repeated visitor, tried and checked a few other places in between but have to say that the legian still tops it. Excellent rooms, amazingly personalized service, focus on details and exceptionally clean .. I can only recommend this hotel .. if you are willing to spend the rate per night than you shouldn't think twice. perfect location and worth every $ spent",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1058,A Balanese paradise,50,July 2015,"The Hotel offers first class service and location in Seminyak. The hotel had the traditional Balinese look and feel and not the concrete pre fab look that some of the surrounding Hotels offered. The property is older and gives a wonderful feeling of warmth and originality. The rooms and property are in great condition and a credit to the staff and management. The gardens are immaculate and well maintained to give a luxury feel. If your looking for the Bali experience over a Gold Coast look this is the one for you. The welcome from the reception set the tone for a great stay. The staff were warm and friendly and we received attentive service that made us feel special and nothing was too much effort. They managed to call us by our names each day making us feel that bit more special. The room was large and comfortable. It was well appointed and we had a wonderful view across the pool to the beach. It offered a great scene to watch the sun setting each day. Room was on second level and we had a great view. The third floor would have been probably better, but no complaints from us. Ground floor gives a garden view and access from the unit to the grounds.
We dined in the restaurant to celebrate a special occasion and received special treatment to add to the enjoyment of the occasion. This was topped off by management leaving a special treat in our room for when we returned after dinner, Champagne and sweets. The staff were aware of our occasion and we were congratulated throughout the day by staff in different parts of the resort.
We indulged with the Spa and found it very relaxing and well worth the visit. For a hotel spa it represents excellent value.
Breakfast was a special treat with great off the menu selections and buffet style. The hot buffet changed daily to allow a real Indonesian breakfast experience.
The view from the pool to the beach and ocean was a treat and you really got the relaxed buzz. Service from staff around the pool was first class, you never ran dry of flavoured water and ice, and a quick meal was very tasty.
The afternoon tea each day was a great surprise and offered a relaxed wind down before an afternoon cocktail.
The ocean noise was a bit confronting at first and you can hear it from your room. After the first night it just became a great background sound that lulled us to sleep. We did the complementary yoga in the Hotel gardens and found it a great experience.
The location was central to Seminyak and allowed us easy walking to great restaurants and shopping. Just make sure to take the shortcut to Seminyak Square.
We look forward to returning to the Legian Bali on our next Bali visit and would highly recommend it to others. You will not be disappointed.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1059,Impeccable Attention to Detail,50,July 2015,"My wife and I recently visited the Legian for 10 nights for our honeymoon. It is safe to say the hotel has earned its place on the official list of Leading Hotels of the World. The phrase I would use to sum it up was that... everything just happened. Arrive by the beach at the sun loungers and immediately you will be attended to. 2 towels each, iced water refilled constantly, facial mist to keep cool. Towels and water replaced in the room as soon as needed. Staff always on the lookout to help. It all just happened without us having to ask. Amazing experience!!

The first thing that struck us was the quality and attention to detail, literally from when we stepped into the car for our private transfer. The car was immaculate (as was the rest of the Legian's fleet of vehicles). The hotel itself didn't disappoint either. The lobby is very spacious and very welcoming. We were greeted with an ice cold glass of Lemongrass and Ginger drink, and were given a brief tour and overview of the public spaces as well as a detailed tour of our suite.

I booked a deluxe suite and had requested a room on the top floor a while before arrival. They mentioned they could not guarantee this but that they'd try to accommodate the request, which they were able to do, and we proceeded to room 433 where a bottle of champagne was waiting on ice.

Some of our favourite things about the hotel were:

1. The staff were extremely attentive and also very friendly. We were always greeted by name. Needs were met very promptly, and we used the very knowledgeable concierge employees many times. I'm unable to remember all of the names but Heri and Verena were two of those who were a big help.

2. The hotel is maintained extremely efficiently. The grass is maintained daily so it stays nice and green. We saw gardeners etc out daily as well as the housekeeping staff all day.
Our room was also kept very clean, with housekeeping twice daily who replenished tea/coffee, candles, water and more. Can;t sing the praises of the staff enough.

3. Seminyak was a great place to stay. (For us) it had the perfect mix of shops and restaurants. We spoke to a couple who were staying in Jimbaran who mentioned they couldn't find any good restaurants. You're spoiled for choice in Seminyak, and there are many shops and a great market nearby. In the evening, there was a real buzz HOWEVER, contrary to some reviews, all we could hear from our room at night was the Indian Ocean surf on the beach outside the hotel. Do not be put off by Seminyak's reputation as a lively place. The hotel provides the perfect oasis of tranquility and we could hear nothing from our room (note we stayed in peak season in July).

4. The 3-level infinity pool was great. Perfect view of the ocean, but without the sand and salty water.

5. The breakfast was great. Mix of pastries, eggs( on toast, benedict), array of fruit and fruit juices, waffles, pancakes and more!! All cooked to order. Breakfast was always a highlight. The food in the restaurant is slightly pricier than going outside the hotel however it was also more of a fine-dining experience than anywhere else we went, and the evening view is one you cannot pay for in a normal restaurant- worth a try at the very least. The food was great.

All in all, we can't sing the praises of the hotel and its staff enough. The staff deserve a big bonus for all their hard work! If you're looking for a holiday or honeymoon where you can relax and be taken care of in a luxury setting, look no further. We hope to be back again! Can't fault them. Impeccable attention to detail.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1060,FF,50,July 2015,"My family and i stayed in the Legian for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The staff members were very welcoming, helpful and hard working. The location is great as it is in Seminyak and it is directly at the beach. The service was very nice and the hotel offered a great a spa, gym and breakfast. The food was exceptional. Overall the experience was great, there seems to be great management. I can only recommend this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1061,The Club at The Legian,50,July 2015,"Recently had 3 nights at The Club within The Legian for our 20th wedding anniversary. Coming out of the airport we were greeted by the representative and guided to the waiting luxury car and friendly driver. His driving was safe and excellent. 30 minutes to the hotel. Located in the best area of Seminyak. Warm welcome from staff and shown straight to our villa by our personal butler. The gates opened to our private oasis and it was gasp worthy. Dramatic lighting in the pool. Authentic decor of the villa. Soothing Balinese music. The next few days were a blur of luxury, peace, and relaxation. Swimming in our own private pool, also The Club's stunning main pool, and the gorgeous infinity pools at The Legian across the road, accessed by golf cart. Eating delicious food at the beautiful airy intimate Club Lounge or in our own lush garden outdoor table. Big comfortable bed. Huge bathroom. Outdoor bath. Spacious villa, possibly abit dim for some. Our butler was, as were all the staff, genuinely friendly and courteous and attentive. Only appeared to be a few other guests at The Club while we were there. It was Australian school holidays so The Legian had many families. We took our 7yo son and so we spent some time each day at The Legian where the other kids were. Loved the spectacular pools overlooking the beach and crashing waves. Cocktails under the palm trees-heavenly! Unfortunately The Legian pools were not immune from sun lounge hoggers, who place a towel and a book and come and go as they please all day. Each day I was annoyed to see all loungers by the childrens pools taken, but only a few people in the area. It was nice to retreat back to our private pool where sun lounger availability was never an issue! My husband has walking difficulties and the staff were always ready to assist if needed. Be aware there are steps throughout the resort, no handrails at steps or at the pools. Not a complaint, just an observation. Can't wait to return to this stunning resort.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1062,The hotel that has it all,50,May 2015,"This review is long overdue.....

I think we love this hotel more than the owners and managers do - it is going to be very difficult to put how we feel about this hotel into words but will give it a shot!

THE HOTEL
Collectively we have both been here about 8-10 times and it surpasses the service, location, ambience, cleanliness, room quality etc etc we have experienced elsewhere, including other GHM properties that we have stayed in.

It ticks all boxes at once.

We have stayed in hotels with better views, much more modern hotels, one's located in the world's best locations, more luxurious rooms - BUT The Legian just has something, an edge - that cannot be recreated, it just has it!

From our very first visit in November 2006 to our last in May 2015 the hotel has been consistently amazing and we know exactly what to expect each time, with additions of very small positive tweaks that the hotel makes to improve the common areas/rooms etc.

The location is perfect, slightly tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the main Seminyak strip which is nice but within 5 mins (short taxi ride) you are amongst incredible restaurants such as Trattoria, Mama San, Sarong and of course the institution Ku De Ta.

THE STAFF
Although most of the staff are familiar with us now after so many trips, they have been attentive remembering our names and preferences from day one. On this last trip they knew we liked higher rooms with clearer views of the sea and no trees obstructing, so when we arrived they had already allocated us the most perfect room and even had our preferences from previous trips noted.

THE ROOMS
We have stayed in all the categories of room, and surprisingly the studio is our favourite as they have all have a lounge area with TV and a big balcony with day bed and the bed in the main room has good sea views whilst you lay in bed. The one bedroom suites are also lovely, with larger living spaces but for some reason the feel of the studios are lovely.

THE AMENITIES
The hotel with the best amenities so far as I am a huge fan of Aqua di Parma! Each room comes with a beach bag, iPod to use on the beach and slippers which you can also use in the pool area / on the beach. The sound system is great with all the relevant cables to plug your iPod / phone into. The kitchen is stocked daily with soft drinks and fresh cookies/snacks that are complimentary also.

THE BREAKFAST
The restaurant location is beautiful, overlooking the pool area with the sea in the distance - its the perfect breakfast setting. They have recently introduced a few more hot breakfast dishes and the fresh fruit selection and patisseries are incredible. We have eaten dinner in the main restaurant but prefer to opt for Seminyak as there are so many fantastic restaurants to experience outside of the hotel also, but if you don't want to leave the hotel (and we are with you on that one) then you won't bore of the food in the main restaurant. We are vegetarian, eating no fish also, and they have always accommodated by making special dishes for us.

THE POOL AREA
A few years ago The Legian added an additional infinity pool and it was the best decision they ever made. The deep pool (adults only) enable long pool dipped sunset views of the ocean

Afternoon tea is offered complimentary to guests, and if you are by the pool you are asked personally if you would like afternoon tea brought to you. The afternoon tea on my last trip seems to have improved with a wider selection of yummy desserts along with tea/coffee.

There are two completely covered day beds either side of the pool, which is great for families or if you want to avoid being completely in the sun.

We always spend a few hours in the sea body boarding, the boards are available to use from the hotel and you can ask someone to show you how to use them if needed!

CONS
There aren't any other than on my last trip in May there seemed to be a lot more children (loud screaming children) than usual, which may have been due to the Easter break. There was one particular pair of screaming kids who ran riot, jumping in all the pools, loud tantrums etc - this was quite distracting, and took away from the idyllic peaceful setting, but understandably totally out of the hotel's control and I think the parents just wanted to have a nice holiday so ignore them (not great for the rest of us). This was the first time however we have been distracted by lots of children screaming and playing from 9am in the pool until sunset as although The Legian is family friendly, generally there are more couples and quieter children.

We will definitely be back - our next trip to the far east is planned for next November so we will send an updated review then!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1063,Above and beyond,50,June 2015,"My partner and I just returned from 4 nights at the Club and thoroughly enjoyed our stay from start to finish. The highlights were, above all, the personalized service and delicious food. Chandra was our butler and ensured every detail was just perfect. Suta was an incredible server in the restaurant who tailored each meal to our tastes and spent time teaching us a bit about Balinese cuisine. I'd highly recommend the chicken curry in the Club's restaurant.

We found the spa to be a very tranquil retreat that operated seamlessly. Front desk service was very friendly and the massage from Mastra was excellent.

We were saddened to say goodbye to the Legian but will most certainly be back to enjoy the property and beach. Thanks again to the amazing staff.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1064,Relaxing and luxurious honeymoon,50,July 2015,"Our honeymoon, part 2, got off to a great start when we arrived here to a lovely welcome where everything was taken care of for us while we were seated and offered refreshments as part of the check-in process. Our bags were already waiting for us when we were shown to our one bedroom deluxe suite on the top floor, which was just simply gorgeous. Everything about the suite was comfortable and well thought out. The balcony was enormous and a great place to watch the famous local sundown over complimentary afternoon tea. The evening turn-down service made the suite very cosy for the night. Really, truthfully, We're unable to fault the hotel. The staff are lovely and we ended up feeling very much looked after. Breakfast was always a great start to the day, and we also enjoyed dinner in the restaurant and drinks from the poolside bars. They have a great range of refreshing non-alcoholic drinks. We very highly recommend this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1065,Fantastic in every way,50,June 2015,"The Legion is easily one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The staff were exceptional, location is great - right on the beach. Food and pool are also top rate. Very hard to fault this hotel.

I would definitely stay here if returning to Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1066,super relaxation,50,July 2015,"The Legian is wonderful for relaxing, the pools and the service at the pools where AWESOME!!!!

me and my family had such a great time there and hopefully we can come again to the lovely Legian!!!

they have no mosquito problems at least not for the winter time!
the food was awesome and the drinks were too!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1067,A wonderful experience...,50,July 2015,"There are certain hotels which deliver on all fronts and The Legian is up there. The service is second to none, the rooms are spacious with sea views, the pool is great, the food is fantastic. I am struggling to find anything wrong with this place as it just forces you to enjoy yourself. Its not cheap but if you want quality with a view to die for then its worth every penny. The only minor downside is that the hotel seems to not frown upon patrons getting up early in the morning and securing sun bed spaces which I wouldn't expect in a property like this. Its not like Benidorm honest! Give them 20 mins, if no one there then no bed reserved, simple and effective!

I would stay here every trip if coming to Bali that often.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1068,A trip to Paradise!,50,April 2015,"We have just returned from a fantastic stay at The Legian. The service from when you arrive to when you leave is faultless. The hotel itself is beautiful and well located - right on the beach!. The staff are amazing , so helpful and friendly . The rooms are immaculate with lots of nice little touches such as fresh fruit and chocolates. No review will not do this hotel justice - you have to go as its amazing!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1069,I could not imagine how to improve this hotel,50,June 2015,"3 words to describe this...perfect perfect perfect! We arrived late 2am from Darwin and had hotel pick us up at the airport. The driver was able to negotiate around a very long traffic jam, and when we arrived they were waiting on us, with drinks and a relaxing reception. We had a beautiful suite that faced the ocean. The Balinese style of the room, was so peaceful and beautiful. On the balcony there was a large sofa that you never wanted to leave! The bed was very comfortable with crisp sheets. Double sinks in an ultra modern bathroom with a separate tub/shower including bath salts and candles.
They delivered fresh fruit every day, Nespresso coffee and snacks and non-alcoholic drinks were included. We had breakfast there every day, the buffet included Indonesian dishes as well as Western dishes you could order. All overlooking the ocean. We had dinner there and it was fantastic. If you stay, be sure to have dinner at the hotel one night for an elegant experience.

There were 3 Iniitiy pools with the double bed loungers, and included Afternoon Tean from 4-6. There was complimentary yoga done outside facing the ocean. This was everything I could have hoped for in a vacation. All of the staff knew our names and were gracious to all of our needs and wants.

The way the hotel was designed, with water features, and green spaces was really beautiful and felt like Bali. Thank you Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1070,Wow this hotel is amazing! Perfect end to our honeymoon,50,July 2015,"A little bit about us, we are a couple in our 30s on our honeymoon and have been traveling around the East, North then lastly the South of Bali. We have been on a private tour with a local guide and a driver for the last 8 days which was organised back home through Trailfinders.

As soon as we arrived at the legion we were very impressed the staff were very welcoming and professional. They upgraded us to a deluxe suite and made to feel very special. Our suite was amazing!!! They even had a chilled bottle of champagne and a happy honeymoon cake waiting for us. The attention to detail was great and service was exemplary. We will certainly be coming back!!

I had seen on the reviews that a lot of people had complained about the breakfast and lack of choice?? The breakfast was amazing and there was lots to choose from. As well as the buffet you could order from the menu which meant certain things were freshly cooked to order.

We had dinner at the hotel on the first night which again was amazing!

The location is great, bars restaurants shops etc are all walkable.

BEWARE we got some money changed not far from the hotel and they have a trick of slowly counting it a million time and they then nick a third of it when you're not looking! We were confused to where our money had gone and went back the following day to change more and saw the cheat us! I threatened to call the police and they suddenly apologised and gave us back the money they had stolen the day before!!

It's going to be hard staying at other hotels now as The Legian is in a league of its own.

We had a lovely experience thank you x",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1071,25th wedding anniversary,50,June 2015,"Our anniversary could not have been any where else
The legian bali has spoilt all other hotels for us
Location , weather, facilities in and around the hotel were brilliant
The best thing about the hotel
The wonderful People who work there
I'd go back in a heartbeat",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1072,awesome experience!,50,June 2015,"it was a great decision we finally decided to stay in this beautiful hotel after choosing hotels nearby, the service is excellent, we booked a seaview room and the view is just awesome, the room is biggg, it has balcony and your own sunbed and second toilet outside the room, good for a guest if you invite some. We spent our days just to enjoy this property, had breakfast-lunch-and dinner here, all worth your money! and dont get shocked if you find out that they never forget your name! just need more training to the guy in the pool with yellow shirt and radio in his ear, he has no smile, and not a service person. too bad.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1073,Incredible Hotel,50,June 2015,"My wife and I have been fortunate to stay in some great hotels round the world and the Legian is up there with the best of them. The staff and mangement were absolutely fantastic and nothing was too much trouble from the moment we were met at the airport, throughout our eight day stay and right up to the moment when they escorted us back to the check in for our return flight. The hotel is only a ten minute walk to the nightlife of Seminyak and a welcome haven afterwards.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1074,Always wonderful to return to,50,June 2015,"This hotel is still perfect regarding service,clean rooms,always smiliing staff and so on.No wonder that we are already on our way back spending our 15th time in our favoured one bedroom deluxe suite on top floor overlooking the ocean. My wife is looking forward to her yoga classes with Wayan Neti ,the fabulous Yoga teacher .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1075,"excellent stay in The Legian,Seminyak",40,June 2015,"Everything about this hotel is almost excellent,from the service,the rooms,the stunning sunsets,tranquility and the location.It is a place to be enjoyed,to just get away from the pressures of life and work.
My wife and i celebrated our Wedding Anniversary here and the hotel very kindly provided champagne,cake and flowers,very thoughful of them to do so,and make it so memorable for us.
I have a suggestion for them though,the breakfast spread can include more varieties from the region,current menu is quite limited and it becomes more of the same after 2/3 mornings.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1076,Perfectly Paradise,50,June 2015,"I'm not a beach resort guy. Generally. But at this beach resort you never have to get sand on you. Perfect pools overlooking the surf. You will go put your feet in but you will was your feet before returning to the property!

There are even beds to lay under the sun that actually hang over the sand but you never touch the sand to get on them.

The staff are simply amazing. Service at the poolside was fast. Water refills like waiters at your table at the restaurant.

To say we loved it was an understatement.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1077,Fabulous stay,50,June 2015,"The attention to details, service rendered by the staff was faultless. The food and beverage simply exquisite. All of this plus the hotel facilities and the lovely beach makes for the perfect family getaway!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1078,A set of exceptional service experiences,50,June 2015,"From the moment of our very late arrival to every interaction during the week the staff at The Legian went that little extra to create an incredible service for us. We loved how quickly and consistently they knew our names, preferences and interacted with the kids to create a set of exceptional experiences for us. A brilliant destination that is close to everything you would want or need but just easily allows you the chance to switch off when you want. We will definitely be returning...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1079,Outstanding service!!,50,June 2015,"Stayed at The Legian for 4 nights and it is one of the best hotels we stayed in. Located on the beach, with 3 swimming pools overlooking the sea the. Service was absolutely wonderful and we felt very spoilt. Anything we asked for was delivered to the high standard and we felt everything was possible at any time. No huge choice of breakfast but for small hotel it was acceptable, also there was gluten free choice if you request it. Staff was very helpful and remembered our surnames each time, mine is particularly difficult to pronounce. Very peaceful and quite at nights despite of being located 3 mins away from shops and restaurants. Will definitely return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1080,Beyond excellent !!!,50,June 2015,It was like a dream. We stayed there for our honeymoon. Everything was just perfect !!! I have never seen like this service before. Also the villa is very clean and tidy. I would really recommend this hotel to everyone.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1081,Recent stay in Bali,50,June 2015,"If you are going to be in Semyniak, this is a wonderful oasis of tranquility after a day of activity. The hotel is beautiful and the staff was wonderful. They, of course, knew us by name and were looking to help us at every opportunity. The room, 2-bedroom, was stunning. We travelled with our two daughters, 10 and 15, and they loved it as well. The surf was rough immediately in front of the hotel(caution flags up) but a 1-2 min walk in either direction was fine for swimming although small children would need to be watched as there were still some good size waves a bit off shore. Breakfast at the hotel was ample and had a very nice variety. Dinner at the hotel was also excellent. They have a nice fitness facility if you like to work out while travelling. They have yoga, Spa etc but I did not take advantage of that. The hotel is walking distance or short cab ride to shopping and many excellent restaurants.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1082,Great place to relax,50,May 2015,The Legian provided us with an amazing stay. The service and facilities were perfect! The staff went out of their way to provide us with our every need. Our room was amazing; very spacious and clean. We would definitely stay here again!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1083,A great hotel outside of crazy Kuta,50,June 2015,"The Legian is a real 5 star hotel in every respect. Great spacious suites, impeccable service and superbly clean. The rooms are nicely decorated and with very thoughtful touches, as great flower and small sweet treats on the table every single day. Almost everything in the minibar is complimentary as it should be in every hotel when you book a suite. The location is great if you don't wanna be in the middle of the Kuta frenetic rhythms. Many sockets in the room, great spacious and very luxuriously finished toilet areas shower as well a bathtub. The restaurant for dinners in one of the best we had in Bali the breakfast though could have more choices. We were there for 3 days and we got bored of the selection. The cleaning people do a great job as well as the persons on the reception and the concierge. The concierge sends written messages to the room for bookings, questions answered etc. It's a really great place in an otherwise destroyed Bali seafront.
Here I would like to mention that in general Kuta and all areas around Denpasar are so destroyed by the traffic. The loud motorbikes and the thousands of taxis who insist to give you a ride are all together making the experience of Bali impossible, tiring and stressful. For a temple visit 18km north of Kuta you may need 2 hours by taxi due to the traffic which, as said destroys all the nice memories that Bali might have left back in you. That's why I would definitely avoid Kuta for sure if I would ever come back to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1084,One of the best in the world,50,April 2015,"Year after year, this hotel is better and better. It is really the best in Bali and one of the best in the world.
Unique location on the best spot in Seminyak, on the beach. Beautiful gardens and building. But the best thing here is the service. You can note believe it. All the staff is smiling, ready to help and make you better than home. After a few days, you know the staff and they know you.
From early morning on the beach, for breakfast, for tea and later for dinner, you will enjoy every second. You just do not want to finish your holidays.
We spent 3 weeks at The Club, it was our 10th stay and all was better than ever. Here the service is over the top and give attention even to small details. The Villas are wonderful and your butler make your dreams true.
Just 2 thinks to consider : there are (really) a lot of families and a lot of kinds around the pool, in The Club side they open The Lounge in the evenings as a balinese restaurant, and it is not so private as it was before.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1085,Honeymoon bliss!,50,April 2015,"The Legian in Seminyak was the first (and best!) stop in Bali for our honeymoon. The infinity pool over the Indian Ocean was one of the most beautiful we've ever seen. Highly suggest taking advantage of the morning yoga classes.

My only critique would be in regard to food allergy accommodations. I was assured prior to booking our stay that the restaurants could accommodate my gluten free diet (I have celiac), I found the food staff to be very unclear as to what ""gluten"" is...I was served food with soy sauce which contains wheat, bread crumbs, and even the ""gluten free bread"" contained semolina flour, which is wheat.

I would go back to The Legian in a heartbeat, and have already recommended it to several people. I was just a bit surprised & disappointed regarding the lack of food allergy knowledge.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1086,Perfect Bali Retreat,50,June 2015,"We recently stayed at The Legian in Seminyak and had such a wonderful time!! Not sure where to start but here goes;

Pros:
Accommodation: We stayed in a villa at The Club which gave us a private villa, our own pool, a butler, driver ( for local trips) and an additional choice of location for meals. The whole experience was fantastic. The villa was excellent (if you were really picky you might think the air con was a it loud), we had a lovely outside bath, the private pool was a great temperature and a good size and the whole accommodation was well thought through, beautifully maintained and gave a real feeling of privacy and exclusivity. The only slight downside was that when we arrived and were driven into The Club it is away from the main hotel and initially looked like it was going to be worse - this was far from the case!
Service: was excellent throughout our stay wherever we were. The staff in The Club were fantastic and the way in which every member of the Legian team approached us was very professional, very friendly and all were keen to help as much as they could. Special mention though to our butler Eka who was really lovely with us and helped to make our stay very special.
Food: we were surprised by the quality of the food at every meal. Breakfast includes freshly cooked food, lunch at the pool bar is a must (the nasi goring is to die for) and we ate at the main restaurant, The Club and in our vial and each time the food was wonderful. The Sauvignon Blanc is a bit expensive but considering the overall value of the hotel this is a very small quibble.

We really needed a break and The Legian delivered in every level, we would go back and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

Thank you for a wonderful stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1087,WOW!,50,June 2015,From the moment we arrived to the time we left we couldn’t fault anything about the hotel. The level of service from the staff was excellent and there was a genuine interest in making sure we were looked after 100% of the time. Would recommend using the hotel transfer from the airport. This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in. Ever! Already planning to return next year for a longer stay.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1088,The only place to stay in seminyak Simply superb.,50,May 2015,"We have stayed at the Legian Hotel before. Last visit had to stay elsewhere as the Legian was fully booked. In future I will change my dates, this Hotel is the BEST in Bali, nothing else compares.
Perfect position, in the heart of Seminyak all the best restaurants are within walking distance or if not a maximum 5 dollar taxi fare.
The bodyworks and other fun places are all so close.
The BEST however is the Hotel itself, you do not have to move, the management and staff are truly amazing just cannot do enough for you.
The Food in the Hotel is superb, the chef even put Duck on the menu for us on our final night . My husband said it was the best ""Bebek "" he had had. He's fussy!!!!!!!!
The Day Spa is simply special, treat yourself.
We usually stay on the ground floor, this time on the 3rd floor, equally as good, the rooms are relaxing and beautiful. lots of treats too!!
My favourite place though is under a palm tree down by the beautiful pools looking out to the ocean reading a book. This Hotel is truly amazing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1089,Fit for a Raja!,50,May 2015,"We stayed in a 1-bedroom villa in The Club at The Legian in May, and felt so pampered we really didn't have many reasons to leave the resort.

The experience was great starting from reservations, to the concierge making restaurant recommendations and reservations. We arrived early and the villa wasn't ready as they were running high occupancy - but they gave us a suite to rest and refresh. And moved us to the villa soon as it was ready.

Perks of a villa guest (The Club) : one can start the morning with a 1.5 hrs yoga lesson by the beach front, to an indulgent breakfast, to afternoon tea, to evening cocktails - and all the sunbathing sessions in between. Not forgetting the complimentary mini bar and snacks in the villa, daily laundry, and also a chauffeured car that will drop/pick up to any destination within the Seminyak area, and the return airport transfer too.

The hotel also provided some special arrangements as we were celebrating our anniversary. The butler was more than helpful in seeing to our requests and arrangements. On the day we checked out, the hotel gave us access to another villa to rest as we had a late flight but had to check out earlier.

In Bali, we've stayed at St Regis and W Retreat - and for this trip was considering Banyan Tree, Bvlgari and Ritz Carlton. Am I glad we chose The Legian! They have delivered what the mass market luxury chains can't - personal service that is fit for a Raja! :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1090,A very special resort second to none,50,May 2015,"This resort sets the standard for all to follow. With about 100 rooms it's the perfect size to provide all amenities yet maintain a personal touch. The property is beautiful with 3 pools looking out to the ocean. Staff is on hand to fill your water glass, provide fresh tools and complimentary afternoon tea. But the big surprise is the amazing food on offer. Chef Luke hails from Auz. He marries Southeast asian spices with french technique and local ingredients. The result is 5 star cuisine. We ate 3 out of 4 dinner in the hotel dining room.
Legian is hands down a wonderful place to enjoy your holiday even in crowded Seminyak!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1091,Oh my!,50,June 2015,"This was our 3rd trip to Bali and each time has been a completely different experience. The first time we stayed in a mid range hotel and the experience was average. The 2nd time we stayed in a lovely villa but the location wasn't as good as we hoped despite it looking close to the beach in Seminyak. This time we treated ourselves with a few nights at The Legian hotel and the experience exceeded our wildest expectations. The hotel, the location, the staff, the food, the service, the staff, the staff, the attention to detail, the staff...... Did I mention the staff??!!! I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1092,Outstanding Hotel,50,May 2015,"Just returned from 10 days at The Legian - fourth visit in three years. Location is simply outstanding with all rooms facing the Indian Ocean. The grounds are immaculate, the pool facilities stunning and all matched by subtle yet very attenative service. The staff are genuinely interested, engaged and attentive. They are the reason the experience is so very good. Nothing is any trouble.
Breakfast on the Terrace is a daily joy to be looked forward to. The WiFi is brilliant in the room, by the pool or in the restaurant and my wife enjoyed the complimentary daily yoga.
We have stayed on all four levels in the one bedroom suite on each occasion and all have generous balconies, and upper floors easily accessed by elevators.
The room decor is not marble, brass and mirrors but more traditional Bali decor with generous bathrooms, living areas and bedroom, take your own iPod/iPhone music (although iPod supplied with hotel selected music in each room) because in-room Bose system works great. The property never seems crowded even when quite full, we have never struggled for a well located pool/beach bed. In easy walking distance of great restaurants although Legian restaurant as good as the best.
Hard to stay anywhere else!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1093,An amazing place to stay,50,May 2015,"Nothing was too much trouble, the resort was just fabulous, enjoyed every moment of our stay. The breakfast buffet was international and had a great selection of short order serves, pretty much a la carte.
The pool team were excellent, the service, towels, umbrellas, chilled water and even cool towels and face mist were great.
The spa was fabulous, a two hour spa treatment was under $150!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1094,The Legend,50,May 2015,"What makes people book a hotel? Reviews on Trip Advisor, Location, Price and Pictures! The Legian Bali is hands down topping all of these categories and more.

My wife and I booked 2 nights at the Legian to start our trip to Bali. Seriously was the best decision ever. We choose to have a transfer from the airport included and it was well worth it. Our driver was great at pointing out where we were and what to see.

On arrival at The Legian we were greeted by Eka and checked in with a delightful welcome drink. While taking a sip of my cool ginger tea a well dressed foreign man approached us, it was Andre the new GM. It was a pleasure to meet him and he was very humble. Eka showed us quickly around the hotel and to our suite.

The suites are amazing, we had a studio suite which was quite large. Two deck areas, a lounge and separate bathroom with soaking tub. The complimentary mini bar and snacks are a welcome touch.

We spent most of the two days by the pool, the pool staff were great and knew you by name as soon as you approached.

The food is of the highest quality and the staff at all the F&B areas are amazing, efficient and friendly :).

When I say this hotel has it all it really does, location perfect, staff incredible and you really do get what you pay for!

Thank you Eka and a special mention to Bogas in the pool bar, fantastic service!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1095,A truly amazing stay at the Legian Club,50,May 2015,"After staying at the Legian Club I had a glimpse of what it feels like to be royalty. We were greeted on arrival by the Manager and all the staff and shown straight to our Villa. We were just blown away from the moment we stepped inside. The Villas are sensational, really big spaces, a brilliantly stocked complementary mini bar and as it was our Honeymoon they had the champagne on ice for us which was a lovely touch. Our butler Honi was amazing, nothing was too big an ask and we felt truly spoilt. What makes this hotel so amazing is that everything is so slick and seamless, the drivers collect you to and from the restaurants (always on time), the golf buggy’s take you over to the main hotel, all the staff know who you are and are so friendly, your drinks are replenished without even asking, laundry was done daily, you don’t have to think about anything as they do it for you. The overall serenity of both the hotel and the club was also wonderful, although all the club Villas were occupied you would still never see anyone, even at the main hotel there was hardly anyone around, which made our honeymoon so relaxing and peaceful. We had a complimentary massage at the spa which again was amazing. I cannot fault this hotel and the staff, they made our stay so special and perfect, a honeymoon never to forget.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1096,Special Birthday,50,May 2015,My husband chose to spend his special birthday at The Legian following another visit some time ago which we enjoyed very much. Our two week stay was just superb. Kevin (Manager) and his outstanding staff went out of their way to ensure it was perfect. Could not recommend this holiday destination highly enough. Barbara Gold Coast Australia,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1097,A wonderful service I have ever received!,50,May 2015,Definitely it's a not an inexpensive hotel but worth every penny. The hotel provides a client oriented service and gives you very high standard of detail service. You won't be disappointed and regretted at all!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1098,The very best experience in Bali,50,May 2015,"You do get what you pay for and here you have the very best that Bali has to offer.

The level of service and attention to detail is of the very highest standard and comparable with any top rated hotel you can mention anywhere in the world.

The food is a great experience and again of the highest level and presentation is superb.

Everything around the hotel is kept in top notch order and the rooms are expansive and with fantastic views over the garden area and beach.

Book it and you will not regret it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1099,Sublime service,50,May 2015,"The service levels at the Legian are outstanding and match the best hotels anywhere in the world. Check in for returning guests takes a matter of 5 minutes and your luggage is whisked away to your room before you can say ""abracadabra"".

Little details matter to the staff and we were very impressed when they asked after our children by name despite the fact that that we had not been to stay at the hotel in a year. We were upgraded to a wonderful one bedroom suite during our stay and enjoyed every moment of it.

The Legian could look to improve its rooms as the wifi works erratically and the in room kitchens are very small and dingy for the size of the rooms. Also, it would be great if TVs could be installed in the bedrooms as these are currently in the living room only.

Minor quibbles aside, on a perfect cloudless sunny day, there is nothing which beats lying on a sun lounger under the trees at the Legian and listening to the waves come in. The blue swimming pools sparkle and beckon invitingly - it was a beautiful and utterly sublime holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1100,A great experience,50,May 2015,"I LOVE the pool. The ocean water was warm, the food, service, and accommodations were great. Influenced by there beach, the room wasn't particularly designed to my taste, but the surrounding more than made up for that.
Make sure you take the time to sit down by the infinity pool for a drink at sunset.. The view is calming and breathtaking, the sound of the waves will wash away memories of your work back home.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1101,Pure Excellence,50,May 2015,"Having read many reviews of this hotel we finally decided that this looked to be the place to stay in Seminyak.

From arrival we were more than vindicated in our decision, with the warmest of welcomes including refreshing drinks and cold towels prior to bring shown around the resort and to our room.

One bed deluxe suite was fantastic with space a plenty, four poster bed, separate dining and lounge areas, huge bathroom, kitchen area and 2 balconies equipped with sun loungers and daybed.

Pool area suitably peaceful with wonderfully attentive staff (who always remembered your name), for whom any request wasn't a problem. Cold towels again handed out whilst sunbathing along with cold iced water continuously replenished. Great views of the Indian Ocean from the pool area, and 3 separate infinty pools to allow a well earned cooling dip.

Along to the food, which again surpassed any expectations that we had. Breakfast superb with many choices available to start your day. Lunch available at both the restaurant and poolbars, with quality again being fantastic. Evening meals at the restaurant raise the bar even further under the management of Chef Luke. There will be alternative options to eat in Seminyak but would recommend this restaurant to anyone without hesitation.

Once again cannot praise the staff, service levels and food enough. Hopefully will be fortunate enough to stay here again and am sure we will struggle to find an equal anywhere in the near future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1102,"Promised so much, but.....",20,May 2015,"We came full of expectation to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my wife's birthday. This is definitely a beautiful place and the previous reports are probably in the most part justified so hopefully my negative experience is just a one off. However too many things have gone wrong for me not to make a comment. We stayed in the very expensive but beautiful Club at The Legian. The first night was not great as the sound on the TV wouldn't work despite the technician spending 30minutes messing around with the kit and spoiling our evening. We where then woken up at 7am by music from the reception and revving motorbikes. The Villa comes with a personal butler which is great except you would expect the room to be kept tidy throughout the day with towels folded, mini bar refreshed etc and generally things kept looking immaculate. I also informed the hotel in writing and in person that we are here for a special occasion but they didn't even verbally acknowledged either event which is disappointing. These are probably trivial issues but they have marred the experience. All in all I don't think this should put you off visiting as there is definitely a touch of magic about the Club.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1103,A perfect experience,50,June 2014,"Staying at The Legian for a week was one of the most perfect hotel experiences of my life. Having been to Seminyak several times, I am 100% converted to staying here exclusively.
The service was astounding - some of the best I've ever experienced. The food was delicious, and of course the whole experience felt like paradise. Heaven on earth.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1104,The GOLD standard of resorts!,50,April 2015,"There aren't enough words in the English language to convey my thoughts on this property! This resort was truly an experience! I'm very grateful to have chosen this location given all the options, but now I know why The Legian was listed as #1 here on tripadvisor. As many of the well-travelled guests have mentioned in previous comments, this place places emphasis on every single detail important to every type of traveler. It was all the fine details that made this the experience of a lifetime. Everything starts at the airport where you are greeted by an extremely friendly representative of the hotel who assists you to the hotel's transportation van (highly recommended, although not required). The high-end van is used just for you and your guest. When you arrive, the perfectly sized resort awaits you with it's majestic architecture, grounds, views, and location. They bring you a wonderful welcome drink and refreshing cold towel while you wait for a staff member to check you in. All of this while sitting in comfortable couches in a breezy lobby overlooking the gorgeous property. Get used to everyone knowing who you are and greeting you by your name. It makes you feel very welcomed. The manager, Mr. Abramowicz, came to personally meet us and feel welcomed. This is the most involved, caring, hands-on, and visible General Manager I have every seen on any hotel property in my life! He actually greeted and talked to us on various occasions throughout our stay. Once we got our room, we were escorted to a beautiful 1-bedroom suite overlooking the ocean. This room has everything you can imagine, and I would suggest upgrading from the studio suite if possible. We were there for my birthday and they had a bday cake waiting for me along with an array of small, yet tasty dishes, along with ice cold freshly poured champagne. All of this complementary of course! You arrive to the sounds of relaxing spa like music pumped into every corner of your suite via and IPod and Bose sound system. The huge bathroom is appointed exquisitely with great products and a private toilet area. The stand up shower has great water pressure with rain-like shower head. The tub includes salts for soaking. The bedroom includes very elegant mosquito netting which gets adjusted nightly during turn-down. The balcony has a oversized comfortable day bed where we spent most of our time just looking at the ocean and hearing the sounds of the crashing waves. Room service was not too overpriced and the quality of the food was superb. The main restaurant breakfast buffet was wonderful. The pool-side service was like no other!!!! They had great daily drink specials. Seating around the pool was sufficient and there was always plenty of staff around to set you up in the area you wanted to be. At night, there are many options around the seminyak area to dine and have drinks. My favorites were La Favela (by far) and Ku De Ta. Transportation around town is cheap and finding a taxi back to the hotel is easy. Just make sure you set the price before starting on trip if not in a metered taxi. They tried to swindle us and change price upon return to the hotel one night, but I refused to pay the different fare. But, this was not the fault of the hotel, by any means. I hired a personal driver for a day. He was able to take us all around Bali. We were able to experience the Sacred Monkey forest sanctuary, various impressive hindu tamples, Ubud, and then Finn's beach club toward the end of the afternoon. A whole day driver in a very nice van only costs about $60 (U.S.). It is well worth it. We had our own connection, but the hotel can also arrange for a private driver. I'm just not sure on their prices. When check-out day arrived, I think I went into a state of withdrawal and depression. No one in their right mind would want to leave this place. But unfortunately, we had to go. For those of you who are from the LGBT community, this place could not have been more welcoming; you are never made to feel out of place or uncomfortable. I have done nothing but rave about this place to my friends who will be staying here in the future. I'm positive I will return to Bali, and when I do, it will be to the Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1105,Paradise found!,50,April 2015,"It’s difficult to know where to begin. I read a good number of reviews which all bestowed high levels of praise and so I felt quite happy making my booking but in the back of my mind wondered if it would live up to the hype. For holidays I always like to push the boat out and have stayed in some very nice hotels but The Legian is in a league of it’s own. It starts from the moment you arrive with a slick meet and greet from Kevin, the manager with refreshing cold towels and a restorative. We were lucky enough to enjoy an upgrade to a 1 bed suite and to my mind it was the best room in the house. Sitting in a corner plot on the top floor with views of the Ocean and mountains inland. It was bigger and more luxurious than the London house I lived in! Equipped with all the mod cons you would expect and nice additional extras like a fridge full of complimentary sodas. The hotel and grounds are stunning and the tranquil location is just a short walk from all the action. Breakfast was a joy to behold and if it’s not on the menu they will happily prepare just about anything your heart desires - great for fuelling you up for days hard sunning by the beach/pool.

What I loved most about the hotel were the staff, the people who make it tick. The genuine warmth I encountered from every member of the team without exception was humbling. Their attention to detail blew us away. Especially the little things like topping you up with iced water or moving your parasol a few inches to cover the toes you didn’t realise had made it into the midday sun. To say you’re treated like royalty is no exaggeration. Making my way down to the beach, Adi would be there to greet me – knowing my preferred spot - he sets everything up with the huge smile that I came to know and love. During a bout of tummy trouble Dayu offered to prepare some oatmeal to settle my stomach and a number of staff asked how I was feeling. We felt like part of the family. When it was time to leave the curiously omnipresent Kevin was there to wave us off but not before inviting us to stay a little longer and oh, how we wished we had. The care everybody takes in every aspect of their job shows and was greatly appreciated and we would like to thank you all for making our trip one which will be remembered and cherished always.
PS. Kevin, we salute your dedication to promoting velvety, lush, exquisitely manicured lawns.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1106,Family stay at The Legian,50,May 2015,"As this was our first visit to Bali, I decided that we would stay at The Legian with my husband and 2 adult sons. We had a 2 bedroom suite and had the most wonderful time there. We all loved the pool area it was spectaular as the sun started to go down and the service throughout the whole of the hotel was second to none, the staff we the most friendliest that I have ever come across in all of my stays in hotels. I would definitely go back to this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1107,"Honeymoon in Bali""",50,June 2014,"Outstanding! My husband and I spent an amazing time at the Villas, anything we wished or wanted was at our disposal! I have never experienced such special and attentive service. Our butler was very nice and respectful of our privacy, they arranged for everything from diner reservation to tours of our choice, driver, etc. It was truly a remarkable experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Dato Zainal Abi... A (1 review)

If there is any place you want to be in Bali to stay, well hands down..this is ""the place"".
I have been checking-in here like more'n 11 times already and has never really felt enough as I want to come here again for my next hols.. What I like most about this beautiful property is that the waves from the Indian Ocean are voicing in your ears all the time even while you're asleep, the staffs are very friendly and respectful.. even the rooms are splendid and comfortable beyond what you'd have expected because of their layouts with the famous Seminyak beach just a few steps away from your room. The breakfast ""are to die for.."" (according to my daughters) !

But most of all ""they"" try very hard without us realising (to please us..).
They constantly improve and always the next trip you come again and realised that they have improved and added some new additional facility or service or new additional dish in the menu. This is my best hotel (to be) for me especially to holiday with family..
I urge you to try for a night at least whenever you're in Bali - it is simply awesome..

Dear Dato Zainal Abi… B,

Thank you very much for returning to The Legian Bali again and recommending us to others through TripAdvisor. We are delighted to hear that you had another enjoyable stay with us and that The Legian has become the hotel to stay at whist vacationing with your family.

The entire team and I look forward to welcoming your family and you back soon.

Kindest regards,

1110,One of the Best,50,May 2015,"A very special hotel with uniformly excellent service that I have rarely experienced. The facilities are first class and the location excellent. The sound of waves going to sleep and waking up is hard to beat. A boutique resort means everyone knows your name and there are lots of shady pool loungers to go around. For me, the pool side staff and service made my families stay something special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1111,A perfect stay! Pure luxury - Look no further. Pure heaven & luxury!!,50,April 2015,"An absolutely stunning hotel - Paradise in every way! We stayed here for part of our honeymoon on 13th April & did not want to leave. The hotel is beautiful everywhere you look, the staff are amazing & couldn't do enough for us. We were always greeted with smile & were treated like VIPS! We were upgraded to a one bedroom Deluxe Suite which was very kind of The Legian - Thank you so much! It looks every bit as amazing as it does online. You will not be disappointed & needn't look elsewhere. Our suite was breathtaking & enormous. The most comfortable bed we've ever slept on, amazing bathroom which felt like we were in a spa, a kitchen with unlimited delicious snacks & minibar. A gorgeous daybed on the balcony where we watched the sun set. We loved all the extras including the complimentary daily afternoon tea & the little treats which came as part of the turndown service. We received a bottle of champagne & a delicious cake to welcome us on our honeymoon, and also another cake as it was my husband's birthday 2 days prior. The infinity pools were amazing & the pool attendants so friendly & helpful. Breakfast was delicious with a buffet & full menu service. We were so sad to leave & would definitely return! A five star hotel with 5 star service, we cannot fault The Legian one bit, thank you for making our honeymoon stay so perfect!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1112,Relaxing holiday,50,April 2015,"Do yourself a favour and stay at this wonderful hotel. The service and attention are fantastic. Nothing is a problem , the staff make you feel so important. The location is so close to wonderful restaurants..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1113,Beachside in Bali,50,April 2015,"My husband and I took a trip to Bali recently and had a wonderful stay at The Legian Hotel on the beach in Seminyak. We have been to Bali before and stayed in different locations, but wanted to be near the beach at a place with lots of amenities and a beautiful environment as well as great service and food. On this trip we just wanted to relax. The Legian was fantastic. The location is right on the beach, and the beautiful infinity pool(s) sit just above the beach level surrounded by very comfortable Balinese style outdoor beds. Very nice touch and everything very clean and tidy. Normal chaise lounges were also available. Lots of umbrellas for shade and several bales for even more safety from the sun, if need be. Lots of friendly and well dressed staff outside to tend to ones' every need. The boys set up the cushions, umbrellas, bring multiple towels to line the cushions and leave extras for drying off. The pool/beach staff brings menus and a tray with cold fresh drinking water, spray mist for the face and cold towels for hands and face with a beautiful flower sitting atop. Nice touch. Mind you the water is constantly refreshed and clean towels brought throughout the day.There are two small but well designed bar areas flanking the pools and we had great lighter foods and drinks here almost every day. Very convenient and enjoyable. The main restaurant sits just behind the pool overlooking the sea and the pool area. The chef and restaurant staff is fantastic and we had breakfast here each morning and dinner on several nights here as well. Really, very good food. The hotel sits in it's own beautiful maintained grounds with lots of greenery and flowering plants and trees. There are beautifully maintained coy ponds in and around the hotel with lots of healthy and enthusiastic orange, white and black fish swimming about with water lilies and tropical plants surrounding them. Rooms are beautifully appointed and ours was stocked with lots of fruit, bar snacks and drinks, coffee and tea making supplies. We could enjoy a nibble in the room if we wanted to without bothering to call anyone. Maid service was fantastic and amenities were well thought out. Plenty of towels, Aqua de Parma toiletries and a fully stocked bath area with candles and incense. Balinese batik styled robes and comfy new flip-flops await you and there is also a nice beach bag in the closet for one's use, which is very helpful for all of those trips, not only to the pool or beach, but to do some local shopping. There was a loaded iPod and nice sound system in the room. A television and DVD player also in the main sitting room area and a library of movies were available to borrow at the concierge desk. The private, outdoor terrace for our room also had a Balinese reclining bed. I could go on and on, but everything was taken care of in the best possible way. It just felt very nice to be guest at The Legian. It's a very tranquil environment and beautiful place.

The Spa services were great. I had three different treatments and they were all very good. I also took the free yoga class every morning which I enjoyed and I made use of the fitness area to burn off a few extra calories.

I have to say that very nice people were staying at the hotel as guests when I visited - from all over the world. There were a few families with children, but there was plenty to keep the kids busy. Lots of couples and groups of friends as well. So a great place to visit, without feeling crowded. The atmosphere is tranquil and relaxing. There is security on site, so people cannot just walk up from the beach onto the grounds. . .although there is no physical gate, which is lovely.....just people checking to make sure that you, as a guest, are not disturbed for any reason. Also, there is a gated entrance from the road, so the entire place is well contained. It is very easy to walk out to the beach or the street to take advantage of area restaurants and shops and arranging for taxis, private drivers or excursions is very easy. There are beach sports available, including surfing lessons right there as well. And other activities can be arranged by the hotel. I have to say that the staff was fantastic. They made a point of calling us by our names throughout our stay and we miss them already! Just go there.....you won't regret it. I can't wait to go back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1114,Stunning,40,February 2015,Our second visit to Bali and we have choosen to stay in the same resort we stayed before.Everything is great about this resort especially the service.we will come back for sure when we visit Bali again.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1115,Home from home...,50,April 2015,"We weren't expecting it to be so chic, but it was just stunning: the decoration and the service. The premiss of a hotel is to be a home from home and they have succeeded!

The moments of ""added value"" were just wonderful: free surfing lessons, free surfboards and body boards to use, free snack before bed, free minibar of soft drinks, free sun set drink. The list went on and on...

The only downfall was the hotels single glazing it was so noisy. Leaf blowers would start at 8am, not ok for a holiday destination. And the spar were a bit pushy with their selling tequniques, I had to keep saying no.

The staff were so smiley and happy: Adi and Juni were so sweet.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1116,Service has improved greatly!,40,April 2015,"This is my second stay at The Legian and I must say that between my last stay a few years ago and just last week, I did notice quite a number of improvements on the property as well as on the overall service. The infinity pool used to be just one main pool but now there are 3 different pools (stacked next to each other but separate) all looking out to the beach. The spa and gym have also been renovated and are impressively larger. The staff were attentive, friendly and always helpful. Breakfast was fantastic. The grounds were well kept and maintained and for the most part mosquito free (except in the grass areas and around dusk). Both the general manager and assistant manager came by for a quick chat during our stay. I can tell that they have put in a lot more effort and training these past few years in order to raise the bar on all fronts for this well located and well appointed Seminyak beach resort. I would give this a 4.5 stars experience. By all means, there's not a lot of fault and I would stay here again...however, in ranking this against other 5 star experiences I have had, there's just a smidgen of room for further improvements like perhaps slight upgrades to the rooms and the furniture inside as humidity has taken a toll on all the wood furnishings giving the closets and blinds an aged scent/odor. And the doors and hinges in the rooms could be further fixed (the bathroom door for example was always ajar and we had to hold it in place with a shoe or garbage can). If these areas could be improved, I think the hotel could very well be in the true 5 star category.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1117,Beautiful and memorable,50,April 2015,"Just back from a 4 night stay at the hotel. I wish I'd stretched it out to a week!

Seminyak is still the place to stay in Bali if you want hip restaurants and bars, good shopping and an amazing beach view.

The Legian is a calm, luxurious escape from the somewhat chaotic local streets, located halfway between Ku De Ta and Potato Head (trendy beach clubs).

Staff are simply wonderful, from the pick up at the airport, the care and personal attention during the stay, the service at the restaurants (don't miss the Balinese food at the Club Restaurant), my driver who took me to Ubud and Batur for a wonderful 9 hour day trip - to the escort back to the airport and departure gates!

My suite was the slightly more expensive category, with stunning sea views over the manicured lawns and gardens. I am sure the slightly smaller suites are just as nice. They are gorgeously furnished, with gigantic bathrooms, amazing beds and balconies.

The breakfasts are above the usual Asian hotel fare, with very tasty options. I had just come from a week at the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore and this was much, much better. All hot breakfasts are cooked to order, which is a nice touch.

The beach is beautiful and not overcrowded. Strong currents and large waves made it unsuitable for swimming most days but I did have a couple of swims under the watchful eye of the lifeguard. The swimming pools are fabulous.

Not a cheap hotel but money well spent. Thanks to all the lovely staff who made it extra special for me!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1118,Wonderful hotel!,50,May 2015,"I love this hotel for the service, the food, the people, the pools, the beach....Everything! Every penny spent at this hotel was worth the price! No matter where you are, there is always someone nearby looking to help you out! Good job! Will definitely come back next time! I am writing this review right now sitting at the lobby of the second hotel we have booked for our trip (Ay*na) and I am totally regretting not staying at the legion bali for my entire stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1119,The BEST all around 5-star hotel in Seminyak!,50,June 2014,"If you are looking for the best place to stay in Seminyak area, 5-star hotel, then the answer is The Legian by GHM. The location, service, rooms, and view are perfect. We've tried many other luxury hotels in the area, but our favorite is still the Legian. The management does an awesome job maintaining the property, and they always keep the facilities in excellent shape!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1120,The Legian Revisited,50,May 2015,"It's been two years since visiting the Seminyak area and this time I wanted to spend some time exploring the new restaurants and cafes in Seminyak, my fiancée and I decided to revisit The Legian and stayed for 4 nights in a one bedroom suite. The experience was a good if not better then the last. We could see the landscape changes like the pool was extended much closer to the beach and looked like an infinity pool reaching out to the beach area. The food menu also offered some interesting offerings like grilled water melon salad, local classic dishes like Babi Gulling and one of my favorite that was not on the before before-yellowfin tuna steak. Staff was also friendly n remembered our names as they greeted us whenever we met. We were also invited to the Beach house for a cocktail reception hosted by the GM. I have to say the beach house is stunning - 3 rooms upstairs with the master bedroom overlooking the sea. I have to gather some friends to come back and experience this lovely property

Overall we had a very pleasant stay at The Legian. I look forward to my next stay here as I come back to explore more adventures in Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1121,Great stay at The Legian Bali,50,April 2015,"I was on a very quick pit stop in Bali last weekend, and spent a night at The Legian.
All in all a great experience. They met me at the airport, sorted out VOA, and then had a car waiting to drive me to the hotel.
From when I arrived, the staff did their outmost to make my stay as nice as possible, and it was highly appreciate.
I stayed in a great 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor with great views of the pool area and ocean.
I will definitely recommend The Legian to anyone who wants to stay in a nice place in Seminyak.
Only little thihng I could put my finger on that they can improve is the stability of the WIFI, as I had a few connection issues on the balcony.
Thanks again to the staff for a great experience throughout!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1122,None better in Seminyak!,50,April 2015,"We stayed in the Club Legian which is across the road from the main hotel in a private pool villa. Ari our butler was outstanding and the staff generally were top notch. We have stayed at other private pool villas in Seminyak but these guys are so far the best we have experienced and I would have no hesitation in recommending them.

Food was all very good but they could do with adding healthier options on room service menu and at the Club lounge
Rooms were excellent
Bed was comfortable
Pool was clean

Will be staying there again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1123,"Unbelievable service, gorgeous hotel and location!",50,April 2015,"My husband and I stayed at The Legian for our 25th wedding anniversary last week. We had such a memorable experience thanks to the wonderful staff and service at the hotel.

The hotel is situated along the beach at Seminyak and the location is handy to many restaurants and shops. It's 200 metres to Seminyak Square through a shortcut and we also walked to some local restaurants like Bambu, KuDeTa and Potato Head (although Bluebird taxi's are cheap we enjoyed the walk). The grounds of the hotel are lush and the 3 level infinity pool sublime. Afternoon tea (included) by the pool was such a treat and became a ritual nearly everyday!

We stayed in a lovely studio suite on the 3rd floor which was quiet and had perfect views of the beach and ocean. It was lovely to sit on the balcony and hear the waves and see the sun setting. The amenities in the room - the Nespresso machine for great coffee - the iPods loaded with great music - the free minibar (not alcohol) - free blue ray DVDs to watch in room are all a great bonus. The breakfast included was delicious and of very high standard. We also had dinner in the restaurant on our last night which was amazing. Loved the lobster ravioli!

However, the main reason this hotel is so fantastic is due to its wonderful staff who are friendly, courteous, professional and attended to all our needs with a smile. I forgot my iPad cord and was asking concierge how far to go to buy one but no please bring it to concierge and we will see if we have one that works which you can borrow during your stay. Not to mention the several restaurant bookings they made for us! On the day of our anniversary all the staff we encountered wished us a Happy Anniversary. We received champagne, a delicious cake and flowers which was a tremendous surprise as most hotels don't go beyond a bottle of wine. The staff greeted us by name all the time which was so lovely and personal. Also to meet the General Manager and Assistant General Manager is pretty rare these days in any hotel and it was great to give them both the feedback they deserve.

While you may pay a bit more than the other hotels on the beach this one includes so much and gives you such a personal experience that makes for a truly memorable holiday!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1124,Fantastic Hotel,50,December 2014,"The hotel exceeded all my expectations - right from the airport pickup to the drop off at our next hotel. It's located in a fantastic location, the staff is extremely friendly and well trained, the manager makes sure every one feels special, the rooms are very well designed and appointed, and the resort is pretty much - perfect.

We stayed at another hotel after spending three nights at the Club at the Legian and were regretting our decision. Right from the time our breakfast arrived to the time we went to bed, we were well taken care off. The pool is wonderful, the beach is great, the food is delicious. Next time I'm in Bali - I am definitely staying here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1125,Perfect location,50,April 2015,"A wonderful hotel, perfectly managed. The service is outstanding ! We stayed at the Club in one of the Villas, extremely spaceous, private Butler Service, which truly deserves its name. Thanks again to the whole team....",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1126,Boutique hotel at its very best - perfection!,50,April 2015,"We returned to The Legian recently for our fourth stay and instantly remembered why we love it - perfect, tranquil Balinese style and setting, excellent food (both local and international) and immaculate, friendly, personalised service. Our six year old son (who is a world traveller) was so impressed and doted upon he asked ""Why am I treated like a king here?!""... Well, we know how he feels and we will all be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1127,The best hotel in Seminyak,50,November 2014,My adult daughter and I stayed at the Legian Bali in November 2014 and had loved our time there. We felt we were in paradise in the beautiful infinity pools and found we were constantly humming Louis Armstrong's song Cheek to Cheek. Fabulous in every way - this is the place to stay! We will be returning later this year.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1128,A beautiful paradise!,50,March 2015,"We had an excellent stay at the Club Villas at the Legian Bali. It was even more stunning than we expected from the pictures on the website. Our villa, pool and grounds were extremely beautiful; as was the Club Lounge and the Hotel. One delightful aspect of our stay that we didn’t expect was our butler Hendra. We have had butlers on cruises, but have never had such an experience as we did with Hendra. He was extremely professional and at the same time a real pleasure to know, he took very good care of us and we would highly recommend him. All other members of the staff that we met were also exceptionally friendly and helpful. We hope to return and spend more time at this beautiful paradise.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1129,Incredible stay at The Legian,50,April 2015,"Quite simply, this is the best hotel stay I have had in my life. Firstly, the property is impeccably maintained. the rooms are nicely appointment in Balinese style. The infinity pools are breathtaking, and the views of Seminyak Beach are indescribable. The food was perfect. We usually like to eat at local restaurants away from our resorts, but we found ourselves continually coming back for perfectly executed room service or a delicious meal in the restaurant.

What makes The Legian special, however, is the staff. The resort has 68 suites and 11 villas but it has a staff of 350! Each customer-facing employee quickly learns the names of every customer and treats you like you are an honored guest in their home. I know the Balinese have a culture that views tourists like a gift from God, but The Legian takes this principle to a different level. The second we needed something, someone noticed our body language change and approached us before we had a chance to look for a staff-member. Every request was met with a warmth I've never experienced as a customer of any business.

The GM and Assistant GM took the trouble to seek us out for a pleasant conversation. The Assistant GM even apologized for the overcast day. When we told him we didn't mind the clouds, and everything was still so beautiful, he said ""yes, I noticed you spend most of your time in the shade."" From the top down, they make it a point to pay as much attention as possible to each guest and their needs.

You can certainly find less expensive places to stay on Bali, but my emphatic recommendation is the Legian. We will be back for sure.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1130,Faultless,50,April 2015,"A fantastic week staying in a 1 bedroom suite. The level of service was impeccable, very high class but not 'in your face'. The suite was excellent, many very thoughtful touches including a fantastic music selection on an iPod, a well stocked and largely complimentary mini bar. The bathroom was very well designed. Food in the hotel was of the highest quality, ranging from breakfast, lunch in the outside bar, daily tea with cakes, dinner and lovely sweet snacks awaiting us in the room. A truly memorable week, thank you.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1131,never ever better,50,March 2015,"Over time we have stayed in a number of luxury resorts and hotels (the Bale, the Chedi, LHW's a.s.o.) so I feel entitled to compare. We never ever stayed in a place better than The Legian. All members of the staff, whatever function they have, are pleasantly friendly and polite. Although the location, the superb quality of the suites, the rich breakfast and the fine restaurant are all by itself reason enough to recommend this excellent hotel, the staff is -no doubt- its main asset.
The Legian aspires and succeeds to be perfect in all details (see photo: even the table linnen is ironed while laying the tables). I cannot imagine staying in another hotel during a next stay on Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1132,Perfect in every way,50,April 2015,"First of all. We travel a lot, and are pretty spoiled. The Club at the Legian was amazing in every way. We had our privacy at the Club, with its lounge and our Villa, but still were able to use the hotels facilities as the modern and well equipped gym, all the restaurants and pools. If we wanted to go from the Club to the hotel, a short walk, they drove us in a buggy.
Also it was impressive how the whole staff knew you by name.
Our butler, Agus, was just amazing. Always there if you needed him.
The area around The Legian has a lot of restaurants in walking distance. Agus gave us good recommendations, and did all the table reservation for us. The club car drove us and picked us up complimentary .
We came to the Club a couple of days before the busy Easter Holiday, and it suited us perfectly to be able to ""escape"" to our Villa and Club Lounge when the hotel started to fill up. With a total of 11 villas, the Club was never crowded.
Traveling without children, the Club comes highly recommendable.
This was a completely recreational vacation - everything was taken care of.
Wish the Club the huge success they deserve - the whole product is a league of its own.
We hope to come back soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1133,Perfect! But not for kids.,30,March 2015,"I loved and hated the Legian.

First, what I loved. The hotel is perfect. The room was gorgeous. The snack waiting for us in the room after we checked in was excellent. The fish feeding was fun. The location is excellent. The sleep quality and housekeeping are great. The nightly cookies were delicious. The DVD menu is extensive. The staff, even people who we had not met yet, addressed us by name within an hour of us checking in. The breakfast buffet was very good. Two of the pool staff helped us put together a complicated kite that we had just bought at the beach. The main pool is great with a kid-friendly slope. It's deserving of its spot as one of Indonesia's best hotels.

But...

I was traveling with my 9-year-old daughter. She's been all over the world and has stayed at some of the best hotels. She was not welcome at the Legian. It was the most bizarre thing. When we checked in, even before I handed them my credit card, I was given a letter signed by the General Manager. The letter stated ""while a number of our guests are travelling without children and would also like to enjoy the tranquil surroundings, our children's policy is that every child must be accompanied by their parents...within the hotel premises and especially around The Pool and Beach."" It also stated that there is one pool where children are not allowed, that inflatable toys are not allowed, and that children should dine at the earlier seatings.

I fully understand that some families have less-well-behaved kids. But to take the ""guilty until proven innocent"" approach was insulting. I like to stay at nice hotels. And I like to travel with my kids. The Legian's website doesn't make it seem like kids are unwelcome, and they even provide kid activities during specific periods during the year, so to arrive and find out that they don't like kids was surprising. I've literally never seen anything like it before in many, many years of travel. And it was completely unnecessary. My daughter wouldn't have bothered anyone anyway, but by giving us that letter it negatively impacted our stay. It meant that my daughter couldn't relax in one of the big chairs in the lobby and read if I wasn't with her. It meant that she couldn't walk down to the concierge desk to borrow a DVD by herself. And it had a more subtle impact on us. The DVD player in the room went between very quiet and very loud. We were so paranoid about constantly adjusting the volume so as not to bother other guests that we could barely enjoy the (kids) movies. We were incredibly quiet walking around the hotel. We woke early to be in and out of breakfast as early as possible. Whenever we spoke to the staff, I almost felt like I had to apologize for bringing a child to their hotel. It was not a comfortable stay.

I wrote back and forth with Kevin, the GM, when we got back home. He apologized that the letter came across as restrictive, but did not apologize for the letter itself. Without that letter, we would have thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It's not the most kid-friendly hotel, but like I said at the beginning, it's a great place and it's extremely well-run. We absolutely would not have bothered other guests anyway. I would encourage other $500/night, 5-star hotels not to go the way of being anti-family. GHM's other Bali property, the Chedi Club, was far more welcoming to us. Both Four Seasons properties that we visited were extraordinarily kid-friendly. It was really disappointing that the Legian was not. If you are traveling without kids, I would highly recommend the Legian. If you have kids under 12, I would look at other hotels.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1134,True Luxury,50,April 2015,"Our stay exceeded all expectations, making the trip to Bali one of the highlights of an eight week adventure. The staff are tremendous being both attentive and courteous, whilst managing to be unobtrusive. We would have no hesitation in returning, a true oasis of tranquility.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1135,Magnificent,50,October 2014,"Gorgeous hotel, staff and grounds. The best service we have ever received. Loved every minute! Well worth the cost. Loved the morning yoga followed by a delicious breakfast. Iced water delivered to your deck chair all day long. We will be back again soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1136,Fantastic Place,50,February 2015,"This is definitely the place to be if you'd like to stay in the Seminyak area. Great combination of posh tropical architecture, great location near top spots in Seminyak, spacious and luxurious suites, beautiful looking tiering pools and most of all - great service and friendly staff, from reception, pool/ bar manager, housekeeping to the GM! This hotel has been around for sometime, but with superb maintenance, it continues to look quite stunning. The location is very ideal, with direct beach access to many establishment like PotHead, KuDeTa etc. A must stay for me in my next trip to Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1137,AMAZING VIEW and VERY ACCOMMODATING STAFF,50,October 2014,"I have been here last October 2014 with my niece during her sembreak. We found this very AWESOME place because of the amazing and stunning view we never seen before.

The room was very simple yet lovely, pleasant and comfortable, the view from it was hmmmm so relaxing. The bathroom was so nice because it was very neat and clean.

We just so inloved with the delightful foods they served for us. Taking our breakfast infront of the amazing view of the beach was our remarkable experienced in here.

The staff are very accommodating, nice, friendly and jolly. This place was great and well managed. Cant wait to see them again this coming October.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1138,"Amazing position, classy property!",50,April 2015,"We stayed at the Club at the Legian. Superb Villa, great appointments, own swimming pool and everything one could ask for. Breakfast at the hotel facing the sea was outstanding. The free shuttle to and from any destination in town(for Villa guests) was very useful! Afternoon tea at the Club was disappointing. We did not really use but really liked the free well stocked mini bar. The Nespresso machine was well used but we would have liked to have a milk frothed and milk supplied - so it was espresso or nothing. Great staff, fabulous swimming pool and lovely beach access and views.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1139,remarkable. unforgettable,50,March 2015,"One of the most remarkable hotels I've ever had the pleasure to stay in. We stayed at the CLUB at the legian (a separate enclave of ~10 private villas with their own pool that is across the street from the main hotel. The club has it's own large pool, bar, dining area - very private). Our villa had wonderful 'butler' services from Chandra who unpacked and packed our bags, restocked our bar and snacks, made reservations, ran our bath, and set up special requests). The hotel itself is on a beautiful and immaculate beachfront. Service is seamless and discrete but universally friendly and warm. Every request is anticipated. Breakfast was sumptuous and combined buffet and made-to-order items including local and international fare. Wifi is high quality and universally accessible and free. Spa is excellent and therapists are talented. The small guest number (only about 70 rooms total) makes for an intimate experience. Manager routinely circulates and makes guests feel welcome. Everything was just perfect, really. Amazing to find a place that gets it all so right.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1140,The Club at the Legian - Outstanding! You won't want to leave!,50,March 2015,"We stayed in a villa at the Club at the Legian. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, our stay was flawless. The staff is attentive, friendly and warm. Our butler, Chandrah saw that all of our needs were met. She was fantastic! They offer unpacking services, daily laundry, packing, not a detail is missed! The villas are beautifully appointed - a water feature in the garden, a private dining area under a gazebo where you can have breakfast or other meals, sitting areas, private pool, outdoor soaking tub, and a canopy bed to name a few. The villa is surrounded by beautiful wood carved pocket doors that open allowing you to enjoy both the indoor and outdoor space together. Two fully loaded iPods and Bose sound docks were great additions to the space. Once daily the mini bar is refreshed with a plentiful assortment of beverages (beers, sodas, coffees, teas), spirits and snacks.

Our breakfast options were either in the villa, in the club or at the hotel restaurant on the beach. We opted to go the the beach each day to enjoy the seaside view. There breakfast was a combination of buffet and a la carte. Everything was always made to perfection! We had lunch at the club and a rice table dinner at the club. Both were terrific.

We had two couple massages during our stay. The spa is on the beach and the treatment room has a window that faces the water. Both times, each of our therapists were excellent.
Going to the beach was a treat with the delivery of frangipani scented cool towels, a mister and ice water. The beach bar mixed a number of great drinks - none of which disappointed. Overall - I would go back to the Legian in a minute! It was impeccable!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1141,Top Hotel with Top Service and management,50,March 2015,"From the first moment we checked in till the late check out, it was a perfect stay, well companied by very good trained and experienced staff, well managed by international managers and the price is worth to pay, even the weather was not that good, the stay was a perfect time with great people and good entertainment all the time...also the breakfast buffet is a very nice experience, lot of different food with wonderful presentation....we will come back...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1142,Heaven on earth!!,50,March 2015,"We have stayed in many wonderful hotels all over the world but what we experienced at The Legian is hard to beat.
From the moment we arrived we were warmly greeted with smiles, refreshing cold towels and a delicious welcome drink.
Shortly after we were taken to our one bedroom suite which was absolutely magnigicent! It was a 3 room suite which comprised of one area with a separate bar, powder room, dining table with 4 chairs, sitting area to watch tv, a beautiful large bedroom with a 4 poster bed and ample his and hers cupboard space, and an extremely large bathroom with 2 separate basins.
The pool area is simply amazing with 3 large infinity pools all overlooking the beach. There are many pool attendants and staff who are constantly friendly, always smiling and greet you by your name. They will set up your chair or day bed for you and bring you iced cold glasses of water along with refresher towels and a green tea spray mist. Fantastic attention to detail and fabulous service. The water is constantly refilled. There is a complimentary afternoon tea served daily between 4 and 6pm which is delicious!
Breakfast was superb which was partly buffet as well as a la carte.
The Legian is perfectly situated as its a short stroll to Oberoi St where you will find a huge variety of fabulous restaurants and shops. There is a lane directly across the road which takes you to Seminyak Square.
We cannot thank Kevin and his wonderful staff enough for making our stay so pleasurable and enjoyable. We had such a wonderful time and we look forward to coming back in the near future.
Now that we have experienced a stay at The Legian we wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1143,Magnificent,50,March 2015,"Great service, friendly staff, good food, clean premises, walking distance to Seminyak where there are great restaurants, shops, bars.. Whole nine yards! The only down side is sea is only for surfers.. But the pool is fantastic, great sunset.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1144,Exceptional Stay,50,March 2015,"I have stayed approx 6 times at The Legain, and every time I come away thinking ""There is no better place"". The standard of service, the hotel, the food, the views, the drinks - nothing can be faulted. We went to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary, on the day we were surprised with a lovely cake and bottle of champagne. Every staff member wished us well on the day - there would not be many resorts in the world that would do this. Every staff member new our name, and greeted us accordingly.

The rooms are quite luxurious, but understated at the same time. They have everything you could think of, including a beach bag to take your belongings to the pool in. The beds are very comfortable, and a wonderful bonus of free non-aloholic drinks and snacks from the mini bar, which was replenished everyday.

The Wifi was excellent, the gym on the premises was a pleasure to work out in. There are plenty of sun beds around the pool area, with the staff providing towels, refreshing face spray and ice cold water (which was topped up constantly).

Thank you to Kevin and Rohan - you provided a wonderful holiday once again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1145,"Lovely grounds, exceptional service",50,April 2014,"My fiancé and I had the pleasure of staying at the The Legian Bali in April 2014 and we can not recommend it enough. The rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. The products used in the bathrooms were fantastic. We very much enjoyed being greeted with cocktails and canapes - both of which were delicious. The poolside service was outstanding - our drinks were consistently filled up and the staff made sure we were well taken care of. The breakfast choices were varied and all very delicious. All in all, everything was perfect! If we are every in Seminyak again, we will be sure to stay at The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1146,Immaculate,50,February 2015,"Recently stayed two nights at The Legian.

The room product is just excellent, well selected furniture, modern Bose speakers, lots of space, television and smart arranged amenities. All the employees at The Legian are very competent and friendly.

I personally loved the nuts and the large variety of drinks to chose from provided in the room. Also enjoyable to have Nespresso machine in the room. The gym is very modern and well equipped with technogym machines. Also loved the fresh coconut water set up for refreshment after or during the workout.

The pool is undescribable. Afternoon tea with paradisiacal view. Well selected materials and comfortable sunbeds.

Enjoy the sunset from the balcony or The Restaurant and enjoy deliciously prepared foods.

Very memorable stay, looking forward to be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1147,This place is the best!,50,March 2015,"Ok, so I have read the other reviews and it is hard not to repeat what they say.

1) The service is some of the best service I have experienced, globally. The attention on detail and the care factor, is incredible

2) The rooms are excellently laid out and of a very high finish

3) We felt, it's location was just right. On a great stretch of beach and a stones throw from all the busy bits

It would be hard to go back to Bali and not stay here again. Superb!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1148,Perfection in Seminyak,50,August 2014,"We stayed at the Club at the Legian twice last year with our 4 year old son in a one bedroom villa and could not speak more highly of our experience. The villa and service was excellent. Any small hiccups were treated seriously and swiftly addressed. The privacy in the villas was lovely, while it was good to also have the opportunity to visit the hotel portion of the property. Our butler was first class. They remembered what we liked from our first stay, from the type of cake our son liked to having a top sheet on the bed, and really made us all feel at home. From arrival at the airport to departure, you are looked after by the Legian team. It really makes for a stress free holiday.
The only complaint I have is that they don't have a two bedroom villa for when we return with our new baby!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1149,Very nice topclass hotel,50,December 2014,"This is a very nice hotel. We have been there several times now. It is a classic.
The service is excellent, the rooms are spacious and nice. It is very well located. The beach is not really idyllic as one would expect on a tropical island but it is ok.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1150,5 star Superior service,50,March 2015,"From the moment we arrived,we were totally looked after in every sense.
Our Butler Merta, provided service above our expectations.Attention to detail,there was nothing that we even needed to ask for as it had already been pre thought of
My Husband and I have travelled to Bali many times and this is the most memorable.
The breakfast staff provided service at world standard as do the pool staff that remember your name and were you last sat so as to prepare again.
Highly recommended ,Location is ideal,on beach and walking distance to all restaurants.
Ohh and a driver to drive you if you really dont want to walk",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1151,"An Oasis of luxury, peace and calm in hip, happening Seminyak.",50,April 2014,"Great location, beautiful rooms - spacious, stylish, private and all overlooking the gardens to the beach. The service and staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble, anticipating your needs - even those you didn't know you had. While lazing on the sun lounges by the beach they provide cool towels, sun screen, water all included, and with regular checks to see if one wants a top-up. The spa is fantastic and one can get a massage by the beach if you prefer.
Afternoon tea by the pool is included - if you can drag yourself away from the pool and the sun lounges.
All this and you are centrally located in the heart of Seminyak with so many fantastic bars, restaurants and shopping close by. The Legian is a true getaway from it all, we met people who have been coming every year for 10 years and who could blame them - we may do the same.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1152,A True Luxury Experience,50,March 2015,"Coming back to The Legian is like coming home. A place nestled in madness of Seminyak, a true sanctuary. Refinement and service at its best, The Legian is a gem. I look forward to my next trip and enjoying all life's simple pleasures!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1153,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,December 2014,"We arrived the day after Boxing Day and stayed until the first week of January. We weren't in love with Seminyak but fell in love with this hotel and all their wonderful staff. On every level they were fabulous. The property is small enough that it feels intimate...we always felt safe and comfortable on the grounds. But it's the people who work there that make you feel special. We travel all over the world for business and pleasure and that is an uncommon thing in the hospitality business unfortunately. My wife and kids used the spa and had glowing reviews, I used the weight room and exercise equipment and found it to be suitably equipped. Every morning we were there they had a free yoga class on the grass in front of our room. How could you not join :) If you are looking for a cozy, private, and quiet hotel to stay at but would like to be located amongst all the bars and restaurants then this is definitely the place to stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1154,Precision and opulence,50,February 2015,"The managements attention to detail is a byword at The Legian as Kevin and his assistant manager Rahaan are consistently in touch with clientele.
The elevated grounds of the hotel look down across the public beach with its strong tide in a stunning vista plus a fantastic swimming pool that has a separate stretch for the more defined swimmer while the sunbathing areas on decks,lawns or around the bathing area are plentiful and comfortable with many staff to assist .
Rooms are huge and well appointed for every convenience and as mentioned the top floors maybe get the best views ,bathrooms are excellent and well maintained by staff.
Air con is easy to adjust while the mosquito nets over the bed are another reason this venue continues to wow its guests with such added attention.
Food is good all round and as everywhere in Bali the drinks are not cheap but that is hardly The Legians fault,grounds are impeccable with yoga classes complimentary at around 8.30 am on the lawn in front of the charming fitness room that is spotless(rowing machine or 2 would be more beneficial than one or two of the standard machines that are in there) .
Seminyak has purportedly the best shopping in Bali and the traffic is incessant down the main drag about 10 minutes from the hotel with taxis and bikes going head to head in a battle for pollution but no time to watch as you have to make sure not to break your ankle on the conundrum that is called Pavement! In rush hour what little flat area this represents is mounted consistently by random motorcycle/moped/scooters in an attempt to beat the queues.
Taxis drivers admittedly don't have the best conditions but have this uncontrollable habit of honking their horns every time they pass any pedestrian without a passenger inside possibly to attract them or maybe to let them know how foolish they look to risk life and limb on said paving area ? The fares are very cheap but drivers are well aware of this fact and have devised a game called ""Cheat the client"" which normally consists of not turning on the clock/meter and then asking a variety of questions to the unsuspecting at the drop off....one perpetrator asked me ""you tell me how much"" but was disappointed to realise I had played the game before and looked crestfallen when I handed over the correct amount I had paid a few days earlier off a less scrupulous man.This taxi game can wear you down a bit and you can look at it two ways either they are poor people or that they are trying to rob you your decision but the fact remains you often need taxis for short journeys to restaurant's etc because the walking along roadside is so bad.
Hotel is near to most good restaurants best local for us was Bambu and best all round by a million miles was at the St Regis Hotel near the airport which Kevin the manager organised for us very kindly,we went evening but the Sunday brunch is said to be sensational.
Staff in this hotel(and there are a lot of them)are so so nice while the concierge in particular deserve special mention.
Nice Hotel, make sure to give added instructions for laundry items especially trousers.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1155,One of the best (Big Thumbs Up) hotel,50,June 2014,"My partner and I went there for a short break from work. Great hotel pick up from the airport, excellent service without having to feel intimidating or overly friendly. Each of the staff member will remember each of the guest name on the list, whether you are out the pool or down near the cafe at the beach, the staff will address you by your family name; which is quite impressive. They serve very authentic Balinese's food and scrumptious cocktails.

The room was great with panoramic water view(very Balinese with exotic interior deco), very spacious and very clean. Every evening when you return to your room you will be served fresh finger food.

We find that absolute outrage that they are providing Aqua Di Parma toiletries.

Location of The Legian is very central, all the shops, cafes, clubs, bars and cafes are just door step away.

mUST StAY - great experience",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1156,"Incredible staff, great pool and amazing beach setting.",50,February 2015,"The staff are the biggest asset to The Legian - they we all incredible. It was lovely that they greeted us warmly by name every time we walked past - and nothing was ever too much trouble. My luggage was accidentally taken from the airport by a local person who had a similar suitcase and the staff took care of everything, ensuring it arrived safely. We were also immediately upgraded to a larger suite. Although is an older style of hotel compared to others like the W, for me it was more authentic, more Balinese, more peaceful and serene. We loved staying at the W Retreat as well but it was fairly intense and for us it was not as relaxing - we would only want to stay a couple of days there whereas at The Legian we felt as though we could happily move in and never leave. The morning yoga classes on the grass were great - with a really charming local yoga teacher. The pool area fantastic with lots of lounges and great service and the beach is clean for swimming in this area compared to further south. I loved it and would stay again although I agree with other reviews that it is pricey.

Anya Brand",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1157,Best Hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2015,"We have only been home for a day and wishing we could be back at The Club at The Legian in Seminyak. From the moment we arrived at the airport we were greeted by a warm, smiley Legian staff member. Cold towels and drinks in the Lexus assured for a pleasant journey to the hotel. GM - Kevin was there to greet us at our Villa in The Club alongside was Widestra, our butler for the week.
On walking into our Villa the first reaction was WOW. Lovely private pool and grounds, spacious bedroom, sitting area and bathroom. Only suggestion would be to put a slightly more comfortable couch in the sitting area but all in all you shouldn't be in there that much anyway. It is expensive but we saw it as value for money with the inclusions you receive. And they go out of their way to make your special occasion very memorable.
The hotel grounds are kept in immaculate condition, the 3 tiered main pool is a lovely setting and the restaurant serves delicious food. Chef Luke cooked us a fabulous dinner on our first night and highly recommend it. You are spoilt for choice with restaurant options in the area, Sarong, Mamasan, Ku de Ta, La Lucca all excellent choices.
I am saving my praise for last for ""Wid"" our Butler for the week. Anything we wanted, from restaurant bookings, private car bookings, cleaning of the villa and just being there if we had a question, his attention to detail was impeccable. He is a true gentleman who is a major asset to the Legian who demonstrates outstanding level of hospitality service.
I could keep going on and on about how great The Legian is, so to Kevin, Widestra and the team we thank you for a wonderful stay and we look forward to returning soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1158,Brilliant staff!,40,March 2015,"The best part of this hotel are the staff, who met all our requests timeously and efficiently. However, this hotel was overpriced for what it offered. It is generally old, although well maintained and clean. We visited during the rainy season and there were no indoor activities organised on days when the weather was bad and no kids activities at all as it was off-peak. Breakfast was fantastic and room service very good, though pricey. All in all, very good but not excellent.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1159,"Unbelievable service, location, and great wifi",50,March 2015,"Simply wonderful hotel! Excellent service, fantastic location on beachfront near cafes, restaurants, bars, shops, and spas in Seminyak. Free wifi works very well, unlike other places. Staff was superb. Spoke excellent English, booked reservations for us, and provided us with everything we needed. If you don't have bugspray, they have it, if you need a sarong, they have it, if you need a car and driver, they will arrange for you. Very relaxing. The hotel manager was always present and there was always a drink offered to me wherever I went in the hotel. Good music selection on the in-house ipod. Thank you for a beautiful experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1160,Legian - Step and you have arrived ........,50,February 2015,"My wife and I stayed five nights at this Hotel recently to celebrate our Anniversary, having stayed 3 nights at its sister hotel Chedi Club in Ubud beforehand. What an amazing treat!

We were welcomed by the GM Kevin and his staff and feted like royalty - every minute right to the end. The room (admittedly it was de luxe) was sumptuous with an amazing sea view, tastefully furnished and have all the mod cons you can dream of. We were treated to a lovely Anniversary cake and a chilled bottle of bubbly - how thoughtful!

We wanted a bit of rest, some sun and fine dining. The hotel arranged for everything including free wi-fi, all whims, every wish - no trouble. The staff were most courteous and helpful and made us feel at home immediately. To name any particular staff for commendation would be unfair on the rest as WITHOUT EXCEPTION, every one of them quite clearly displayed a genuine wish to please and make out life comfortable. Catering in the hotel was bliss and the massage, a welcome relief!

The proximity to the beach, the very pretty local shops (we called it Sloan Street!) and an vast array of amazing eating places in the vicinity makes this hotel a must-visit abode. Talk about location, location, location, this one is to die for!

We had an army of staff to bid us farewell, and guess what - Kevin took the trouble to see us off, beaming with a smile as is his want! Thank you guys, you are real gems.

Can't wait to come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1161,Top notch!,50,March 2015,"I've stayed at this hotel from 2nd to 6th of March.
From beginning on arrival, the check process was smooth, the staff name Eka was very friendly.
I was asking so many questions, and seems that she is more than happy to explain all the questions.
After the check in process was done, she guided me to my suite.
Wasn't near the lobby area, but I never feel it far as this is ""adventure"".
She open the suite and allowed me to step inside first.
I was amazed with the suite size (it was one bed room suite), and the amenities provides was fine.
The hotel staff explain about the suite facilities, I was just too excited to explore the resort. And she also offered me to a short resort tour.
The suite's balcony is huge! I can relax the whole day in the suite...! Who needs to go out (I was thinking that way).
The breakfast restaurant staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant next to the pool also nice.
Everyone knows my name!
Even without spelling my suite number!
5 days of staying is just too short... This property and it's staff is a sample have created a memorable holiday to me and my friends",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1162,laid back break,40,February 2015,"excellent hotel, excellent anticipatory service. Property a bit tired and needs a bit of improvement generally but lovely nonetheless. Worth staying for the service alone. Grouses: not enough f&B outlets, only one restaurant. The breakfast needs perking up. The two seaside bars lack character and could do with some modernizing and then could be quite amazing. the corridor behind the kitchen is quite hot.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

Excellent service - staff go above and beyond expectations and nothing is too much trouble. We were greeted personally by the manager, by name, at our breakfast on the first morning. Excellent breakfast. Excellent everything. We stayed in a ground floor suite and it was just above and beyond our expectations as avid travellers. Yoga classes and gym are great. Spa was nice, but was being renovated at the time. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1165,Fantastic World Class Resort,50,February 2015,"We just spent a most wonderful 4 days there over the Chinese New Year holiday. We have stayed in many First Class resorts around the world including the Burj Al Arab in Dubai and the Dorchester in London. The Legian was every bit as nice as any place we have ever stayed, and the service was probably the best we had ever seen, anywhere!

The hotel is truly blessed to have a manager like Kevin Abramowicz. He not only welcomed us but we saw him constantly during our stay. After running on the beach early in the morning I came back to find him inspecting the beach furniture. He was everywhere and his diligence showed as his staff was second to none.

The food and drinks were great and we enjoyed our time in both the bars and restaurant. The room was clean, well kept, modern, with every attention to detail. We loved our special treats that were provided every evening. The number of special things they did for us is endless, and we are grateful!

Thank you so much for everything. We have had an internal rule that we never stay the same place twice. We like to try out new things and have new experiences in new places. However, the Legian may cause us to break that rule. We loved it there and will certainly be back.

Thank you Kevin and your staff for everything.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1166,A leading hotel of the world? I can see why.,50,February 2015,"The Legian is a damn fine establishment. While the location, facilities and services are exemplary, what really stood out for us was the incredible staff and service. The experience is personalised and the attention to detail is astounding. Stay here and you shouldn't be disappointed.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1167,Impeccable Service,50,February 2015,"It was my first time at the Legian and honestly, I expected the usual haughtiness and pomp that are synonymous with luxury hotels that I have stayed at in the past. But I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel staff felt genuine and warm and it felt like you weren't judged based on how you presented. The GM, Mr Abramowicz, was very welcoming without being intrusive.

We stayed there for our belated honeymoon and were welcomed to the room with a nice chocolate cake and champagne, they even upgraded our room for us.

When my wife said she wanted to buy the hair dryer they provided in the room, I was skeptical that she would be able to but we thought we'd try anyway. They got back to us and said that they had spares so they could sell one to us and she was delighted.

The thoughtful service and promptness was excellent. Being able to have breakfast or tea in room or at their restaurant was a nice touch. Everyone at the hotel was attentive and quick to come to your service with a warm smile. Probably one of the best experiences I've had in a long while.

Close proximity to the airport, beach, town area, good restaurants and spas, along with their excellent service and well-kept surroundings, even with their steep price point, it is a hotel stay worth experiencing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1168,Excellent Service & Comfortable,50,February 2015,"It is our first time to stay The Legian Bali, and the hotel impressed us so much, staff service is excellent, they always put their smile on their face, room is clean, place is quiet, then we can relax during our stay, we are looking forward to stay again if we come next year!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1169,Luxury Honeymoon,50,February 2015,"We just got back from our stay at The Legian for our honeymoon for 6 nights, and couldn't have asked for a better hotel, more welcoming staff, or a more relaxing stay.

We stayed in a Studio Suite, and has asked for a room on the top floor so we could get a higher view of the ocean. We were greeted by the Executive Assistant Manager, Rohaan Chandra, on check-in, which we appreciated. Check in was smooth and seamless in the lounge area. As it was our honeymoon, we were greeted with a bottle of french champagne and honeymoon cake on arrival in our room, which made everything even more special. The room had a fantastic view of the ocean, and we had the sounds of the ocean all day and night which were extremely soothing.

Breakfasts were the best I've had in Bali. Very relaxing with a great view, and ordering off the menu was much better than having to deal with the crowded buffets you have to deal with in most other hotels. There was still the benefits of a buffet for items like fresh fruits, juices, pastries, cheeses etc, which was fantastic.

The pool area was our favourite, we spent most days by the pool where the staff knew us by name. The staff were always so helpful in moving umbrellas around all day to ensure you had shade if you wanted it. They also provide fresh water and face mist, with special treats during the day like sorbets. There's also complimentary afternoon tea, plus complimentary treats left in your room each night at turn down service.

We had dinner at the restaurant one night which was fantastic, great service, view and food.

We also met the General Manager, and thought it was great we could see him out on the floor of the hotel, meeting guests, checking in, checking breakfast was running smoothly etc. He also saw us off on our last day as we departed the hotel for the airport, which was a lovely touch.

Keep up the fantastic work, we can't wait to stay again.
Emma & Adrian Donald",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1170,Fantastic hotel,50,May 2014,"This is a fantastic hotel.

The atmosphere was very peaceful and tranquil. Rooms are huge with a separate sitting/dining area. The bathroom was spacious with twin basins and a bath and shower (the only small complaint is that the lighting in the bathroom is very dark - but this was not a major problem)

All staff that we met were very polite and friendly and could not do enough to help.

Food was good. We ate in the hotel a couple of nights but as it is so easy to walk into Seminyak in the evening we usually went out to eat.

The pool area was beautiful - three separate pools overlooking the beach.

The beach was clean and sandy but unfortunately too rough for swimming whilst we were there (we knew before we arrived that this might happen).

A lovely relaxing holiday - we will be back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1171,The ultimate attention to the smallest details,50,February 2015,"We spent four nights at The Legian. Mr. Kevin Abramowicz, the General Manager, and his all staff, look at the smallest details to make your stay the ultimate experience.
Just one example in a million: they have wifi in the cars they use for transportation of guests, and the wifi code is the same as in your room, so you have seemless connection between room and car!
Warmly recommended....",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1172,Simply the best,50,March 2014,"The Legian, Bali has been the best hotel we stayed in as a couple during a lot of travelling, including staying at other GHM hotels and the times (like this) where we wanted to splash out on a little extra luxury. There was no single thing that made this such an amazing experience but, rather, the combination of attention to detail, quality food, excellent service, fantastic room, lovely pool, and the sheer feeling of being pampered after a few months of travelling around Asia.

I can appreciate families may not find this the best location in Bali or the best options for children, but that was not in our requirements at that time. It is simply not true to rate this hotel Poor or Terrible. If you are not snooty or overdosed in constant 5-star hotel experiences, you should find Legian a truly wonderful experience. Thank you Legian for our memories.

Travelled 2011.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1173,Join the Family,50,January 2015,"You go to a distant destination and family picks you up from the airport. Not uncommon is it. You leave for home and family does the same takes you back to the airport right up to immigration.
That's how you get treated at the Legian....you are part of a family from the moment you leave immigration to the time you depart. We left at 4.00am. And the hotel is there for you, all the way 24hrs a day.
The service here is probably the best we have experienced worldwide. Nothing is too much trouble. This is a boutique hotel mostly for adults. If you have children then you probably need to do some research on what you expect from the hotel .. Email and ask.

My wife was unwell upon arrival and took a few days to recover.
The hotel doctor provided personal in room service at a moderate price...he was tired of Bali Belly and welcomed a new challenge such as blocked ear drums and congestion.
Chef Luke caught hold of this on the grape vine and personally offerred to prepare chicken broth for the soul.

We tried some of the better known restaurants in Seminyak, but at the end of the day the food at the Hotel was equally awesome thanks to Chef Luke. You just don't know it until you go out and compare. And certainly no more expensive. Seafood salad awesome ditto jumbo prawns.

We have never previously been welcomed upon arrival by the Manager of the Hotel..thank you Kevin. The staff are fantastic from A to Z without mentioning names. They are all exceptional.

So why did we come here? Well it was for our 25th wedding anniversary and we came for a week. Nothing but the best when you are in the senior years of your life. Of course you let the Hotel know and they were very gracious and very kind in celebrating it with us.

This Hotel soundly deserves to be number 1 in Bali. Give it a try.
From us it is highly recommended.
Looking forward to next time.......",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1174,Outstanding,50,January 2015,"If your thinking about booking the Legian STOP, thinking about it and make your booking ASAP. My husband and I were continually impressed at the attention to detail. We have stayed at 5 star hotels else where in the world, but this was our first at a Leading Hotel of The World, a title the Legian well deserves.
The hotel and grounds are very luxurious. Staff impeccable, addressing us by name each and every time we saw them. I'm a swimmer. The pools (3) are divine. In room dining was delicious. Eating outside on our vast balcony taking in the view was superb and intimate. We will definitely be back and have every intention of spreading the word of how Outstanding the Legian is. I do feel it starts at the top so sincerest congratulations to The hotels manager Mr Kevin Abramowicz.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1175,Excellent Family Holiday,50,January 2015,"Cant recommend this place highly enough. Near everything, Great Pool. fantastic Service. We travelled with 2 kids and took the 2 bed suite. It was perfection from the moment that we arrived.
We had some travel concerns given the smart traveller travel warnings - but the security at the hotel is great. One of the kids got sick and the doctor was there in 10 mins because the clinic is downstairs. Fixed him up in 24 hours. the service is second to none. Don't stay anywhere else!
The only comment i would make is that the kids club is more of a kids get together and do something rather than a kids club. We did a surf lesson for the kids at Rip curl which was excellent and we did the Bali safari which was good - but don't eat anything there...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1176,A wonderful trip to paradise!,50,January 2015,"Everything was perfect at the Legian Bali. We spent 4 nights and couldn't have been more impressed with everything the hotel had to offer. Top notch facilities, staff, and grounds. A wonderful honeymoon experience!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1177,"Spendy, but worth it",50,January 2015,"This hotel had everything: a prime beachfront location, three (tiered) infinity pools, a spa, a restaurant, complimentary beachside yoga, and lovely suites. The service was impeccable, and the beachside foot massages (by their own spa staff) were fabulous. The beach, unfortunately, was quite dirty, but that was not the hotel's fault (the manager told us it was because a recent storm washed a lot of trash onto the beach, and we could see that people were cleaning it every day.) Fortunately, the lounges beachside featured a view OVER the trash!

Everything during our 5 night stay was perfect, except for one activity (off-site) which the hotel concierge booked for us (at Bali Horseback Adventures - I'm hoping they won't use this vendor in the future!).

This hotel is quite near many good restaurants, as well, such as Urchin and Bambu.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1178,Dangerous for kids,10,January 2015,"We stayed here with our daughter. The kids activity are very disappointed and only from 1 to 4 pm in the afternoon not of any interest for her as she is sleeping from 1 to 3 pm and the activities are not suitable for toddlers. They even have no toys for her or and no bathing supplies were provided in the room for her. Her bed was also very outdated and not conform modern standards as you may expected these days.

The baby chairs they have are very very dangerous. My daugther fell out of it because there was no way to settle her properly in the chair, she could just climb out. No way you would have such a baby chair in your home.

The hotel is also very outdated and need some renovation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1179,Best Hotel in The World,50,February 2014,"The private beach alone makes this hotel worth the cost. I still think of the quality of the water. It was really beautiful, gentle. You could go out and play in the waves, and they were big but not rough. Then the waves settled down regularly, and you could swim freestyle back and forth. The service out on the beach was great--they do everything. And the rooms are stylish, comfortable and perfectly designed and appointed. I am always trying to get back there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1180,Pure Luxury,50,May 2014,"My family have stayed at The Legian numerous times this was my first time staying there along with my frequent visitor In-Laws, this place is amazing from Kevin greeting ""The London"" family back, to the all the staff excellent and professional service. The 2 Bedroom suite lovely comfortable one of my favourite times was watching sunset from our balcony drinking champagne with the luscious green grounds that surround made this hotel one of the best I have stayed in Bali (and we have been going yearly to Bali for 10 years).

Unfortunately the down side is I can no longer stay anywhere else in Bali and when I do stay somewhere else I find myself thinking about this place. I am looking forward to coming back this year with my first child and indulging in some luxury.

Kevin you run a tight and an amazing ship you should be commended for your excellence along with your excellent team.

Thank You .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1181,excellent hotel with excellent service,50,December 2014,"My family of five (two adult and three kids) stay 5 nights in legian (from Dec.30th, 2014 to Jan.4th) in a two bedroom suite. Althought the hardware of this hotel is not the most luxuary. The service of this hotel is really excellent. The two bedroom suite is also very comfortable. It let my family to feel very comfortable to stay in the hotel.
The hotel has two restaurants. We have dinner in both of them. We have also requested in-room lunch service. All of them is very good. The food is delicious.
The hotel provide legian monkey as welcome gift to kids. The hotel also arrange staff to play with kids during day time so that my wife and I can enjoy spa and other activity.
My kids like to play wth staffs very much. They have made painted masks. The room service staffs have also helpped to put painted masks on legian monkey which make my kids very happy.
My airplane leave at 6:00pm. The hotel allows me to stay in my suite till 3:00pm so that my kids can have a good sleep before they leave.
The only pity is Dec and Jan are raining month in Bali. The beach will have a lot of rubbish after heavy rain even staffs from hotel have been kept on cleaning the beach. I have heard that the beach will be very clean except Dec.and Jan.
In summary, I highly recomend legian bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1182,"Great location, great hotel",50,December 2014,"I stayed at the Legian Bali for a vacation this past month. It was an amazing experience. The facility, the view, and the bedroom are all amazing. We really enjoyed our stay. We would definitely be staying here again in the future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1183,Amazing service!!!,50,March 2014,"I stayed the Legian Bali this spring with my family. It was our fourth times to visit Bali. We stayed nice hotel every time but I think the Legian Bali is my best hotel ever. I love their service very much. First, the staff always remembered our name and caled with the name. Also, the room was very comfortable. Especially I like nice and big bath tab. There was a bath salt, so I could enjoy salt bath. Furthermore, they provided one hour morning yoga class. We did yoga outside and it made me feel amazing. Thank you so much.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1184,Great Stay,50,January 2015,"My family of four (two adult children) stayed at The Legian for 4 nights, and I must say that this was one of the finest hotel experiences that we have ever enjoyed. We were provided a beautiful two bedroom suite with a balcony overlooking the beach. The facility has a large infinity pool next to a great sandy beach (albeit rough surf). We were provided impeccable service (everyone in the hotel staff seemed to know my name) in teh restaurant and bars (poolside). The restaurant had extensive breakfast options with both Western and Asian cuisine (particularly good Eggs Benedict). Room service was prompt. Housekeeping was almost too prompt (like we went to breakfast at 8am and when we came back, attendants were already in our room cleaning). The General Manager personally greeted us twice (once at poolside and once on departure). My daughter reported that she had a lovely luxurious treatment /massage at the spa. My wife participated in the daily yoga class beachside, and and I found workout facilities to be good with a reasonable variety of weight and cardio machines (although I wish they had a cardio rowing machine). The location is near a number of restaurant and nightlife options. We really enjoyed the stay. Thanks to all the staff for helping make our Bali visit so memorable.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1185,Left 'a bad taste in my mouth!',30,January 2015,"I received four requests from the Legian regarding, amongst other things
• Preferences (if any)
• Dietary program (if any)
I wrote as requested 'I am vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater... He eats no fish. He will not eat spicy food at all'
On arrival there was one, ONLY ONE, dish with several small bite size finger food, some uncut fruit and a bottle of wine (which we didn't drink) already nicely laid out on our coffee table.
How I wish I had taken a photo!
On our single rectangle dish was a square of raw tuna, a square of bread with cheese, one square of ham and two tiny fresh rice vegetable spring rolls (not fried) Yummy, that's just what I like!
I informed the butler that my husband would not eat the bits as there was fish on the same plate!
I asked if the rolls were vegetarian? Yes. Good then as we won't eat anything else. Could I please have more 'vegetarian' rice fresh spring rolls with some sweet and sour sauce, as I was very hungry. My husband said he was happy to eat some fruit.
Sometime later, our butler returned with delicious spring rolls which he put onto our garden table.
They were small but so good I went inside to get the other two original rolls.
When I bit into it, I was horrified to find chicken in it!
Don't waste your time filling in the form 'to make your stay perfect' as The Deputy GM, and indeed the GM too, insisted that we had two dishes on arrival, one for a meat eater and one vegetarian! I think a visit to a culinary school may not go amiss!
Yes, they are both correct that I got a second dish, but unfortunately, I ate the welcome spring roll AFTER I ate the ones I requested in person to the butler.
We had just got off a Crystal cruise where the requests and service were impeccable.
My experience left a 'bad taste in my mouth' literally, particularly as I was dismissed by both mangers as a liar!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1186,"Exceeding our expectations. Thank you, the Legian!",50,January 2015,"As I am also a researcher on corporate communication, we talk about the importance of and the outcome of engaging internal and external stakeholders. The success of the Legian definitely reflects this point. The Legian not only provides impeccable services but also engages with the staff and guests very well.

We chose the Legian Bali because we have been staying at its sister property in Ubud, the Chedi Club, each time when we visited Bali. This time, in addition to staying in the Chedi Club for a few nights, we decided to spend some time in the Legian for our sea-side accommodation. To summarize the experience of our stay, it is as what I put on the title of this review -- exceeding our expectations. I think the GHM Group should be congratulated for providing wonderful (and perfect) accommodations with impeccable services to guests.

We appreciate very much the visible leadership of the hotel. The General Manager, Mr. Kevin Abramovicz, apparently cares a lot about the hotel and the guests. He would stop by to chat with guests and engaged in real conversations. He is multilingual -- talking with my husband in German and English with me. He also listened careful what we told him and responded. We believe that his leadership formed a great team and each member of the team coordinated well according to his or her responsibilities. The duty manager, Ngakan, showed us that he not only did what guests said but also went extra miles to help us. I could not thank him more. When we requested to change to another room, he really did all he could and more than what we asked him. For this, we really thank him for making our stay perfect!! We also appreciate the manager in the restaurant, Eddie, and the executive chef, Luke, who helped make my husband's birthday dinner there a really unforgettable and enjoyable time. By talking with the different staffs here, we feel them enjoy working at the Legian because of the great management here.

Another kudos to the Legian: this is the first hotel, among all those we’ve stayed in Bali, that we had all meals in the hotel. Each dish we ordered, either just only a club sandwich or an in-room Rijsttafel dining, the restaurant in the Legian could always prepared it just right. We always enjoyed each dish we ordered.

The three tiered infinity pools were also amazing. My husband and I went there a couple of times. Though it was really windy during our stay, the staff there was experienced in helping set up the day bed, providing towels, and arranging our drinks and snacks well. They all did so with smiles.

I will not spend time talking about our suite here -- we agree all the positive reviews from other reviewers on Tripadvisor.

Even though, because of the strong wind and the waves were so rough at the sea, we were unable to swim in the sea. This is, however, the first time I feel so happy and really satisfied in staying in a seaside hotel in Bali. We will definitely return. And -- we have already highly recommended this hotel to our family and friends!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1187,A wonderful experience,50,January 2015,"We stayed at The Legian at the recommendation of a family member. Although very costly I am glad we did it. Everything is done beautifully and you really are treated like royalty. Lots of little surprises along the way including daily sweet treats left in the room, little messages on the bed and afternoon tea. We were invited to enjoy complementary cocktails and canapé with management, which was also enjoyable. The beauty products are gorgeous also (imported I believe). We celebrated our wedding anniversary at their outstanding restaurant and were treated with a gift from management - a bottle of champagne! I sincerely thank the team at The Legian for making our stay so special. Although we were a larger family than what The Legian generally caters to, they made us feel welcome and helped us enjoy our family time in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1188,Paradise every day,50,December 2014,"I stayed here for the 3rd time over Xmas and the Legian didn't disappoint.

It's definitely not a party hotel so don't expect this, but it is a 5 mins drive to all the cool bars, beach clubs and eateries in Seminyak and some a 5 min walk - if that's what you want. it is so luxurious and tranquil the worst thing about this hotel is having to leave.
Every hotel team member knows your name and you feel like you're coming home to your own villa on the beach front. The hotel was In excellent condition as always and the new touches like included mini bar, snacks and the bathroom Aqua d Parma products are fantastic. The rooms are amazing, large all beach facing, comfiest beds and softest towels. I was fortunate to have been upgraded - phenomenal and a beautiful surprise.

The food and bar selection is awesome, and service by all staff impeccable. The gym is pretty good also with a lot of really great machines so thus was much appreciated.

I highly recommend the extra $$ it costs as there is nothing better, prettier, more relaxing, more welcoming or more amazing that I have seen in this location. It's worth every sent and you'll return again and again.

Thanks again Kevin and your team for a fantastic stay. See you hopefully in 6 months",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1189,Perfection,50,January 2015,"I have not previously written a review on trip advisor, I have not felt the need/been overwhelmed to do so until now.

I will keep it brief: the 5 days spent at this hotel were the most relaxing, luxurious and indulgent 5 days I've spent anywhere. I travel a lot for work and am accustomed to luxury hotels but the surrounds and the service at The Legian are like nothing I've experienced anywhere in the world. After arriving late, by 8am the next morning we were greeted by name by all staff and this was consistent throughout our stay.

I can't fault a single thing. The GM Kevin was very visible and friendly and personally farewelled us on our departure.

Highly recommend for a romantic and rejuvenating holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1190,Why stay elsewhere?,50,January 2015,"This was our second trip to Bali and we again stayed at the Legian having enjoyed it so much before. We were not disappointed - friendly, welcoming service that was always smoothly efficient no matter what the request; beautiful pool and surrounding gardens; delightful room with fantastic views of the beach, especially at sunset; great food and wine. Being so close to the busy shops and restaurants in Seminyak was an added bonus (some only a short stroll along the beach away) as was the absolute tranquillity inside the hotel after venturing out. We will definitely be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1191,Best honeymoon!,50,January 2015,"A great hotel with a great staff! A spacious room, very comfortable with a great ocean view, own terrace with sunbeds, luxurious cosmetics, nespresso coffee, daily fresh fruits and tasty complements, Bose doc station providing fantastic music sound in the room, blue-ray film collection at the request. Still the greatest value is the staff - so careful and friendly! Special thanks to Darma with whom we travelled around Bali the whole day long and who provided us with a lot of interesting information. Everything was exceptional! Thank You, The Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1192,Nothing to Fault Here,50,January 2015,"Having never been to Bali before, I picked this hotel because of it's #1 rating on Tripadvisor. Easy to see how it got it's rating.

Great holiday, thanks to all the staff who made it so & somehow even organized no rain for the whole week!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1193,Peace and tranquility,50,January 2015,"What a wonderful place. Beachfront hotel with superb gardens and excellent facilities. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for them. We had a ground floor mini suite facing the beach. Extremely comfortable with everything you need for your stay. There was a nice little terrace area with a table and chairs and a separate terrace with sunloungers.
The food was excellent with a huge choice for breakfast and a very good menu for evening dinner. Afternoon tea was a little disappointing but nowhere near enough to take anything away from this brilliant hotel.
Felt very cosseted and looked after by all of the staff. If you are visiting Bali I would strongly recommend staying here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1194,spot on !,50,December 2014,"My wife and i had the privilege to have a 10 night stay in the club at Legian. What an refreshing experience. I have seen quite a lot of luxury hotels so far, but this was by far the best experience. It all starts when you are picked up by a chauffeur from the hotel and it ends when someone from the hotel helps you checking in on your flight out. Amazing !. In between were 10 fantastic days. The Club villas are wonderfull. Yoni was more a Personal Assistant then a butler....thnx Yoni !... Management (thnx Kevin !) is excellent with a great eye for detail. Fireworks on the beach at 00.00 on the 31st. Great party as well. Can't think of anything i would change. Besides of the traffic in Seminyak, but i guess that is out of control of the hotel :-)

1195,Amazing Service at The Club at The Legian,50,January 2015,"We are staying at The Club at Legian from 7th till 11th Jan. The service is outstanding both at The Club as well as The Legian. The staff at The Club lounge took very good care of us, making sure that we are comfortable as well as ferrying us around within the Seminyak area. The dining recommendations were awesome. The level of hospitality is amazing . We are really enjoying our stay and felt that we needed to write this review before we left this oasis.
The villa (villa 8) is very nice. Special thanks to Toni and all staff at the club lounge for making this stay such a memorable one for my hubby and I. We both agreed that this was by far the most relaxing anniversary trip we have had. We will definitely return with our family in the near future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1196,The best place to stay in the area!,50,December 2014,"We spent a week at the legian over NYE. What an awesome hotel. The service is excellent, the breakfast is good and so is the other food, and the grounds and our room was beautiful. The small things that the staff does like know our names and seeing managers on site making sure their guests are enjoying their vacation make a huge difference. For my husband and I, there were no negatives to this hotel. We loved having a huge suite with two bedrooms and two bathrooms as I hate to share a bathroom in usual small hotel rooms!

Side note- during the time we were there, the beach was full of trash and wood. Really upsetting to see, but it is cleaned up as best as can be done so guests from hotel do not have to see as much trash as other parts of the beach.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1197,I did not want to go home,50,October 2014,"Second time we have stayed at the Legian and there is a very good reason we will be back again this year..it is simply perfect, the location, service, food, beach, pool area in fact everything about this hotel is great. On our last visit we surprised our Godson and his Girlfriend by taking them there for a break in between a 2 week holiday they were having with us in Hong Kong. When we arrived we learnt we had been upgraded to the Penthouse on the first floor. It turned out this room was bigger than most peoples apartments with 2 double bedrooms, bathrooms, a kitchen, lounge area, an outside terrace, two pagodas under which you could lounge and read your book, the room came with our very own Butler who took really good care of us which included mastering the best vodka and tonic..finally the sunset from the penthouse was breathtaking. Food was some of the best I have had in Bali, cooked and served with a smile...I challenge anyone not to like this hotel. I cried when it was time to go home, we will be back again in October and cannot wait. Well done Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1198,Wonderful hotel,50,January 2015,Its an amazing hotel. Everything was very very nice. We stayed in the villa with a private pool for 3 nights. The service was more than good you feel like you are the queen in the kingdom. The spa was a different scenario😍😍 Unforgettable nights at this fabulous hotel.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1199,My favorite Bali hotel,50,December 2014,"I've stayed at The Legian many times and it just keeps getting better. My last visit was for 5 nights with my husband and daughter. We had a deluxe one bedroom suite. There where a few small changes - the beds were more comfortable, blinds had been added to the bedroom to make it darker in the morning, the mini bar soft drinks and snacks were complimentary, there were extra mirrors in the bathroom. This hotel tries to get everything perfect for your stay. The food is amazing - the breakfast is the best I've had in Bali and I've stayed at many hotels. The service is excellent and not 'in your face' or 'try too hard'. I would recommend using the hotel transfers both ways - you are escorted all the way to the departure gate. Everything The Legian does is exceptional.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1200,A 5* Break!,50,December 2014,"We stayed for 4 nights over Xmas and it was a pleasure to be guest at The Legian.
The rooms were spacious, facilities very clean and the staff were wonderful. Food and drinks available were very good, and we enjoyed the Indonesian Banquet on Xmas Day.
The hotel has a great beachfront location and is well located in Seminyak to visit beach bars and restaurants by foot, taxi or moped.
The price is higher than average in the area but it represents great value based on the service we received and how well we were looked after.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1201,"6 years later, still the best place to stay",50,January 2015,"This is our 4th stay at Legian Club Villas. It has been 7 years since we first stayed here, and the service, food, staff & amenities are still exceptional. They really know how to look after you - they have gone above and beyond our needs. Thank you! We'll be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1202,A great place to stay while in Bali.,50,January 2015,"What makes this Hotel a great place to stay in Bali,are the staff and the location.
But more important are the attention to every single details,from the moment you arrive at the airport,greeted by Pak Wayan,who waited for hours for my very late arrival,past midnight.In the car that transport you to the Hotel,the speedy check in.in fact there was no check in at all,because they know you are tired at this time of the night.And in the room,fresh flowers and a basket of fresh fruits with a personal note from the general manager.In the morning at the restaurant,Ibu Winarthi,always remembers what you like to have for breakfast.At the spa,Pak Eka with his magic hands knew how to take away your fatigue.Later at the pool,they know which spot you would like to be to enjoy the sun,the dramatic waves,which the beach is known for...and for the beautiful sunset.
Pak Chandra always take the time to say hello,no matter how busy he must have been.
The location,just 45 minutes drive from the airport, is close to all the best restaurants in the island,the interesting shops,the hot spots and easy to get taxis.
Just before you leave,Pak Agung is always ready to pack every thing that has to be specially pack,in my case,two large Garuda sculptures,which arrives safely and intact!
Finally,after you check out,the General Manager, Mr Kevin J Abramovicz thanks you and accompanied you to your car to bid you farewell.
No,that is not final......at the airport,again,you are met by Pak wayan who help you check in at the airline counter.
Thank you The Legian Hotel for making my stay memorable to welcome the New Year ,Happy 2015.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1203,Where else but The Legian,50,November 2014,"We stayed at The Legian for 3 nights from November 18-21. This is our third time here, and our last stay was some 10 years ago. Naturally I was slightly concerned about how the property had aged in the last decade. All our concerns were laid to rest the moment we checked into the hotel. The check-in formalities done, we were greeted by the personable GM, Kevin Abrahamowicz who asked if we were going to wait another 10 years before returning to The Legian! Truth be told, I'll be back in a heartbeat. Here's why:

This is by far the best of the three classic luxury hotels along Seminyak. We have stayed at The Oberoi Bali several times and twice at The Samaya, so this review is no idle boast based on hearsay. I thought the service at The Oberoi was incredible, but I feel that The Legian has raised the bar to an all-new high. Nothing was too difficult for the gracious and well-trained staff and we were greeted by smiles everywhere we went. Pering the pool attendant was extremely helpful as was Tin, the receptionist at the fitness centre. After a workout at the gym one morning I'd forgotten that I had left my room key with my wife at the pool. I was going to walk back to the pool to get the key but Tin insisted that she'd save me the bother and sent an attendant by the name of Eka to look for my wife. I am not sure how Eka found my wife but he did and came back with my room key within minutes. Like I said, the service is just incredible.

We were upgraded to an executive suite, but to be honest we would have been equally happy staying at the entry-level studio suite. There are black-out shades over the wooden blinds where none had existed before, and you would be very hard-pressed to tell that this is a hotel that is nearly two decades old (I think). The suites are capacious and equipped with all the mod cons you need; the location and views are spectacular; the breakfast spread is decadent; the facilities, including fitness centre and swimming pool, are superb; and the service is (oh, have I mentioned that already?) is faultless.

My only quibble is the lack of shaded bales (thatched pavilions) to chill by the beach. I wish The Legian would build a few more of these.

The next time we return to Bali, it's definitely The Legian, and nothing else. If you paying top dollar, why settle for anything less than perfection?",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1204,Loved loved loved this place,50,June 2014,"We stayed at the Legian on the first 3 nights of a two week holiday in Bali and to be honest this was not the hotel that we were most looking forward to staying at.... but how wrong we were. It is not just that this is a brilliant hotel, in a fantastic location, with great facilities and wonderful food.... it is the people and the attention to detail which raised this already fantastic hotel to a stellar level for us.

We arranged to be met at the airport and our driver moved us quickly through the complicated arrival process and whisked us away to the Legian. A smooth and personalised check in, quick tour and orientation to the hotel and then off to our room.

Our room was beautiful - separate bedroom and sitting room with dining area - the most amazing balcony with a day bed overlooking the sea - a separate ""guest"" toilet and a kitchen. On arrival complimentary canapés were waiting for us in the room.

The kitchen was stocked with complimentary water and soft drinks and crisps/nuts/cookies and a nespresso machine. All of this was restocked twice daily. Fresh fruit was left daily. Every evening a delicious complimentary chocolate was left on the dining table with a little note explaining what it was.

The bedroom had a huge four poster bed with muslin curtains. Beautifully comfortable. The bathroom was wonderful, fantastic shower, huge bath which we did not use, really good quality toiletries which were also regularly restocked. A proper hairdryer! The only slight niggle was that the lighting was too ""mood"" and not great for a girl to do her make up by.

The hotel provides an in room iPod which has been stocked with thousands of tracks. What a simple but brilliant idea. IPod chargers are also provided in rooms

Breakfast was a complete feast. Buffet, American, cooked by request, Indonesian - they covered everything - all fresh and great quality. Great fresh juices, cereals, yogurts, coffee - and such lovely servers.

The pool areas are very well maintained, the beach beautiful. Someone will help you find the area that you want to be seated in. They will then bring you towels, water, a face spray, will generally try to accommodate your every whim! Complimentary fruit, sorbet, juices are brought around at regular intervals. There is a very clear policy that people cannot ""bag"" chairs. In the afternoon complimentary afternoon tea and cakes are served.

There are a couple of bars in the area of the pool which serve fabulous cocktails.

The hotel staff were all fantastic. Friendly, smiley, helpful, attentive - and everyone seemed to know your name! We decided there was either an elaborate wireless system which tracked us through the hotel or a board with photos and names of all the guests on it!

We had the most exquisite three days here and did not want to leave. The only saving grace was that we were going to the Legian's sister hotel, the Chedi Club, next. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, our stay was magical and memorable. We are already planning our next trip and this time the Legian will be the hotel we are most looking forward to staying at.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1205,A wonderful New Years Eve - thank you!,50,December 2014,"At some point during the night of the 30th and the day of 31st the entrance, dining area and pool area was transformed into a Venice themed (including a replica of the Bridge of Sighs over the swimming pool) masked ball with several world class Opera singers providing an even deeper ""Italian/Venetian"" experience. All the hotel team (not staff - this is a wonderful team inspired family) were dressed in 18th century Venetian carnival costume entertained and went about their responsibilities with passion and clear enjoyment. No thought was missed including special air conditioning brought in to make the environment feel like a balmy summer night. The finale was a magnificent firework display on the beach. On the 1st January 2015 The Legian is, ever more so, exuding a happy warm environment with all guests acknowledging each other and talking about the evening to friends new and old.

This is a wonderful hotel with people who are passionate for their profession and the management are responsible for running what is one of the worlds finest, warm and inviting hotel. Thank you to The Legian for giving us new friends and memories that will last forever.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1206,Paradise,50,December 2014,"I cannot think of anything we are not happy about here.
For a relaxing holidays with our two young kids, this is the best place we couldpossibly have stayed. Staff is very friendly, pleasant and helpful. Juices, coffee, cocktails, fruits, snacks are comprementory. Pools and the villa are very clean. We really had time here and probably will come back next time.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1207,Sheer luxury and perfect seaviews,50,December 2014,"The atmosphere is calm and laid back; the service is meticulous. The sound of the waves lapping the beach provides a perfect soundtrack for laying around the beach bar or pools. The rooms are Balinese style - comfort and space with great amenities. The restaurants are gourmet - lots of fresh, local produce and are overlooking the beach. This is the hotel for the perfect relaxing holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1208,The best hotel I have ever experienced,50,November 2014,"My wife and I spent the last few nights of our honeymoon at The Legian towards the end of November.

The hotel is of a classic, formal design. The room we had was a studio suite and was very large. The pool area is lovely with a three tiered infinity pool offering great views of the ocean. Needless to say, the hotel and the grounds are very high quality.

Where this hotel goes from great to truly excellent in my opinion is the service. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by the assistant manager Mr Chandra, who would catch up with us at various points throughout our stay to make sure things were ok. Everyone seemed to know our name. Everyone was attentive, friendly and so genuine. It wasn't just the level of service but the delivery that was spot on.

Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. On the last day our flight didn't leave until 10pm that evening. We were offered complimentary use of our room and afternoon tea until we were ready to leave.

I travel fairly extensively. The service here and the feeling you get when staying are on a different level to what I have previously experienced. I hope someday to return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1209,Cannot be beaten!,50,December 2014,"Just returned from our second stay at The Club at the Legian, and once again, this hotel has reaffirmed itself as our favourite in the world. The other reviews speak for themselves and I can't add much more, except to stay that we've never felt so welcome, so looked after and amongst such genuine staff as here. The level of service, attentiveness and luxury is second to none. I highly recommend the Club villas for the extra details including butler service and private pool, plus the use of a chauffeur driven car which was great for getting around the local area. Our special thanks to the marvellous Eka, our butler who once agin made us feel at home - a very special guy and a credit to the team. Thank you to everyone who helped make our trip so wonderfully memorable - we look forward to seeing you again soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1210,Awesome stay!,50,November 2014,"We stayed at The Club at The Legian and it was great! The villa was huge- it felt like a whole house with a huge plunge pool (almost full sized pool really!). Beautifully decorated and great attention to detail (our butler Chandra knew I liked mangosteins so always made sure there were 2 or 3 in the fruit bowl!). Nothing was too much trouble, Chandra was so friendly and lovely without being overbearing and was happy to organise all outings/ dinners etc. really made the whole stay amazing! Was also great that there was free transfers to the kuta area- they would just call a private car to drive you wherever you wanted to go in the area which was really handy, especially for dinners etc.

The complementary mini bar, free high tea and evening cocktails were amazing as well, really added so much to the stay!

My only suggestion would be it would be great if there was a master switch for all the lights next to the bed- every night we would spend 10 minutes running around trying to figure out where all the light switches are (seriously, there are so many different lights on so many switches!). It does ruin the ambiance a bit when you are relaxed in bed and then both look at each other as to whose turn it is to try to figure out all the lights!

Thoroughly enjoyed our stay,hopefully be back soon! :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1211,Excellent break at the Legian,50,September 2014,"Super hotel and super location. we'd stayed at the chedi previously and after a few days in Thailand with storms on the horizon we shipped ourselves across to Bali and had a fabulous time.
The location of the hotel is superb, and I'd recommend renting on the nice little vespas the hotel has and exploring the area. we went as far out as canguu (to the Deus shop there) but it was great having it to nip around. I'd also recommend a stroll down the beach (heading left as you come out of the hotel onto the beach) down to 'la plancha' for sunset. Great spot.
The hotel has everything you'd expect of a top bali stop but the pools, and slightly raised setting kind of set it apart. Loved the short massages by the pool which were excellent, and the service is excellent as you'd expect. Only fair to say that we found the hotel to be pretty reasonably priced. Especially versus the equivalent hotels we were staying at in Thailand.
I'd definitely recommend as somewhere to stay in Bali. Close enough to everything you need for surfing and sports, but also in a nice boutique shopping area and some super restaurants. Enjoy.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1212,Great location!,40,October 2014,"Upon arriving at the Legian from a wonderful stay at its sister hotel The Chedi we were hoping that our stay here would be just as delightful. We were warmly welcomed and personally greeted by the very friendly Gm Kevin. This was a great start to our 9 night stay at this lovely hotel. We were allocated a room on the ground floor which was a perfect location as it was located very near the pool bar and a lovely quiet corner facing the beach. It was the perfect location for my kids who are aged15 and 10 yr old twins. They could go back to the room and as we could see the room from our loungers & did not have to worry about them going back and forth. Now onto the rooms. Lovely spacious rooms and plenty of space for a family of five to relax in. Housekeeping really kept the rooms immaculate and they were sprayed in the evening to keep those pesky mosquitos at bay. I would definitely recommend a good mosquito repellent if you are one of those unfortunate people who, like me get eaten alive by them. Like the Chedi you also have complimentary afternoon tea here which you can have by the pool or in your room. I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the food at The Legian particularly as we had just experienced the beautiful food at The Chedi. The breakfast was hit and miss with poached eggs( I was asked if I liked them done soft, medium of hard by one of the staff. That's a first!!) being poorly cooked and then things being missed from our order quite a few times. I must say the service in the restaurant was very hit and miss as well. I also found room service food to be inconsistent not only portion size but quality as well.
Now onto the pool area. Lovely and clean and the pool staff wonderful. I would recommend you try the fresh juices (found on the main menu not the small poolside one). As a family who loves juicing we had some delicious fresh juices, try the Bloat Buster a delicious green juice which all the family loved. The hotel is also located in perfect position for all the shops and very near the best spa experience I had in Bali ( The Bodyworks Spa).
I have to say a lovely experience at the Legian but was spoilt at the end of the trip. Upon arriving at the airport for our departure I noticed one of our bags was missing. This has to be the first time this has happened and was made worse by the way the hotel dealt with this. After numerous phone calls ( mobile phone bill was ridiculous) our bag was finally found, which, considering the storage room was not very big I couldn't understand why it took so long to find. This was something I had not expected or ever experienced with a five star hotel and stressed us all out at the end of what was a relaxing holiday. Overall the experience at the Legian was good but not as good as its sister hotel The Chedi.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1213,What a great place,50,August 2014,"We stayed in the club part of the hotel, which is the other side of the street from the main hotel. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of the shops, bars and restaurants of Seminyak, of which there are a lot. You get the best of all worlds: near the shops, use of the hotel facilities and direct access to the beach and then return to your private villa for relaxation The club also has a great swimming pool and its own restauarant. The service, with a personal Butler, is very attentive and discreet. We look forward to returning sometime.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1214,Fantastic Hotel,50,August 2014,"Great hotel found via Mr & Mrs Smith site - just fabulous. Stylish and sophisticated with great service but still relaxed and friendly. Great food - huge flexibility on dining at lunchtime much appreciated.

Excellent huge room with everything thought all out well.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1215,"It's the little things......""",50,December 2014,"We did quite a bit of research as to where we wanted to stay for our friend's 50th birthday celebration. As The Legian was number one on Tripadvisor, we decided to book it. The reviews were so good however, we were slightly worried the reality wouldn't live up to all those good reviews. We needn't have worried! The Legian is not what I would call a ""flashy"" hotel. It doesn't have a massive lobby with shiny marble and chrome. Instead, it is conservative and discrete and very luxurious. On check in, you are not required to line up at the check in desk with all the other guests, but are escorted to your own lounge where all the paperwork is brought to you (along with a deliciously cold drink and towel). Everything is very professional, yet also warm and friendly The pool area is the best of the hotels along Seminyak beach (we checked them all out including The W, The Oberoi and The Seminyak). All the rooms have amazing views. The rooms are not brand new, nor do they have the ""wow"" factor of newer hotels (except for the view!). But they are very well appointed with a fantastic shower, very comfortable bed and pillows and quality sheets. They are also extremely clean and have everything you will need. was very happy with our 1 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor. The best thing about The Legian, however, is the amazing service from all the staff and the many little things they do to make your holiday trouble free. There are too many examples during our 3 night stay of fantastic service to write in this review. Nothing was too much trouble and most things were anticipated before we even realised we needed them! Hopefully, we will be back soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1216,Big thumbs up,50,December 2014,"We stayed at the Legian for 6 nights as a family of three (Myself, wife and 17 month baby). When we checked in we was warmly greeted by Kevin the GM. After the checking in formalities we was introduced to our butler (Chandra) and our 1 bed villa with pool.

I can only say the villa was amazing - we spent loads of time in there and the pool. It was very spacious and was ideal for our little family. We ate at the Legian several times - from breakfast in the main hotel, to in villa dining. Our butler Chandra was very helpful in making things happen for us and ensuring our stay was perfect. We did have some very small hiccups such as the villa back door not closing properly, and the DVD player not working but these were small issues that were addressed immiediately. One thing that really impressed me was when our little boy seemed to have some sort of skin allergy. We was quite concerned because in the past the doctors back home recommended that we used a non-bio detergent for our laundry as it doesn't contain any enzymes and was better for babies with sensitive skin (which our little boy has). We know that most hotels try their best to keep their linens white and clean so thought maybe it could be the detergent used. When the hotel helped call a doctor some skin lotion was prescribed and this sorted out our little boy. But Chandra was prepared to look at changing our duvet and bed sheet and possiably using a different detergent if the lotion didn't work. This to me is a sign that the Legian will go that extra length to look after their guest. I'm sure most hotels wouldn't have responded like this. The staff at the Legian really do make this place special - everyone from Kevin the GM, to Chandra, the waiters, porters / bell boys are brilliant.

The property itself really well maintained and the location is good. The view of the sea is perfect. Everything for us was perfect - from the airport pick up to the laundry service. The laundry service was excellent as it meant we could just enjoy our family time together even when we got home without having to wash everything - just how a holiday should be. The villa wasn't cheap, but when we look at the personalised service and compliementary stuff thrown in - it was actually value for money. I'd definately stay here again on my return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1217,Paradise in Bali,50,December 2014,"The legian in Bali is one of the best all round hotels anywhere. The rooms are luxurious, the food excellent and the friendly and helpful staff make this a perfect holiday location.
Nothing is too much trouble for them and they ensure you have a perfect holiday",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1218,Exceptional Service,50,December 2014,"We recently spent 5 nights at the Legian to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We had high expectations given the review history and often that can lead to disappointment. Not here, the service we received from all staff on every occassion was exceptional. We found the quality of food served in the restaurant to be much better than many name. popular restaurants in the region. The size of the hotel also gives it an intimate and personal feel. Whilst the decor isn't funky or brand new it gives the hotel an elegance and it is extremely well maintained, clean and well presented. We will return and would summarise by saying that you won't be disappointed if you stay here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1219,Top class,50,December 2014,"Relaxing few days at this top class hotel. Staff attentive, facilities great. Room great, spacious, clean, beds super comfortable- maybe improve the lighting a bit for us oldies! Only downside was on shore wind and trash on beach in front.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1220,Simply THE BEST HOTEL,50,November 2014,"Sleeping and waking up to the sound of the waves....priceless. This hotel is great, form the service you get from the airport till in toy our room, is the best customer service i ever had. All the staff soooo friend,y and efficient. The hotel is breath taking with a great view, the suite we had was sooo beautiful, sea view, the mattress was excellent , we could watch the beautiful sunset from our balcony.i loved our hotel, the breakfast with sea view, was amazing, great great choices of fruits, eggs, traditional.....we had complementary Yoga everymorning with the sea view.the restaurant food is great , the spa is one of the best. As i said simply the best. And every body call you but your name, just ana amazing service. Nothing beat this greta great. Hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1221,Excellent property - just one miss,40,November 2014,"We chose to stay in Seminyak for more food and shopping options, eventually deciding on The Legian as wanted to be right on the beach.

The villa accommodation was bundled with airport-transfer and car service to anywhere within the Kuta-Seminyak area (drop-off as well as pick-up) - very handy and efficient and even came with in-vehicle wi-fi, which is really neat for the perpetually connected, although one would argue the requirement for it unless taking a trip farther away to Ubud, Jimbaran etc... which were excluded (major bummer considering the cost and the need to hire another driver).

The property and accommodation is beautiful, spacious and well maintained (but don't expect flowers/leaves to defy gravity and not fall into the villa pool), with service professionally executed across the resort. A sink that didn't drain very well and a sound system that was not connected to the Blu-ray player were both fixed within the time we took for a dip in the pool - speaking of which, the main pools facing the ocean are really good.

I was also rather impressed I could receive almost any newspaper in the world - same-day copies even for Europe or US papers - that the hotel offered using some international newspaper distribution service.

One suggestion we have (for any hotel actually) is to have a hand shower in addition to the affixed rain shower, for the times the ladies or the kids need only a quick shower without getting their hair all wet/again.

Possibly the only low point during our stay was the mani/pedicure the Wife had, which was available only as two treatments, with a limited color selection and not very professionally done. The cost to do both actually exceeds the price of their massage (very good btw) so represented very poor value.

Overall an excellent property in itself in what I thought was a good location - only the high price will have guests demanding consistent top quality throughout the hotel and looking for service that exceeds expectations.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1222,Private Intimate Relaxing Getaway,50,December 2014,"This hotel is perfect for couples. We arrived early at the hotel. The pick up was on time and the ride from the airport to the hotel only took about 30 minutes less. We didnt wait too long, Ms Eka from front office assisted us right away, including the GM Kevin, gave us a warm welcome. We love the room, simple, sophisticated, had a very deep sleep with the sound of the seminyak ocean wave. In room dining were very good and on time. You can have your breakfast serve to the room to avoide binge eating on a buffet. They served everything very neatly. The infinite pool is awesome we truly enjoyed our swim. They provide massage by the pool too. Then we had lunch at the restaurant, The food was beautifully presented and with a surprise in flavors with each bite we had. Try the smoked salmon brioche, tuna satay grilled on the lemongrass stick, the jerky is home made, the bloody mary is awesome and refreshing, and now we are waiting for our our tuna tartar salad and fresh catch of the day which is snapper and we cant wait to see the result. This month has been raining a lot, but you can relax in the room with your blue ray dvd movies and chill with your wine and still have an awesome romantic getaway. Thank you to all the friendly and helpful staff of The Legian, these three days has been beautiful so far and we appreciate all the intimate approach you give to your guests. See you soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1223,Best hotel in Bali,50,August 2014,"We stayed here in Aug 2014 for our honeymoon. What an amazing hotel this is, absolute breathtaking service. The staff make you feel like royalty with their mind blowing service. One example would be they knew our names before our taxi pulled up to reception!!
We were given the ocean deluxe suite which was absolutely fantastic. Very modern rooms with everything at your disposal. The staff paid attention to detail with our rooms - room service was twice a day with the evening service being more focused on making the room mosquito free.
We were also invited to a cocktail evening event by the hotel management team - Kevin and especially Rohaan who took some of his time to talk with us and also to say bye to us upon leaving.
Bali is truly amazing and this hotel makes you feel part of Bali. I would recommend The Legian to anybody visiting Bali and after a quality hotel.
P.s sorry Legian for the late review! Hope to see you soon!

1224,AMAZING,50,December 2014,"Wow what an absolutely amazing experience. The hotel is stunning, one bedroom ocean deluxe suite exceeded our expectations by far. The staff are wonderful, they cannot do enough for you and the attention to detail is fantastic. A must is to have dinner in the restaurant, the food is absolutely beautiful and the view is lovely. We stayed during the rainy season which was still amazing but we missed out on seeing the sunset so I would recommend staying when it is not rainy season. Cannot fault this hotel at all, will be returning for sure! Would recommend to everyone.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1225,Excellent Service,50,November 2014,"We stayed at the Club villa for 4 nights last week. What a pleasant experience the service were. All of the staffs in the Legian are amazing – they are always with smiles and helpful when you needed. It expensive stay at the club, but worth $$$ especially you have a choice either a very quiet & privacy time at the club or venture out to the pool and beach in the main hotel. It was just perfect!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1226,"Marvellous, wonderful, perfect - a trip to remember",50,November 2014,"Stellar hotel in a brilliant location. Service, rooms, facilities are great.

1227,Fabulous beach-side resort with the best French Toast in the World.,50,November 2014,"This is definitely one of the best resorts that we have ever stayed at. Everything is absolutely awesome and perfect and there is very little that I can add to all the superlatives of other TripAdvisor reviewers.
I actually like it so much that I use this resort as my one-night stop-over on Bali when going to the Wakatobi Dive Resort in east Indonesia. I would of course like to spend more time here as the family did some years ago, but to enjoy The Legian for no more than 24 hours is a tremendous luxury. The beautiful beach, the superb infinity pools, the glorious sunset with a drink or a glass wine. The truly magnificent suites with everything that you can ever dream of. And the out of this world service - attentive, friendly, always with a smile.
Last but not least, the breakfast with fresh fruits and the fabulous Legian French Toast with fresh strawberries and whipped up mascarpone - simply the best.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1228,Exceeded my high expectations!,50,November 2014,"Wow!!!

It has all been said - but believe it. This is a unique place to stay. If you are going to Bali - look no further. I've been home for a week and I can't wait to plan my next stay.

First the staff: Exeptional! Rika at the Consierge department - thank you for all your planning ahead of our stay. You did an excellent job! Henry at the Pool bar/restaurant - thank you! (you do know how to make people smile) Ary - perosnal butler at the Villa - I am so impressed! I also need to mention the beautiful Yoga ""teacher"" (think her name was Wayan (firstborn)?) I have never experienced this kind of genuine service before. Well done!!

We stayed both at the Club Villa and a studio suite at the Hotel. It is all great. If you are willing to pay al little extra - the Villa at the Club is really worth it, but whatever you choose - you will definately be happy. They take such good care of you regardless.

Food : Excellent breakfast. Lunsj is good, but after a week I think the menu was a little ""boring"". Dinner was good, great Seafood night (Friday)! I so have to mention that our best meals was at Bambus (3 minutes car ride from the Hotel) The consierge booked this in advance - a great recommondation.

It has all been said before - so I just want to say to anyone who is consider this proerty: Just do it!!

1229,Outstanding,50,November 2014,"The Legian met and exceeded my expectations on every level. I'm not going to rant on with a long review only to say this is one of the best hotels I have every stated at. Accommodation, staff, service, the vibe... everything was polished and just supurb.

Well done The Legian team!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1230,"The pool, indoor/outdoor restaurant, with ocean view, is fantastic",40,June 2014,"This is a nice hotel right at the Legian beach. The beach itself is north of Kuta beach which is very crowded, and Legian beach is a bit quiet which is perfect for us, although I hear in July/August it can be as crowded as Kuta. It is a very popular tourist destination after all. The staff are super, super friendly and helpful, the food is good although a bit pricey compared to restaurants outside, but having lunch or sunset dinner there is fantastic, the sunset is breathtaking. I had nasi goreng (famous Indonesian fried rice) and it was great. There is a pool right near the beach. To the north is Seminyak beach which is also nice and even more quiet. The beach is just so nice and long, you can walk forever until you are tired. I definitely recommend it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1231,THE BEST RESORT IN SEMINYAK,50,November 2014,"Second to none beach front seclusion on Seminyak Beach. Other hotels and resorts aspire to become The Legian, a very, very few come close and most fail miserably. Nothing compares to The Legian. The service is professionally discrete, unobtrusive and everything is delivered with a winning smile. No wonder it's rated number 1 on Tripadvisor. And the accommodations are wonderful and sumptitious, and the bathroom toiletries ""Acqua Di Parma"" (Italian) - heavenly!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1232,Luxury resort with a personal touch,50,November 2014,"I was impressed by the personal service that was provided. I often was addressed around the resort by my name, feeling like i was a special guest. The staff also surprised me with cake and champagne in my room on my birthday. There is complementary tea time at the pool bar that coincided with the most beautiful sunsets. There is also complementary daily yoga. A fantastic resort that i plan to return to!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1233,2 bedroom suite,40,November 2014,"I've been wanting to stay here since years ago and finally did it. Not as good as I expected. The suite is spacious but a bit too dark for me, more lighting can make it better. The staffs are very attentive. Amazing beachfront. Just a few steps from the suite is the beach. Perfect for couple but not recommended for children.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1234,Pure luxury,50,November 2014,"We stayed at The Legian for 7 nights at the end of a 3 week trip to Malaysia, Australia and Bali to celebrate our anniversary and it was a perfect choice to end a fabulous holiday.
We had booked a studio suite but were upgraded to a deluxe suite. We arrived late at night and were greeted warmly. A swift check in and we were taken to our beautiful suite. We couldn't believe the size of it! A huge, tastefully decorated and comfortable living/dining area with a large flat screen TV and in-room DVD, iPod with relaxing music and 2 sofas, a separate kitchen with coffee maker, kettle and mini bar with a good range of free soft drinks as well as a private bar with beer etc and jars of crackers, nuts and cookies which were replenished daily. The bedroom was a good size (I would say the bed is a queen rather than king sized but big enough with mosquito curtains) with lots of hanging space, drawers for clothes, safe and even a set of scales and a can of insect repellent. A very large bathroom with two vanity units with hand basins, lots of toiletries, a good hair dryer, a large bath with a candle for relaxing bathing and a powerful rainfall shower. Cotton dressing gowns and comfortable slippers are provided. Bottled water for brushing your teeth is supplied daily. Additionally, 2 bottles for drinking are supplied every day and every evening, 2 more bottles were placed by the bed. The balcony was massive with a table and chairs and a day bed. On the first night, we were given a plate of delicious canapés which were very welcome. Every day, the fruit bowl was filled with local fruits and little treats such as cookies, Florentines, macaroons etc were left every evening. They even provide you with a large beach bag!
Breakfast is wonderful. Tea (really good leaf tea, in a pot) or coffee, a menu you order from consisting of just about anything you could want including eggs done anyway, smoked salmon, sausages, bacon, mushrooms, hash browns, tomatoes etc or omelettes, eggs Benedict with ham or smoked salmon (or one of each), pancakes, waffles and French toast (pain perdu with mascarpone rather than ordinary French toast). The buffet has cereals, smoothies, yoghurt, fruit, cheese, cold meat and a delicious selection of breads and pastries.
The 3 infinity pools layering down to the ocean are of different lengths and depths and are simply gorgeous.
There is a large choice of loungers or day beds by the pools, in the grounds or overlooking the beach. We chose a day bed overhanging the beach most days. As soon as you appear, one of the staff will ask you where you would prefer to be and set up your space with plenty of towels and then provide you with a tray with iced water which is replaced regularly, cold flannels and even a spray of green tea facial mist.
Lunch can be ordered at your loungers or in one of the 2 pool bars. Lots of choice and good prices. We don't often eat lunch but we enjoyed a few delicious meals including prawn tempura, Caesar salad with chicken and burgers. A bread basket with rolls and pizza bread is provided with every meal along with olive oil for dipping.
During the afternoon, little treats such as fruit punch or sorbets are delivered to the loungers and from 4-6pm, afternoon tea which is included in the price is served with dainty sweets and savouries.
All the staff are to be commended for their friendliness and courtesy. Nothing is a problem. We needed to check in online for our return flights and the concierge insisted on doing this for us and printed our boarding cards. He also asked us if we needed a car to the airport but we already had the pick up arranged. There are 4 postcards in the stationery box in the suite. We sent 2 home to the UK and asked the reception staff to add the postage to our room bill - they told us it was free! Silly little thing but how nice.
We asked if a late check out was possible but it wasn't however, a hospitality suite is provided for an hour and this was more than sufficient for us to shower and change. I guess this was one of the studio suites which we had originally booked and believe me, it was lovely. While obviously smaller than the suite we had and without a separate bedroom, it was still very large and had all the the amenities we had in our suite.
As we were checking out, the manager came to speak to us. We were very touched by this. Superb customer service.
We have always said we would never go back to any place we have visited simply because there are still many places in the world we would like to visit. We would both make an exception for The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1235,The place to Stay.,50,October 2014,"Very nice place to stay, all the previous reviews sum it up really. from the staff the rooms the facilities A1. This was our first stay in Bali so wasnt sure 100% what to expect but we were very happy.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1236,Excellent experience!,50,November 2014,"What an incredible place! The staff, amenities and overall experience was unforgettable.. I would recommend the resort to any couple or family looking to have a great experience in Bali! Within walking distance to town, shops, restaurants and local entertainment which was great!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1237,Bali getaway,50,November 2014,"Fabulous hotel. Excellent staff. Could not fault a thing. Loved it from the moment we walked into the hotel. Very welcoming.
Rooms were spacious and clean. Linen changed every day. Complimentary soft drinks and nibbles in the room. Will definitely stay there again",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1238,Best service,50,November 2014,"I travel the world extensively and would rate The Legion Hotel and its staff servicing as top three in the world. The service was extraordinary, facility outstanding, food exceptional, views amazing and the staff all highly trained in exceptional service hospitality. I cannot commend a stay at The Legion highly enough!! For a 5 star resort in Asia nothing compares with The Legian Bali experience or value. We will return in a heartbeat.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1239,Number one spot well deserved,50,November 2014,"The Legian is the best hotel in Seminyak no question about it. The design is contemporary timeless chic and the location is unbeatable near all the trendy restaurants and beach clubs.
Breakfast buffet is very sophisticated and it is hard to find similar levels of offerings in Bali.
The pool side is perfectly laid out and they added recently a third pool. The hotel feels very private and is never crowded. Yunni was my personal butler and she was amazing. The understood measure service and was always there when she was needed.
Senior management is also always present and looks after each guests in personal manner.
I can only recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1240,Fantastic hotel in a perfect setting,50,March 2014,"Bali is a beautiful island, Seminyak an idyllic location and The Legian the perfect hotel. The hotel is right on the beach with the pools seemingly connecting with the ocean. The pool temperature was perfect, the fact that you could actually swim a rare treat in these days of so called luxury pools and the poolside service was simply amazing.

The atmosphere was relaxed and tranquil, yet you got the buzz of the beach at the same time. Little snacks, cold water, towels: pampered would be an understatement.

Breakfast was just a joy with fresh fruit, cooked delights all served with charm on the terrace overlooking the pools. The perfect start to the day.

The rooms were excellent, the daily service superb; nothing was too much trouble. The gym is first class as were the spa treatments.

We had a driver from the hotel take us around the island (too little time to see so much) and it was the best value we had. He was so gracious and helpful with interesting facts and anecdotes. It was a great great day.

The hotel location is great to wander into Seminyak for dinner or shopping, although, at night, it is not for people who are unsteady on their feet with not great lighting and broken concrete and open drains. There is a supermarket opposite the hotel where you can also access an ATM.

The hotel was a great experience which actually gets better the more and more we reminisce about it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1241,"Lovely hotel, but quite overpriced",30,October 2014,"An overall lovely hotel however we were influenced by TripAdvisor reviews that this was the best hotel in Seminyak. We were left a little underwhelmed as the rooms were somewhat tired, although well maintained. While very large in size, the Deluxe Suite we had was poorly designed with wasted space, and didn't include a TV in the bedroom (instead located in the lounge area).
We felt strongly that for the money we paid (in low season), The Legian was over priced and over-rated with better and less expensive accommodation available in Seminyak (that we went and visited).
We wished there were curtains rather than blinds that were complete block out as the morning sun interfered with our sleep. The only meals we ate were for breakfast which were great.
The service was wonderful (the staff truly do try to exceed expectations in this area). The managers work hard to actively attend to the guests which made us feel valued. To be fair, there were plenty of small touches that go beyond other hotels (such as the Bose sound system, complimentary bar fridge items, pool experience and complimentary afternoon tea to name a few) but in reality next time we visit Bali, we will likely stay in Seminyak however unfortunately at a different resort.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1242,A perfect experience,50,November 2014,"We stayed 3 nights at the Legian. The stay was just perfect and an outstanding experience. The GM, who is very present and his team provided a great service in a fantastic environment. The food is superb – the Sea Food buffet on Friday night is an event not to miss! The staff is very friendly and welcomes you by name. To stay at the Legian is like a stay in the paradise.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1243,Only at The Legian!,50,November 2014,"Only at The Legian could you wander in at 3.30 in the afternoon, 5 adults and 6 children and ask for a table for lunch. Having been refused at two other high end local hotels, The Legian team made us feel like royalty. Tables were pulled together, chairs laid out to avoid the afternoon sun, water in our hands before we were even seated. This is service at another level! I have stayed at the hotel in the past and have experienced this extraordinary service as a guest. But to be greeted and treated as we were on this occasion surpassed our expectations. We enjoyed a fabulous late lunch and were able to select from a terrific range of menus. I phoned the hotel the next day in the hope that my compliments had been passed on the the team who served us down by the sea , with the fish ponds surrounding us. This is a must do experience, for a cocktail at least!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1244,World's best service.,50,November 2014,"Only one improvement could be made at this wonderful hotel - improve the coffee. Cappicinos & lattes not not as good as they used to be. The rest of the food & beverages are superb.
Provision of block-out lotion could be purchased in bulk & given to the guests on sun lounges & sun beds.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1245,Beyond Paradise,50,October 2014,"If you go to Bali and do not stay at the Legian Bali, you have missed what a 6 star resort really is. Yes I rate it 6 star and believe me, I travel the world. From the willingness of the staff to accommodate every request with a smile to the food to the fantastic setting of the hotel to the attentiveness of the hotel general manager Kevin, to every detail and to every guest. Somehow he found out it was my birthday and proceeded to have a bottle of Champagne brought to us by the pool. It felt like Fantasy Island. Every staff member knew us by name as well as were never more than a few seconds away to responding to every need......even if they were few. Kevin was everywhere....always taking to guests and making them feel like they were the only guest there he was taking care of. The rooms.....well...I upgraded to the two room suite, it was HUGE! Not that the regular room is bad at all. I could have spent the entire time in the room and on the patio watching the ocean. Yes, the per night cost is a bit higher than most of the hotels in Bali BUT...this is not your most hotels in Bali if not the ONLY. The restaurants were actually very resonablly priced and we opted to eat in on many different times. The breakfast lacked nothing . They have the best Spring Rolls! I was surprised even with a few children here and there with their families, it felt like an adult only hotel. The hotel is beautiful, it is modern with all the amenities you would want but also keeping a traditional and island look. Being from the USA, we are accustomed to fine hotels and great food and have high expectations. The Legian Bali surpassed every one of our expectations and left us wishing for MORE TIME..........I have a confession.... I packed the slippers with me when I left and wear them at home every night to remember the time we had. We are already planning a return sometime this summer and look forward to our stay at The Legian. I am confident lighting will strike twice!!! Thank you all at The Legian for a great relaxing stay. Worth every penny.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1246,Simply perfection,50,October 2014,"We spent the first 3 nights of our 3 week honeymoon here. Simply the best, best place we have ever, and probably will ever, have the pleasure to stay. The staff have impeccable manners and wonderfully grace conversation skills, everyone from the waiting staff to general manager welcome you by name (honestly, how the hell to they do that?), have a little chat as you hang out, but with the perfect balance of making you feel right at home and part of the family, but still leaving you to do your own thing.
The food in the restaurant is AMAZING, the view is AAAAA-MAZING and the only rubbish thing about it is that I can't be there every day.
We were literally heartbroken when we had to leave.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1247,Blown Away!,50,October 2014,"If there is one word to describe this hotel - it's SERVICE. The staff really go out of their way to ensure a wonderful stay - the warm and friendly greetings at the airport from the driver, being received personally at the hotel entrance by GM Kevin Abramowicz upon arrival, daily smiles and warm service from the F&B staff, and the impeccable attention from our butler Purna. Yes, our very own butler! The Legian was gracious and kind enough to upgrade our family from a 2-room unit to the Sunset Suite which was almost twice as large as our condo in Singapore! You wake up and fall asleep to crashing waves on easily the best strip of beach on the Kuta-Seminyak strip. Clear water and a sandy beach make this a good spot for surfing and bodyboarding - unlike some of the more crowded and rowdier spots near Ku De Ta two blocks away and other areas near Kuta. Surf and body boards and other equipment are free for hotel guests - plus the diligent lifeguards make an effort to watch over the kids and keep others safe from the waves and currents which can get pretty rough. It's also a 10-minute walk to the many shops and restaurants nearby. Stayed 5 nights in October and will definitely go back.

Leslie, Singapore",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1248,best hotel experience ever,50,October 2014,"We went to Bali for our honeymoon and staying at the Legian was the best choice we've ever made. We stayed there for 4 nights and I can't complain about anything. The staff was so friendly and nice, everyone was smiling and not just because they have to. Everyone was speaking english so we didn't have any communication problems at all. Our room was huge, twice the size of our apartment in New York so we've enjoyed it very much. We had a balcony with a great ocean view. The design of our room was beautiful as well. Our room was very clean during the whole time. They cleaned our room twice a day, how couldn't it be clean? There were complimentary cookies and nuts in our kitchen which were renewed daily as well as water. What I liked the most might be the little treats they were leaving in our room after afternoon cleaning. Each afternoon when we came back from the beach, we've found little desserts on our table. One day it was delicious macarons, the other day it was brownies and then chocolates. These little unexpected things just made us happy. Since we just wanted to be lazy and don't do anything except relaxing, we mostly ordered food to our room at nights and the food was delicious. Their menu has both european and local dishes, we've tried both and loved it. The breakfast was delicious too. From local fruits to pancakes, everything was on the table. They have a great beach that we've enjoyed every day, all day long. The location of the hotel was another thing. You could walk to nice boutiques and restaurants in 3 minutes. Mosquitos are a local nightmare in Bali, we had a fight with them in Ubud as well. But Legian thought of that too. We had mosquito repellents at our balcony, at the entry of our room, we had Off spray in the room so we were away from mosquitos mostly. Wifi was complimentary and was working everywhere. We've met the hotel manager while we were there too. I guess every guest staying at the Legian meets him because he's all around, taking care of every guest personally and working hard to make everyone happy. All I can say is that, we are so glad that we've picked Legian for our honeymoon. We've got more than we payed for. It's a great place to stay, rest and enjoy. I can't find any negative aspects about this place and I totally recommend it. I hope we can go to Bali again so that we could stay at Legian again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1249,Stay here!,50,October 2014,"We spent 12 nights at the Legian for our honeymoon and enjoyed every single one of them. The hotel isn't a modern clean lined hotel. It is traditional, solid and sophisticated. The rooms are very comfortable, clean and well maintained. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful with Frangipani trees, fish ponds and fountains. There are three infinity pools running out to the Indian ocean with day beds and sun loungers to choose from. At night the hotel is transformed with candles, fire pits and incense. The food here is delicious, the sea food indulgence on a Friday is wonderful.
The staff at the Legian are exceptional. We couldn't have been better looked after at every level. Very much recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1250,bliss in Bali,50,November 2014,"Whether it is the well trained staff or the well appointed rooms, this resort leaves no stone un-turned in delivering you plenty of satisfaction during my short stay. Right from the bell desk, the housekeeping, the waiters at the restaurants or the poolside bar, or the lifeguard on duty, the feeling of belonging is well evident making you feel at home and well ensconced in the comfort zone. Breakfast service was impeccable especially when you ask them to cut the local fruits which is done so well. Even at midnight, at the poolside bar, the smile was so genuine on the staff's faces which makes us feel that all of them must love working there as much as we loved staying there. Don't miss the boogie boarding since the beach is at the cleanest best at the Seminyak and we were well supervised by the life guard on duty. Also must do is watching the sunset while lounging in the infinity pool! Do take care to watch out for flying insects around dusk in certain open areas.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1251,WOW,50,October 2014,"Stayed two nights at the Legian during our recent holidays. WOW!. Should have stayed longer. An impeccable resort. The grounds, location, rooms, pool and most off all the staff and management will ensure that your stay here is magnificent..

At check we were not only greeted by the friendly staff but also the GM Kevin welcomed us to his lovely resort. We received a wonderful complimentary upgrade. After the check in formalities we were advised of the resort facilities etc and escorted to our room. The room was so large it was easy to get lost.

The staff all greet you by name, they know what you want even before you know and are there to ensure every part of your stay is catered for..

Kevin the GM mingles with the guests to ensure they are all OK and comfortable, but its not that formal style process going from chair to chair. Its natural, friendly and random as he keeps a general overview on his resort and the wellbeing of his guests during various times of the day depending on his schedule..

The staff are extremely professional and there isn't anything that is an issue.
We had a wonderful stay during our first visit to the Legian where we were truly spoilt..

Thankyou to Kevin, Eka from sales and all the Legian staff for a wonderful stay.

Mark and Susan.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1252,Definitely recommend,50,November 2014,"Hi,

My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights last week and it was fantastic.

We ended up only leaving the hotel briefly one evening for dinner. But the hotel and facilities are so excellent we didn't want to leave.

I can't add much to what has already been said,; so i'll just re-iterate that it's an excellent hotel and worth the visit......if you can save up for it ;-)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1253,Perfect Holidays,50,October 2014,"Very friendly service, we enjoyed every minute. Good organization of our daily tours inside the island. Very kind and competent driver. Fine food at exceptional location. Beautiful spots to have breakfast, lye at the beach and take drinks. We were 100% satisfied and will come again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1254,"Relaxing stay, great location excellent service",50,October 2014,"The Legian exceeded our expectations. Great beachfront location, rooms, facilities, food and service. On arrival we were greeted by Kevin, the General Manager. From the outset we could see that the management team and the staff really cared about the hotel and their guests. As a family with two teenage daughters, we were very well looked after throughout our stay. We intend to return soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1255,Amazing,50,October 2014,"This is a fabulous hotel and the food is amazing, we received a room upgrade for free and it's huge. Wifi is free and fast. The staff are all friendly the head chef stopped us to make sure we are happy the manager has done the same. I wish hotels back home used the same level of professionalism.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1256,Nothing in Bali is better than The Legian,50,October 2014,"My husband and I are frequent visitors to Bali, but hadn't stayed at The Legian since 2008 - we'd discovered newer properties in the area. It had always been a favourite of mine though, so after hearing they'd undergone a renovation I was desperate to return and booked 4 nights at the tail end of our most recent 2 week trip.

I am thrilled to see The Legian as brilliant as ever; the renovations adding modern touches and value while retaining all I loved about it.

Check-in was flawless - greeted by the hotel manager and promptly taken to our ground floor suite (my preference). The suites have the same floor plan, still spacious and grand - now featuring flat screen TVs and a few other new mod cons.
The 4-poster bed is gone (a good thing) and the new bed was firm: fantastic. Bathrooms are enormous, ample wardrobe space for two people.

But you expect all that at a property like this. So here's what sets The Legian apart:

- those three, tri-level, wet edged infinity pools which, when you're in them, make you feel like you could touch the oceans waves. No-one has a pool like this.

- the poolside staff are like ninjas. You arrive, and immediately you have two towels per person, two glasses of ice cold water, two cold wet face towels and a refreshing facial mist spray.

- the noise levels: perfect. Even the children by the pool were relaxed and quiet.

- we are an adventurous couple and prefer to venture away from hotels to eat - but not at The Legian. All food here, breakfast, complimentary afternoon tea, poolside snacks, room service - is outstanding (and reasonably priced).

- most of your mini bar items are complimentary and refreshed morning and night (not alcoholic beverages).

- the gym has cold carafes of fresh coconut water

- the staff

I have developed particularly high standards after years of experience at a variety of premium hotels - The Legian remains well ahead of its peers.

The Legian: thank you. I achieved ultimate zen.

9/10. Highly recommend. Will absolutely return. Soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1257,"Outstanding still, 6th time around",50,October 2014,"Our 6th stay at the Legian - it is without a doubt the best hotel we've ever stayed in. The staff are welcoming, attentive, discreet, and never say no. They know what service is all about. The manager Kevin and assistant manager Rohaan head a spectacular team. We finished our Indonesian holiday this time with 4 nights at the Legian, with stays prior on Gili T and at the Mulia at NusaDua. The Legian outshines everywhere. It has such a soul, and even though the loo's in the Mulia have auto lids, warm seats, can front-wash, back-wash, dry and flush on standing, we'll wipe our own tails and stay at the Legian every time!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1258,Absolute perfection,50,September 2014,"I spent two weeks in this hotel in late September 2014. I travel very extensively and have had a lucky opportunity to stay at various hotels, uncluding luxury ones, in all the continents. Bearing that in mind, I still can say very confidently that The Legian is well ahead many of its peers (e.g. Imperial in Tokyo or even 12 Apostles in Cape Town). I have said this to The Legian's management in person and can say it here yet again that, to me, it is very obvious that this is the management's achievement - Mr Kevin Abramovicz (general manager) and Mr Rohaan Chandra (executive assistant manager). They share the same passion about hospitality and, most importantly, they know how to deliver what they want.

The standards of service at this place are outstanding. This is what a 5* hotel experience should always be and used to be years ago but, sadly, is not there anymore in the vast majority of places. I cannot fault the service, nor the standards of cleanliness, nor the standards of cuisine. They have an aspiring chef (Mr Luke MacLeod) now, and it is the same case as with the management: the aspiration is solidly backed up by technical proficiency.

The Legian's restaurant is, most probably, the most expensive in the neighbourhood but it is certainly worth a visit: as with the hotel, the price/quality combination is there.

The pool staff (I did my best on the morning of my departure to thank as many of them as I could but I was pressed for time and sadly, I didn't thank all those whom I wanted to thank) are very attentive, polite, and efficient. Most of them (there are some exceptions but they are not worth mentionning) have managed to find a delicate balance of being always at hand, ready to converse (if necessary), and unobtrusive without being overfamiliar and annoying at the same time.

I have very much enjoyed my experience at The Legian and I am looking forward to visiting the place again in a year or two.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1259,the best!,50,October 2014,"really the best we ever had, great staff,food, facility. we stayd in the two bedroom villa, never seen anything like it! have your own pool and butler, very helpfull making your reservations for restaurants and taking care of transport in your Lexus with private driver....",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1260,Extremely satisfied!,50,October 2014,"I was totally amazed by this hotel. Everything from the staff to the food was perfect. The General Manager was there to receive me and my friends personally. We got an upgrade to the master suite with an amazing infrastructure. Food is delicious , pool, sunset view. We were supported by one of the staff members called Purka that created for me a new reference of service level. Totally recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1261,Best Place I Have Every Stayed At!!,50,October 2014,"Booked under AMEX Platinum Hotels and Resorts, upon checkin got 100 USD F and B credit and upgraded room. Took my sisters and my girlfriend and they were blown away.

Amazing service and facilities. Close to the action and the hustle and bustle of Seminyak and great restaurants yet is secluded from the street by a wall and its own private beach. Once you step on the premises you feel completely secluded and in your own space.

The rooms were simply incredible, so much character and turn down service was an amazing touch. I have used tripadvisor for years but this is my first review, because I am that blown away. Will come and stay again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1262,Most Elegant Hotel Anywhere,50,October 2014,"Six star standards, stellar service, incredibly beautiful and maintained rooms, first class all around. Fantastic location right on the beach. Perfect sunsets. Breakfast and dinner in restaurant we well presented and flavorful. Staff always friendly and extra attentive. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels all over the world. This ranks with the best.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1263,Outstanding,50,October 2014,"This is the finest property we have ever stayed regardless of country or location. The staff does not know the meaning of the word no, whatever you need, desire, ask is dealt with quickly and always with a smile. They were nice enough to upgrade us to an amazing 2 bedroom suite which was spectacular in every way shape or form. The pool overlooking the beach was quite popular with us and having someone caring for your every need taken care of before you could even think to ask was incredible. There are alot of hotels in Seminyak and Bali (we also spent a week in Ubud besides the week at the Legian) I would be startled to hear if there were a better one then the Legian, total value for your vacation dollar and I truly hope we can visit again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1264,Relaxing Hotel even with children,50,October 2014,"Our third trip to Bali was purely to relax. This was our first stay at The Legian Bali and I doubt it will be our last. From WA this is certainly a long weekend destination. The service and attention to detail is exceptional. We had a two bed suite which was excellent space for our family of five including teenagers. The waves and boogie boards were a big hit with the children and allowed hours of relaxation for Mum and Dad. Staff were all very attentive and helpful.
The hotel is well situated to dip in and out of Seminyak as you wish,with a peaceful oasis to wander back to.For this family it hit the right note to be able to experience all that is Bali but to be able to retreat from it and relax. The food we ate in the hotel was excellent the serving of afternoon tea around the pool is a very nice touch. Thanks to all the staff for delivering what we wanted a relaxing holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1265,Perfection!,50,October 2014,"Exceptional hotel. Thoroughly deserves its reputation and status as the best on the island.

Everything you would expect from a 5-star residence. Impeccable décor and wonderful design throughout. Impressively grand, and yet with a very relaxing warm ambience.

However, the best aspect by far is the staff. Without doubt they were the friendliest, happiest, most welcoming and attentive we have ever experienced. Always on hand, they already know what you might need even before you ask, nothing too much trouble, literally faultless. In places this good, it goes without saying that the rooms/pool/dining/facilities etc are top-of-the-range. However, it is the level and quality of service which underlies everything and which can make the difference between a ""nice holiday"" and an ""unbeatable holiday"". For sure, the team at The Legian could not have made it our visit more perfect! They are an absolute credit to the hotel.

We stayed as a couple for three nights in mid-October. We took a one-bed deluxe suite which was huge - two bathrooms, a dining room, sitting room, pantry, two balconies - one with easily enough room for ten people. Immaculate housekeeping and room service of course.

It's a large enough hotel to easily accommodate all guests comfortably - couples of all ages, groups, those with children, some singles. Never felt at all crowded, let alone noisy. The grounds are beautifully maintained and huge, the three pools equally big. Plenty of choice for places to relax - around the pool, on the edge of the beach, or further away in even more private and tranquil spots. The pool bars always had available tables for lunches during the day. The restaurant in the evening is spacious yet intimate and, of all the hotels viewed from the beach, none looked as elegant and inviting for dinner.

We cannot recommend this hotel enough. We wanted to stay longer. We will definitely return!

1266,Luxury,50,September 2014,"The one bedroom villa was very spacious with a four poster bed, separate study area, large sitting area and dressing area with separate shower. The sitting area hosted a range of complimentary drinks and nibbles. The garden area was very well kept with a personal 10m swimming pool and a very large bath under cover which was perfect for a candle lit hot bath when the rain started.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1267,Honeymoon bliss,50,October 2014,"The legian hotel is simply put the best hotel I've ever stayed in. 5stars don't do it justice. The attention to detail from the moment we arrived has been unbelievable. All the staff..even those we've never met before call us by name and cannot do enough for you. Nothing is out of place in this hotel..not a single light bulb gone, or candle not lit! There's a nespresso machine in the kitchenette, I pod plugged into the sound system..even the ashtrays have the hotels logo pressed into the sand....fantastic! The general manager Kevin greeted us on arrival and there were really lovely touches in the room on arrival including some champagne, a little cake and lots more.

Only negative is that the cocktails are expensive..but we expected that coming here...would be great if there was a happy hour.

All in all I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel, the facilities, the attention to detail and the staff. This has been an amazing honeymoon and I look forward to coming again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1268,Our Honeymoon Hotel,50,October 2014,"Attention to detail and service never experienced previously!! Although you will pay top price to enjoy the Legian experience, it really is worth it! The staff are so friendly and make it their business to call you by your name which is always more personable and leads to very pleasant conversations. Our suite is top standard and we really can't find fault with the Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1269,Great and relaxing stay,50,October 2014,"We had a great three-night stay mid October 2014 at The Legian after travelling in Bali and Java. We very much appreciated the attentive service from the beginning until the end of our stay. We were surprised about all the small presents during the relaxing sunbath or at dinner, the sweeties in our room and at our last day, the nice hospitaliy room due to our late checking out time. We as well appreciated the cleanness of the hotel. For us, it goes without saying, that the high quality of The Legian depends on the experienced Swiss General Manager, Kevin Abramovicz. He is visible not only to the guests but also, and maybe not less important, to the staff. Everybody who wants to enjoy some relaxing days at a nice beachside hotel and does not want to miss Swiss quality and standard combinded with the Asians kindness makes a good choice with The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1270,"Truly a five star hotel, providing a five star experience and service",50,October 2014,"We stayed at the Legian for five days with our family of six (two adults and four small children). We had a wonderful time. Our room (we stayed in a two-bedroom suite) was spacious, very comfortable and modern in a Balinese style, the pools and gardens are beautiful and the service in this hotel is superb. The staff are very friendly and very diligent. They go out of their way to help you in anyway they can and no request seems too much for them. The location of the hotel is ideal, at the sea but also close to shops and restaurants for those who want to go off the hotel premises. The general manager and assistant manager are very visible and present in the hotel and that does not go unnoticed. This hotel is not cheap, but in my view, you get value for money. I would love to come back here sometime.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1271,Exceptional service; great beachfront location; yummi food.,50,October 2014,"We recently stayed here after having changed plans as a result of typhoon Vongfong. We chose it based on the excellent reviews and they are well deserved. It was a flawless stay. We opted for the club room which came with a very attentive butler, which made everything very easy. We felt at home in a matter of hours. The manager Kevin, found us and introduced himself. He was a visible presence every day, which made a very good impression, especially after having come from a stay at the Singapore Ritz Carlton, where the management was invisible. We would rate our experience at this hotel as number one of all time for service and friendliness; the facilities are 5-star level, but not above and beyond others in this class; ditto for the food and beverage service. The pool area is on top of the beach with plenty of space/chairs. It does not have a big bar scene, if that's your thing. What put this place in its own class for us was the consistently exceptional service from manager on down, which was delivered in such a friendly way that it warmed our hearts every time. Naturally, we hope to stay there again soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1272,Fantastic week,50,October 2014,"As LHW Club members we received a very generous upgrade from a 2-bedroom suite to the Legian suite which is also 2 bedrooms but very much larger with a huge terrace overllooking the beach. The food is excellent and varied. We always had lunch at the pool bar and several times dinner in the main restaurant. Unfortunately, wines are very expensive as everywhere in the far east. I would highly recommend this resort to everyone unconditionally.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1273,As smooth as Cuban Jazz,50,October 2014,"Their comes a point in every professional's life when they should get paid for what they know rather than what they do.
This hotel is in that sort of head space and it shows.
The vibe here is Cuban Jazz rather than Indie Pop.
This is not the place to come to live out the movie star dream. This place respects you and surprises you with its confidence, efficiency and ability to partner with each guest as an individual. This moves the relationship above what other hotels would consider as exceptional service, to one that envelops you in a sophisticated journey of hospitality.
We came as a family of 3 (2 adults & one 9year old) for a 3 day power break. On the last day no one wanted to leave.
Others have spoken of the amenities and all are as you would expect, the difference here is the experience of the people and their ability ensure your visit will be memorable.
The only issue was the breakfast orange juice lacked authenticity on the last day.
But don't let that deter you from booking into one of the best hotels we have found in South East Asia.

1274,Lovely hotel....albeit not traditional Balinese,50,October 2014,"This is a lovely hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The rooms were spacious. Food was good. Staff were lovely....so lots and lots of pluses. The only ""but"" is that it didn't feel like traditional Bali....because it isn't supposed to be, it is luxurious. We stayed at Aman Dari for a few nights before we came to the Legian so we got the best of both worlds and I think that is the best way to see Bali. Complimentary soft drinks from the minibar in the room is also a very good idea and I hope other hotels follow suit. Manager was very polite and welcoming when we arrived. If you only stay at the Legian though, make sure you take a couple of tris out of the area to see more of the beautiful island. Ubud, for example, is wonderful.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1275,Want For Nothing,50,September 2014,"Our suntans are fading, we've returned to our everyday lives but the feeling of relaxation and well-being lingers from our 8 day stay at The Legian. We wanted for nothing our entire stay - in fact we could have just packed our swimwear and passports and the rest would have been taken care of by our attentive and efficient staff. We opted for a private villa at The Club to get the best of both worlds; our own private pool, residence and butler as well as exclusive use of The Club's marvellous guest pool, bar and restaurant...then, when we fancied, we wandered over the road to the Hotel's beautiful 3 tiered infinity pool, reclined on the day beds and enjoyed the soft breeze and beach views whilst sipping a cocktail. And the sunsets. Special mention should be made of the superb service by our butlers Arishna and Bona; the attentive, friendly and efficient skills of Nonik at The Club bar and Alex, the F&B Manager who waved a magic wand to get us a great reservation at nearby Sarong for dinner. And if you want to add 10 years to your life, be sure to get a massage from Leci at The Spa. Dining at the Restaurant is superb, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. Shopping in Seminyak is fun, but you are sure to find yourself beating a hasty retreat to the perfect ambience of the Legian after a while..Extra special mention to Kevin the General Manager who has masterminded a hotel experience which surpasses all other comparisons..congratulations. We will return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1276,"The Club at Legian - Amazing Villa, Outstanding Service",50,September 2014,"My wife and I stayed at the Club for our 10th anniversary. From the moment we arrived and was greeted by the GM to the moment we left our experience was incredible. The Legian takes customer service to a different level. The staff will do anything in their power to make sure your stay is first rate.

We stayed in Villa #4. The villa is large, well appointed with every amenity you would need or want. There’s also a large private outdoor area and pool. It’s such a wonderful space that you may never want to venture out. Our butler Sande saw to our every need. With his wonderful personality and outstanding service he made our stay that much more memorable.

Even though you can have breakfast in the villa, we opted for breakfast in the main hotel. The restaurant overlooks the ocean and infinity pool (actually pools – there are three on staggered levels so regardless of which one you’re in you still have an amazing view of the ocean). Breakfast here on a beautiful morning is serene and magical. Definitely takes the heart rate down a few beats.

The list of activities in Bali is endless. From surfing to scuba diving, visiting temples (Tanah Lot and Uluwatu are a must), incredible sunsets (Rock Bar), shopping and restaurants (Bumbu Bali). Depending on time of day traffic can be a bear. The best way to get around, if you can figure out the way there, is by moped. When cars are stuck in traffic the mopeds just zoom by.

The Legian Bali ranks as one of the best hotels I’ve ever had the pleasure of visiting. I hope to one day return to this outstanding hotel in this amazing place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1277,Superb,50,October 2014,The legian is simply superb. Without a doubt the most perfect place to chill and relax. The team are attentive and genuine. We will most certainly be back.

1278,Outstanding Hotel!,50,June 2014,"Amazing hotel, our room was incredible and huuuuge, the view from our room was breathtaking.

Highly recommend this hotel, no reason to every leave it's grounds.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1279,It's the best!,50,May 2014,"The service, rooms, atmosphere and food are all outstanding. Don't waste your time looking for other places, this is the best Hotel in the area. I went to a few of the other hotels down the strip including the Oberoi but nothing compares. Stayed in a deluxe suite, do it, you won't regret it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1280,"Amazing hotel , average service",30,September 2014,"The good:
- Brilliant location - beautiful sunsets watched from the comfort of your balcony or by the poolside (same view as KuDeTa or PotatoHead, and you don't have to fight for a seat)
- Amazing rooms
- Very efficient room service/housekeeping (If i requested a towel, I will have it in minutes)
- Great pool, great landscaping, nice fish ponds (if you are travelling with children, do ensure you ask the attendant at main entrance for fish food. My son had a blast feeding the fish)
- Food is generally good (do try the Friday bbq - very good quality)

The bad
- Service is inconsistent (some days i get treating like royalty, other days they pretend not to see me as i walk past). I would rate the service as a four star or a generic 5 star (e.g. hilton, sheraton) - not equal to the amount i pay for. The miss the small touches and the never made me go ""wow"". We stayed here for 6 nights, and ate in the hotel 90% of the time, most times they don't remember our names (keep asking for room number), and don't remember what we normally have. To put into perspective, we stayed at the sister hotel Chedi @ Tanah Gajah, by the 2nd morning they were saying ""1 black and 1 decaf as usual ?""

- The hotel is also small and built next to other hotels. I had a corner suite , and next to me was the Samaya Hotel. The Samaya held 2 events (a corporate event on Saturday, and wedding on Sunday) and i could hear it loud and clear from my room. My afternoon naps were ruined as they were rehearsing in the afternoon and at night they partied until 10:30-11pm. It ruins the exclusivity of the hotel when i can hear karaoke singing or 'testing mic 1 2 3"" constantly from my room.

I gave this an average because although it is an amazing hotel, I am not getting the service for the price i am paying. Stay at Legian for the view or the convenience of being near the shops at Seminyak.

If you want service - i would recommend elsewhere",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1281,Wow,50,September 2014,"If you ever wondered what the perfect hotel experience would be - this is it.

From the moment you enter to the moment you leave the staff treat you so well - walking around I felt like everybody knew who I was!

Service: beyond amazing. Rooms: Amazing. Bathrooms: amazing. The pool? Take pictures and your friends will rage with envy. Their gym is well-equipped and clean. Tons of spa services if you're into that - and morning yoga is great. The breakfast food was amazing, and of course - the views from every part of the hotel were exactly what you wished for when you come to Bali.

Really - I couldn't ding them if I tried.

Sure, it's expensive, but you've probably flown across the world. Splurge and live like a king.

I had unfortunately booked a villa with some incoming friends, but I almost debated leaving them to stay here instead. That's how amazing it is.

1283,Expected more for the cost hence the rating.,40,September 2014,"I recently stayed at The Legian for a 5 night stay with my husband. We arrived at the airport and were met by a rep from the resort and then ushered into a taxi for our trip to the resort. For the cost we paid we were expecting an actually hotel vehicle not a taxi. I had relatives staying at other resorts for only half the nightly rate we were paying and they all had hotel vehicles transfer them to their resorts. On our departure however the hotel vehicle took us to the airport so maybe they were all in use.
The staff were very good and very polite always enquiring when we saw them as to how everything was. When we were taken to our room we were delighted as it was a lovely room on the ground floor which meant we had easy access to the pools and the restaurant and bar.
Breakfast was very good and I looked forward to it each day.
Now the issues I did have.....for the room rate we paid I would expect everything to be perfect.
We both got many mosquito bites and this was while inside our unit. I can't tell you how many mosquito's I killed when getting up to go to the bathroom in the night. And also they drove me crazy buzzing around my ears when in bed. We did ask several times for a mosquito coil one evening (they do have plugin repellant for inside and also a coil we were using outside)and they did eventually bring one but I hate to say that it took 3 phone calls to get it.
Even though they did a real thorough spray and left coils burning the next day we still managed to have fresh bites after sleeping, this continued for our stay. I did try my best to knock out the population of mosquito's during my night toilet visits which seem to be when I saw them.
The other thing we found frustrating is that with the daily housekeeping we had to ask for the complimentary snacks to be replaced. I know this sounds trivial but they we very nice and we looked forward to having them with our evening drinks so I imagine they got sick of our phone calls each evening asking for them to be replenished.
Also we had an issue with sewerage smell in the toilet/bathroom which they remedied on their second attempt.
We stay at many hotels around the world and the thing I want to emphasis is that The Legian is a lovely hotel but not up to standard for what they are charging in comparison to other resorts/hotels in Bali.
Oh and the service around the pool was incredible and almost made up for the issues we did have. FYI we paid $880SGD including taxes per night stay. I would not stay here again at this cost.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1284,Great hotel! Hope to return again one day!,40,September 2014,"Before staying here, I'd read many many reviews on Tripadvisor, and hence had somewhat high expectations of the service, rooms, food, and grounds.. I can say that over 90% of our expectations were met, and our family of eight (6 adults and 2 kids) enjoyed a lovely week at The Legian in celebration of our 6th wedding anniversary.

My husband and I stayed for 3 nights with our infant son at the 1BR Club Villa across the street, while my parents, in-laws and daughter stayed in a 2BR suite at the main hotel. After 3 nights, we also moved to the main hotel, into the room that my parents vacated at the 2BR suite, so...we got to experience both room types. Both the villa and suite were very spacious, well-furnished, and well-stocked with complimentary drinks and snacks.. We definitely enjoyed the villa's private pool as a family, and made as much noise as we wanted, enjoyed afternoon tea served in the outdoor seating area, and also a private breakfast on one of the mornings. My 3 year-old daughter loved the smaller pool--perhaps not so intimidating as the main 3-tier infinity pool at the main hotel--but I loved the larger one, which looks onto the ocean and roaring waves..what a view! If I had to choose, I'd say my husband and I both preferred the room at the villa, esp. the bathroom, outdoor bath...but at the Club, you definitely miss out a bit on the vacation/resort feel, as you don't get to see the other guests lounging about, and don't hear the ocean.

Service: Everything everyone else has said about The Legian is true... The staff are almost ALL very polite, prompt, discreet, friendly, and professional. They remember your name, which isn't a very big deal to me, but it was a nice touch... Our personal butler at the villa, Ngurah, was very nice with providing extra towels and bottles of water, knowing we had to fill water bottles and make baby formula multiple times a day. They remembered our anniversary TWICE...at the villa one evening, we returned from dinner to find a lovely chocolate mousse cake waiting, and a suite adorned with rose petals. But it was a couple days early! The next morning, I thanked the butler and told him he'd made a mistake, saying our anniversary was a few days later, but he said he knew all along, but because we were leaving the villa, he decided to congratulate us early! How rare is that? Then, on the real day of our anniversary, we of course weren't expecting anything anymore, we returned from dinner to the 2BR suite and there, again, was a cake AND a bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us.. Is ""too friendly"" possible when describing a hotel? Needless to say we were very impressed, thankful, and embarrassed to have troubled the hotel twice.

A couple of us fell ill on our trip, and saw the hotel's in-house nurse and doctor, as well as traveled to Denpasar to see a specialist. The hotel helped to arrange our doctor appointments, and all went smoothly. We went to Denpasar with our own hired driver, otherwise The Legian would've helped to arrange something for us.

Re: vehicles, I have a niggling complaint, though minor... While staying at the Club, one of the perks is that you have the use of a complimentary driver to drop you off to nearby locations within the Seminyak area. Unfortunately, we hadn't known of this service before, so we had hired our own driver on standby for the first couple days after our arrival, and hence didn't use the hotel's car. Later, when we moved into the main hotel, I asked offhandedly if we might still use the complimentary driver services since we hadn't used them at all, and was told that the Club privileges were only valid while we were staying at the Club, and no longer applicable after we'd moved over to the main hotel. A'way, I understand that if our request had been to use the villa's pool after we checked-out, it would be reasonable to say no, but it seemed a bit inflexible that the car service couldn't be made available. At any rate, the cabs to nearby restaurants weren't expensive, but this incident deflated The Legian's legendary reputation as being bend-over-backwards accommodating.

HOWEVER. On the day of our check-out, the hotel allowed us to stay in our suite until 7pm, the time we had arranged to leave for the airport to catch our 10pm flight. With two kids in tow, my husband and I felt very grateful for not having to hang around the hotel from noon onwards (the standard check-out time), and this final generosity pretty much erased our issues over the hotel car.

Food: While the food is really good, I should inform future guests considering this hotel, that the menu is the same at all of the hotel's restaurants... Unfortunately, I had to worry about filling my children's tummies, so I found the menu to be slightly limiting, even though they were able to cook many things to order. (Their gnocchi with cream sauce was a definite hit with my son!) The breakfast buffet spread kind of got old after the 5th or 6th day...luckily we could order different ala carte items for variety. They have great french toast, waffles, hot eggs dishes...and all well-portioned.

The one night we had dinner at the main restaurant was very romantic... I loved the pork cutlet, cooked so well...and regret that we didn't try the special Balinese menu by the chef.

Spa: I had a relaxing Balinese massage with a complimentary facial. Both were great, not outstanding, but I couldn't find fault with them either.

Rooms & Grounds: The Legian is very well-kept, has nice lawns, clean pools, many fish ponds and plants... The villa's landscaping was very neat, with water features, and regularly treated for mosquitoes. Not to fault the hotel, but the mosquitoes were a nuisance. I requested our rooms to be sprayed every evening during turn-down service, cos after the first few days, my kids had all been bitten multiple times on the face during the night. Each kid had at least 5 bites on their face, not to mention elsewhere on their limbs and bodies...which of course they couldn't stop scratching. The manager mentioned the problem was worse this year, so I guess we were just unlucky despite the complimentary bug spray the hotel provided, complimentary mosquito coils and electric mosquito repellents..

One final comment... The beds are very luxurious and soft, perfect for sinking into, but we woke up in the morning often in a damp-ish bed, cos the duvets were too warm to sleep within despite us turning down the air-conditioning to 21-22 degrees Celsius. A lighter-weight duvet, or light blanket, might've provided better quality of sleep...though, again, this is a minor issue, and probably not a universal one given everyone's sleep preferences.

All in all, I would definitely return to The Legian again if only to enjoy it more without my kids in tow...cos, honestly, this vacation seemed more like work, having to entertain two young children. : ) Great hotel, great location, a little overpriced, but filled with little touches that show how much they care about each guests' experience... We will definitely return. Thanks!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1285,World Class Service,50,September 2014,"First Class Service.
I have been fortunate to stay in many of the leading Hotels in Bali and can honestly say that The Legian is hands down the best.
A holiday is about the people you meet and the experiences you share. The staff cannot do enough for you, polite, knowledgeable and friendly.

1286,A great hotel - what a dilemma!,50,September 2014,"I hate reviewing hotels that I really love, because deep down I want to keep them secret so that they're not too busy for me next time!

The Legian was recommended to me by a colleague as a family friendly hotel. My wife and I avoided it until we had a child of our own, and then decided to go! What a find this hotel is!

Best location in Seminyak: The Legian sits centrally on Seminyak beach, walking distance to Ku De Ta and the Oberoi to the south and Potato Head and the W Hotel to the north. It is walking distance to the main food (Jalan Kayu Ala) and shopping streets (Jalan Raya Seminyak). But why would you walk anywhere when you have an amazing beachfront, 3 beautiful pools and manicured grass / gardens to enjoy the waves and the Seminyak sunset?

Serenity: Despite being family friendly (you can hire nannies and there are kids club activities) everyone feels like they have their own space. There's plenty of room at breakfast (complimentary buffet that's pretty amazing), there's always a sun bed or bale available (despite it being peak season while we were there), and when we were in our suite, the only thing we heard were the crashing waves. Speaking of the suite, it was large and comfortable with all the amenities: excellent clean and comfortable bedding / great bathroom amenities (Acqua di Parma) and soft towels / complimentary non alcoholic mini bar and afternoon tea / Bose sound system and 3 flatscreen TVs. Did I mention the huge balcony overlooking the ocean.

Service: the staff at The Legian like to think of each other as family. A lot of the staff that worked there had been there for a long time, some since the hotel opened over 20yrs ago. They take pride in their hotel and this is evident through their exemplary service, upkeep of the hotel rooms and grounds, and by making you feel at home (many staff made the effort to remember our names, and that of our son). We had a private butler with our suite, Widastra, who organised everything for us (including our clothes), provided excellent restaurant recommendations and reservations, and made sure he was around for our entire 7 day stay (taking a break only after we checked out!).

Management: one night, the management of the hotel invited several of the guests for complimentary cocktails and canapés so that they could get to know their guests better, listen to feedback, and educate the guests on all the services that are available. What an amazing thing to do? After meeting the spa manager, we booked ourselves in for a wonderful treatment the next day, and after meeting the GM and sales manager, were invited to check out the private villas for our next stay. This is clearly a hotel that will maintain its standards in the future.

Management did ask a question that I couldn't answer at the time, was there anything that I disliked about the stay? I thought about this for the rest of the night and could only come up with one: the free yoga classes at 8am every morning, the one on the grass overlooking the beach, was a little too slow for my liking. After yoga on the first morning, I had to make do with the modern and well equipped gym instead!",The Legian Seminyak Bali

1290,P E R F E C T I O N,50,September 2014,"We loved so much The Legian that we decided to go back only two days after we left it for Ubud - spending in total ten wonderful days at it!

The location - right on the beach - is simply stunning. You can admire the waves and the sunset sipping a cocktail on your beach chair or balcony. The three-story pool is fantastic. We very much enjoyed the restaurant and its very nice setting and delicious food. Breakfast is a combination of buffet and à-la-carte dishes, while dinner menu offers local and international options revisited by a talented Chef who came greet us several times. The Spa is also very nice - and even nicer you can get your spa treatment right on your beach chair with the waves noise on the back - very relaxing! We stayed first in a two-bedroom suite and then in a studio suite and found both very nicely decorated and cosy. We especially liked the large terrace and beautiful ocean views.

The staff at The Legian is one of the best we have ever encountered during our many hotel stays thoughout the world. From the concierge to the front desk, going through the restaurant, beach, bar, etc ... the professionalism, courtesy and friendliness of all staff members - and of the general manager Kevin - is definitely one of the thing we enjoyed the most during our stay!

On our departure day with us flying out late evening, although they could not provide us with late check out we were provided at no charge a 'hospitality' suite to use for an hour of our choosing to freshen up before leaving for airport. Complimentary soft drinks and juices in mini bar and a great pod coffee machine in all rooms. Highly recommend The Legion in seminyak and plan to return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1293,Bali Paradise,50,September 2014,"My husband and I spent 12 perfect days in paradise at this beautiful GHM hotel. This was our 2nd visit to Bali and we chose to stay again at The Legian as we could not take the risk of being disappointed in making a different choice.
We were welcomed back with all the warmth of honoured guests enjoyed a chilled drink and chat with the manager and check in was a breeze as our details were already available from our previous stay.
We could not praise Kevin J Abramoniez and all his staff for their attentiveness. There are just to many to name and we would feel remiss is missing someone out if we were to start mentioning names.
The Legian has customer service perfected staff remembering your favourite drink always and I have no idea as to how they remember all the guests names as we would love to have that skill.
The spa treatments are devine such a calming peaceful setting to relax and be spoilt.
Other little touches like the complimentary high tea between 4 and 6 pm. The refreshing cool towels and frequently refilled iced water and cool face mist supplied while you relax on one of the many lounges under the palms.
I could go on and on but feel all has been said by many other reviewers do yourself the biggest favour and if your off to Bali this is where you want to stay and experience first hand The Legian experience.
We have travelled the world over the years and only came to Bali last year for our nephews wedding the reason we returned was the exceptional customer service and pleasure we had in staying here.
We are already deciding what month we will return in 2015.
Please pass on our thanks to all the staff at The Legian they are the very best.

1294,Legian review,50,June 2014,"Hi , myself and my partner found the legian a superb hotel with excellent staff. We have to say a special thank you to Agung Bagoes who was just superb during our time there. He was always so helpful and would really go out his way to make sure the guest of the legian where happy and comfortable . He is a complete asset to the hotel.We will definetly be coming back next year. Great place,great hotel,great staff 10/10 :-)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1295,understated luxury,50,September 2014,just back from a week here to recharge the batteries and it was perfect .Have stayed here before but not since there have been some upgrades to pool area and rooms The staff are superb and the hotel could not be better ..location and amenities are first class This is my favourite place to stay in bali and we will be back soon,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1296,Amazing,50,September 2014,"I was there for a short week end with my wife and the service is very attentive and professional.
the location of the hotel is perfect, front beach ,quiet, in the middle of Seminiak
the pool is amazing, huge in three different step overlooking the ocean.
the chef made a special menu for us and his food was perfect
the spa was also outstanding, the room are spacious and beautiful, you get full quality amenity
The GM make sure everything is perfect
thank a lot to everyone",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1297,Outstanding once again,50,September 2014,"It would be hard to imagine how our return to the Legian would surpass our experience last year but yet again they have exceeded our expectations. We were fortunate enough to enjoy 2 weeks at this beautiful hotel. One week in the beachside hotel and the second in the Villas across the road. From our interaction with all the staff to the beautiful food in any of the restaurants, we could not find any fault. The staff is what made our stay so special. We were treated like retuning friends rather than guests. Our stay in the beachside resort was, like last year, so very memorable. This time we were in a one bedroom deluxe suite which we found extremely spacious and beautifully appointed. The staff helpful and unseen. Nothing we asked for was an issue with them following up after to enquire how we went. After a week we transferred to ""The Club"". We thought the beachside hotel was outstanding but this was an extraordinary experience. The Villa was superb! again beautifully appointed with total privacy and serenity by our private pool. We loved spending the mornings by the beachside pool and then returning to the peace and quiet of the villa. Evenings were spent in ""The Club"" restaurant/bar for cocktails. The Club also has it's own beautiful large pool for Club guests only, which was a lovely option for another swim. We ate at all the restaurants and loved loved loved the food especially Chef Luke's Balinese menu in the Club restaurant. Each villa is serviced by a private butler who was at our disposal for the entire stay. He was discrete and available whenever we needed anything. An absolutely delightful young man. A driver is available to all Club guests whenever we wanted to venture into the local area. We found them extremely helpful and polite. They answered questions and did some translating when we asked. This hotel has the number one tripadvisor rating for this area for good reason and they are up against some great competition. We congratulate the General Manager for exceeding our expectations once again and can't wait for our next visit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1298,BEST HOTEL EVER,50,September 2014,"The Legian is quite simply, extraordinary. It was a privilege to spend 8 nights here and to experience the beauty of the environment, the respect and pride that this hotel generates and the staff who reflect that back to you in every moment. Actually my partner and I referred to the Legian as a temple, not a hotel. Perhaps this is why the service that is delivered to their guests is of another level entirely and why it is always mentioned on TripAdvisor. Because you can only truly be of service if that is how you live.

Thank you to absolutely everyone we came into contact with. From the wonderful gentleman who greeted us at the airport and who also looked after us so well when we returned, to reception, the dining areas, the pool area and housekeeping. (BTW, the best room I have ever stayed in). Even the security staff who helped us walk across the street. I have forgotten many of your names I’m so sorry but you were all part of our experience and you are all in our hearts. I want to particularly thank Verina, the head concierge who was so charming and helpful on many occasions, the beautiful man who runs the gym and spa whose name escapes me, the porter Dharma who drove us to the airport and who has worked at the Legian since it opened. We had such a wonderful in-depth discussion about yourself and your culture. You apologised for your English but your heart and warmth was all the communicating we needed. I want to also commend the beautiful young man with the incredible smile who was in charge of keeping the toilets by the pool areas impeccable. Thank you so much.

I also want to say that I ate at many of the wonderful recommended restaurants throughout the area and the dining is amazing. But my favourite meal and setting above all else was the night we ate at the Legian and tried the Head Chef Luke’s DISCOVERY menu. To say I was in food heaven was an understatement.

Finally a big thank you to the General Manager, Kevin J Abramowicz. You absolutely do exceed your guests expectations and the generosity of spirit goes a long way. Even the use of the Hospitality Suite on what is a very long day when check out is 12.00pm and your flight leaves at 11.00pm was so appreciated and I want to thank you again for what you did for us on our final day. To be seen off personally by you when we left was pretty special. Thank you again. We’ll be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1299,Fantastic!,50,August 2014,"Fantastic experience, great unobtrusive staff, simple check in, great breakfast that lasts you all day and tea is served at 4 pm, beautiful rooms. Did not want to leave, and will definitely return. Late check out was not possible but a great day room was provided for a shower prior to leaving.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1300,Outstanding Customer Service,50,September 2014,"My husband and I experienced the ultimate in customer service from Kevin and every other member of The Legian staff. They greet you by name, with a smile and a genuine regard for your positive experience. The accommodations were perfect - great room, location, views. Food was great with an amazing breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. Afternoon tea was a nice treat, as well. Morning beach yoga was offered daily. The concierge service (thanks, Verina!) coordinated a wonderful snorkeling day trip (most beautiful coral and fishes!) and a customized sightseeing tour with our personal driver (thanks, Agus!) Truly a relaxing and memorable experience. We highly recommend the Legian. Can't wait to return. Nicely done, Kevin. Please thank your team.

1301,Appalling treatment of guests at The Legian Bali,10,September 2014,"We walked into this venue from the Beach and asked if they were open for Breakfast, as we have done with many other fine establishments on this beach - great service from others such as Ku De Ta, La Lucciola etc. The Legian said yes they were open for us to have breakfast then proceeded with appalling treatment of paying guests. First they named a price for the Buffett Breakfast which we accepted (15 US $ - ) then asked where we wanted to sit, we said non-smoking they sat us in Smoking saying they didn't have any other tables available (there were only about 6 other guests there so about 20 free other tables!). Then they came back apologised for having quoted the wrong price and doubled the price of the Buffet ($30 US $) again we accepted. They then came back, welcomed us to their establishment for the third time and added that we would need to hurry with our breakfast because they were so busy they would need this table very quickly! Clearly at this point we said we were not happy to eat here and left. This is the worst treatment I have ever received in Bali and wanted to warn other guests of this.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1302,Simple - perfection,50,September 2014,"Recently stayed at The Legian on a stopover back from the Gili Islands before heading back to Europe.

What can I say - having stayed in several other luxury hotels in Asia, Europe and North America, this one definitely stood out.

Although this was my first stay at The Legian and I only stayed for one night, I got upgraded and was greeted personally by the General Manager on my arrival. All staff were super attentive, friendly and helpful during my stay, from checking in to the airport transfer the next day.

The room was very spacious with a great view over the pool area and the beach. Dinner and breakfast in the restaurant were superb - very large selection and everything prepared to an extremely high standard.

I was very impressed during my stay and will definitely come back in the future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1303,Best ever experience,50,August 2014,"I have travelled to The Legian hotel several times over the years and what a wonderful experience it has been every time
But in August 2014 the staff and hotel have exceeded themselves
The service from check in to pool side service were truly outstanding
What a wonderful job Kevin has done
My husband and I truly enjoyed every aspect of this luxurious hotel
The staff can't do enough and the executive chef Luke Macleod couldn't have been more brilliant

What a wonderful hotel and will be back in a heart beat
You run the best hotel in Asia
Thanks for having us
The Hendels",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1304,Our best holiday so far,50,September 2014,"Not much more to say that has not already been said.
All other reviews are 100% spot on.

Every single thing was perfect. From private transport and check-in experience all the way to late checkout.
Resort itself is well maintained, area is peaceful and protected from outside noises yet close to all the action if needed.
Pool area always have free daybeds or chairs, and pools themselves are spotless.

Food during the breakfast and lunch was delicious and fresh.

There were some kids around because I saw them during the breakfast,
but we heard no kids at all during the day or around the pool. I am super grateful for that.

Super king size bed, Bose speakers everywhere (even in bathroom), daily turn-down service (the best one we have experienced so far) are all just additional bonus points.

But really, one thing that can make or break your holiday is the staff. And they definitely deserve a separate mention here I believe.

It really feels like they want to be there and that they want to assist you.
We have not seen a single person frowning or looking bored or annoyed.
Everywhere (and I mean everywhere) around the resort you meet staff that will smile and say hello.
In restaurants and around the pool you just put down the menu and someone will stand there waiting for your order.
If you need to ask anything, someone will be around to answer.

Amazing thing is that all of this is achieved without being over the top and in your face.

In closing, amazing place and we will be back soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1305,"The perfect honeymoon location, the perfect hotel",50,September 2014,"We had a villa for five days and our stay here was idyllic, beyond all expectations. Every single member of staff knew our names, made us feel special and there were too many neat personal touches to mention but we felt sad leaving.

Special mention must go to our personal butler Agus who seemed appear out of nowhere at every moment to provide advice and assistance without ever once feeling intrusive. In fact, he helped make arrangements for later in our holiday with boat and car transfers to Ubud and the Gili Islands all sorted.

The hotel and it's grounds has an ambience of tranquility and calm. The trio if infinity pools set in
Landscaped grounds overlooking the beach were pure eye candy. A night spent at W Hotel nearby was a complete contrast - impersonal, shallow, style over substance. The Legian has style, substance, service and a smile. So glad we chose to come to Bali and specifically to the Legian to kick start our honeymoon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1306,What a real treat we had there...,50,September 2014,"My family and I returned to The Legian after many years.
I have always liked the feeling of this place... I was very pleased to see that it has remained an amazing place.
Service is excellent, staff very friendly and efficient, place is very very well kept, not to forget the delicious food from breakfast, pool, to dinner.
Spa treatments were amazing
It s was a very last minute week end for my husband s birthday...
Amongst all the hotel you have in Bali, and we ve been to many nice hotels there, the decision was not easy...but I am very please to said that The Legian full filled all the expectations for that special occasion.
We will definitely go back again..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1307,Simply the best,50,August 2014,"Where else can you float in the pool, elbows resting on the side and feel the surf spray on your face. See guests reading or lazing under palm trees, visitors walking on the beach or like me mesmerized just staring out to the ocean.
The breakfasts are superb, lunches and afternoon teas just special, and I don't know why we had not had dinner at the hotel before, we certainly will in future, the barramundi was amazing. The staff are simply the best, efficient polite jovial, the life guard even kept an eye on us as we headed for a swim. Close to all the Trendy restaurants coffee shops and boutiques, the hotel was so beautiful I didn't want to step outside. We have stayed before, this time for 10 days, and I keep thinking it just can't get any better, BUT IT DOES. Can't wait to go back again thank you to everybody at The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1308,"Brilliant & Outstanding Hotel in Bali, Indonesia.",50,September 2014,"If there is any place you want to be in Bali to stay, well hands down..
this is ""the place"". I have been here like more'n 7 times and has never felt enough as I want to come here on my next hols.. What I like most about this beautiful property is that it's waves are voicing in your ears all the time even while you're asleep, the staffs are very friendly and respectful.. even the rooms are splendid and comfortable beyond expected because of their layouts with the famous Seminyak beach just a few steps away from your room. The breakfast ""are to die for.."" (according to my daughters) !
But most of all they try very hard without us realising to please us..
This is my best hotel (to be) for me especially to holiday with family..
I urge you to try for a night at least whenever you're in Bali - it is simply awesome..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1309,Superb!,50,August 2014,"We have spent a good ten days at The Legian. The suite was spacious and nicely spots at the ocean. We are lucky that the interior design is from the designer we like very much. Simple and elegant regional style. The dinners we had at the hotel were excellent. Chef Luke was very creative and original on the menu. The sightseeing tour to Bedugul is highly recommended, however, maybe not the Tanah Lot Temple, unless you don’t mind to be surrounded by lots of tourists.
The service of the hotel is among the top of many five star hotels we have been. It has been very thorough and gracious. We had warm attendance from Kevin, the G.M. at the hotel and his team. I was amazed that staff can address us by name. We are very pleased by the whole experience and certainly hope to be back again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1310,Beautiful hotel...Outstanding service,50,August 2014,"We stayed at the legian for 3 nights and it was amazing. The property is beautiful, the restaurant, pool, the view from everywhere and the suite is lovely but what makes the difference here is the service. Each and every person was exceptionally kind, nice and helpful. Everyone remembers your name
and come to assist you all the time. Best service I've ever had. A must stay in Bali!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1311,"One word ""Amazing""",50,August 2014,"We have spent 3 weeks touring Bali and Lombok and quite simply staying at The Legian Bali was The Pinnacle. We checked in last Sunday and leave this afternoon which is Thursday. The resort is so good we have not been tempted at all to leave the property!

Rooms our suite was very well comfortable with everything you need!

The Restaurant is sublime - the menu designed by the resident Executive Chef Luke MacLeod is delicious, a fabulous blend of Asian Fusion and enough to keep you satisfied for dinner for at least 18 days. If you go there and are a foodie splash out and enjoy the ""Discover tasting menu""!

The location is on the Seminyak beach, listen to the surf by day, dip into the pools, take a Spa treatment and then watch the sunset.

The service is incredible not only are the staff really friendly (common across the whole of Bali) but their professionalism is an absolute credit to the hotel manager Kevin Abramowicz, the balance is spot on, non intrusive but well anticipated when required!

This is a fantastic hotel, we felt well looked after and very relaxed in a great environment with great food. The hotel deserves it's high trip advisor ranking and comes with my HIGHEST Recommendation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1312,Excellent luxury hotel,50,August 2014,"We stayed at the Legian for 4 nights in August 2014, we are a family of 4 with 2 kids 6 & 9.
We had a fantastic 2 bedroom apartment (#313) that is huge with 2 huge bedrooms, 2 huge bahrooms with shower and bathtub, a living room, dining area, entrance, pantry and terrace.
The linens and amenities are excellent a very nice touch is that coffee nespresso, soft drinks, bottled water and snacks are included as well as wifi.
The breakfast buffet is of the highest standard as well the service.
The restaurant is very good, service superb, would have liked the possibility of eating more simple things.
Pool area is great, towels for the deck chairs as well as ice water are provided immediately.
The beach is not appealing to me but this is just the way the beaches are in south Bali, has nothing to do with the hotel.
Spa and gym are great, very pleasant the yoga classes free twice daily with a very professional instructor.
Gardens, pools and overall ambience are all very beautiful and extremely elegant without being excessive.
Staff is all exceptional in all areas and departments, you really are pampered and spoilt.
For us a truly memorable experience which made our stay in Bali very pleasant notwithstanding that we did not enjoy Bali because of the terrible traffic, all the stores and bars.
I would definitely return to the Legian I would not return to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1313,spotless service,50,August 2014,"Excellent Hotel!!!. Food, accommodation and service worth the price. We were absolutely pleased with our stay there. Looking forward to return to Bali and stay at The Legian again. Service makes it different and better than other hotels five stars",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1314,Top Notch !,50,August 2014,"We stayed here for 2 nights and found the experience thoroughly enjoyable and impressive. The staff are very attentive, helpful yet discreet and they never failed to greet us with a smile and greetings whenever we pass them by which is very endearing and showed a great hospitality culture in the hotel. While laying on a large beach sofa waiting for the sunset, we ordered chicken wings and fish and chips, they are so delicious we ordered second portion, this also apply to other foods we ate at breakfast. The housekeeping staff clean thr room twice a day and their work is impressive and immaculate. Top Notch rating for The Legian, keep us the excellent work.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1315,"Best hotel in Bali, as usual",50,May 2014,"A bit late for this feed back.
It was our 9th stay at The Club at The Legian, in may. This time we decided to stay only in one hotel for a long time : 3 weeks at The Club.
What to say ? How good it is to unpack and to feel at home. The Club is fantastic, all the team is wonderful and make you happy every second. The service at its best. Our Villa was very good, however the current refurbishment is welcome. Our butler was an angel for us and our birthday party was more than memorable.
The main hotel is at the top. We love the beach and the staff there. The food is much better than in the past with the new Chef. A wonderful menu. You MUST join the seafood BBQ on fridays. The all staff was incredible. Try the french toasts and the breakfast sorbets.
We are lucky to spend a lot of time in 5 stars resorts around the world. This one is clearly our favorite, as its balance of service, location and atmosphere is perfect.
Can not wait to go back next year.

No discussion about it, this is the best hotel of Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1316,Relax and recharge,50,June 2014,"We spent a week at the Legian in late June. Had not been to Bali before. Met at the airport, straight through customs and immediate transfer to the hotel - perfect start ! And it just got better. Excellent accommodation - a suite overlooking the gardens and beach. Perfect breakfast area, pool, gym and day beds.....really little if any reason to leave the hotel. Great staff, nothing too much trouble, and the food was very good.
One thing my son and I enjoyed was afternoon tea - while the others were doing something else we would move the 15 yards from the day beds to the beach cabana to enjoy afternoon tea and a few colds beers and let the time drift by.
If you want to head out - not really necessary - some excellent restaurants are close by. Very peaceful, will definitely return - recommended !!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1317,A truly exceptional hotel,50,August 2014,"Having read a number of very positive reviews about this hotel we arrived with a concern that the reality might fall short of expectation. This concern was very quickly allayed. From the moment we arrived we were treated as honoured guests. Each and every member of staff couldn't have been more attentive, helpful or pleasant. Every staff member addressed us by name from the moment we arrived acknowledging us at every turn and taking care to ensure all our needs we're met. The suite we occupied was also truly outstanding with regional furnishings of exceptional standard and a double balcony overlooking the pools, beach and open sea. The catering was also of the highest standard with a good choice of local and European dishes. The local town was sufficient in scale to provide interest albeit with limited choices for eating and entertainment. We did however visit Tanah Lot, one of the most important temples on the island, the Elephant Lodge where we fed, rode and dined with the elephants and took a tour hour whitewater rafting trip, all of which are highly recommended. You certainly won't be disappointed should you decide to visit this exceptional hotel! Kevin, the General Manager and his welcoming staff will, I'm sure, ensure you have a truly memorable stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1318,Return To Heaven,50,August 2014,"Returned to the legian in August for a family holiday.This was our 6th stay at the legian and we were not disappointed.
it is like returning home
we stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and we were very happy with our beautiful suite and the hotel. the service is outstanding from beginning till end-and we were sad to leave.
we enjoyed a delicious breakfast every morning which consisted of fresh fruits yoghurts and the like, followed by eggs of our choice-waffles pancakes pastries-all bought to us at the table,fresh juices and excellent coffee-overlooking the gorgeous pool and beach .We then sat by the stunning pool/beach not moving till sunset.We ate lunch everyday at the pool restaurant which has wide variety of food to choose from with excellent service. water , face washers and face spray provided continuously throughout the day plus little treats like sorbets, and afternoon tea is served from 4 pm .
the staff around the pool provide excellent service turning chairs,refreshing towels when you get up to have a swim, and refilling your water.
although this is a pricey hotel its well worth the price. the service, the position of the hotel close to shopping and all the popular restaurants, and the beach.
Thankyou Kevin and your amazing staff for looking after us so well-we cant wait to return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1319,Lovely hotel,50,June 2014,"This is a lovely hotel. We spent a week here as part of our honeymoon. The suit was huge and the location was perfect – within easy walking distance of the shops and bars but far enough away to not be disturbed by them. All the staff and the GM were very friendly and the service was excellent.
If I had one criticism it would be that it is promoted as being family friendly but there is no kids club. Our six year old daughter really liked this at our previous hotel as it meant that she could get out of the sun in the middle of the day and play with friends she had made in the shade.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1320,Just perfect,50,August 2014,"Excellent service. The staff is extremely friendly, present but discreet. The view on the beach and the pool is just stunning, especially as it comes with comfortable sofas and big pillows. Much appreciated were the small complementary amenities and the afternoon tea!. Very close to the city center.
One of the few hotels we would come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1321,Not quite as spectacular second time around,40,July 2014,"We first visited the Club at the Legian a few years ago, and decided to revisit it as part of a chill out trip to Bali.
First, the plus points.
- The service was as excellent as we remembered. Both our butler and the staff at the Club Lounge could not have been more helpful, and went out of their way to make sure we were looked after. I got sick while there (in no way a result of anything eaten at the Legian by the way!) and the guys took me to the pharmacy and even gave me some rehydration drinks. Thank you!
- We used the main pool this time, and it is an amenity worth using if you want to swim rather than just cool down; about 30 metres long and pretty much deserted most of the time.
- The location is excellent, really easy to get to both the beach and the Seminyak strip for evenings out.
- The complimentary car service is very helpful for evenings out.
- Having a private pool villa is great - you can get away from the noise and bustle of the town and beach.
- Complimentary Wi-Fi - take note, other 5 star chains!

Downside -
- Maybe we were just unlucky in the villa we were given this time, but it was in need of refurbishment. The sinks in the bathroom were cracked and the tiles in the bathroom needed replacing - all in all just a bit shabby which doesn't sit too well at these prices. It is also one of the nearest villas to the main areas, so we spent our last day with two guys overlooking our garden while they replaced a fence nearby. Completely understand that this needs to be done, but it wasn't great.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1322,our home in paradise,50,August 2014,"This hotel is just outstanding!!! And I should say outstanding in every aspect, especially the people.. We just love the people there.. starting from the GM, Kevin, and all his staffs, they are just very nice, friendly, helpful and resourceful. It seems that everybody is willing to give their best to serve you. I should say we were treated like a family, and that really made us fell at home.. Our home in paradise.

l should also say that we've been lucky enough to experience some of the best hotels in the world. But I must say this hotel is different. You would get that 'homey' feeling and you would also feel that you are surrounded by your family.
Even compare to the old The Legian two years back, we feel that this time the Legian is much better in terms of its services, rooms, pools, etc. Even though this time it is more expensive compare to 2 years back, but it is worth every penny of it.

I would like to thank Kevin and all his staffs who we cannot name one by one. You guys are doing a wonderful job.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1323,The perfect holiday,50,August 2014,"We fwlt very welcome from the very beginning. On the nice meet the management- cocktail we also met other guest for nice conversations. Wonderful food, and extremely attentive and friendly staff. The concierge was very helpful with restaurant reservations, also on fully booked places. Very good gym as well. And of course a magic setting on the beach with stunning pools.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1324,The closest place to heaven we have found,50,August 2014,"Before I start, I will admit I have been lucky enough to stay at some of the finest hotels in the world as both part of my work and pleasure.

We got married last year at Capella Pedegral in Cabo, Mexico which is known as one of the finest resorts in the world. We booked our honeymoon at The Club at The Legian and were hoping it would match up.

The Club at a The Legian is in a different league to Capella and everywhere else we have been lucky enough to stay in.

From the moment we arrived to the second we left we were utterly spoilt in every single way. Our Butler, Hendra, was introduced to us on arrival (at 11.30am) and from that moment onwards we simply did not lift a finger for 6 wonderful nights.

We had cars take and collect us from the best restaurants in Seminyak (and were given the best tables in every single one of them).

The food at The Legian was truly exceptional. We ate at the main hotel restaurant on our first night which was magical with food that you could only dream of experiencing in Perth. We had breakfast and lunch each day either in the Club or the main hotel and it was always of the highest quality.

In summary, staying at The Club at The Legian is not cheap but it is worth every penny.

Huge thanks and congratulations to Kevin (the GM who regrettably we did not meet) but more so to Hendra and the entire Club team who showed us how things could be done.

We are already planning our trip back in August next year.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1325,Best,50,July 2014,"Unexpected room size (very spacious), great rooms. Complimentary items were a wonderful added bonus, soft drinks in room, waters, afternoon tea etc. Wifi facilities everywhere in the hotel. The entire hotel complex is well laid out and the grounds are beautiful. All the staff that we dealt with were exceptionally great at what they did. Having requested an airport pickup and drop off gave us access to the staff at the airport that assisted with arrival and departure. Their presence took away the stress of finding your way around. Ocean is warm but there is an undertow that could be dangerous, however the hotel has lifeguards who are always watching the guests. We all enjoyed swimming in the ocean and using the pools which were great.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1326,Nice hotel with an exotic touch,50,July 2014,"This is by far one of the best hotels I've stayed in the Asia Pacific region. We stayed in a room with excellent view of the Seminyak beach and I love the infinity pool there. The hotel is very well maintained and with top notch services. Although the rooms are a little on the pricey side but most of the stuff are included in the rates (even the snacks and beverages in the mini bar) so there's little extra you need to pay unless of course, if you go for the exotic spa and massage which was unbelievably nice and relaxing. The only thing i don't like is that water in the shower is a mixture of fresh and sea water which leaves you a sticky feeling even after you've had a shower, but i guess it's the same with the other hotels / resorts in the area, you just have to get used to it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1327,Perfect end of our honeymoon,50,July 2014,"We have traveled extensively around the world and this was the best resort we have ever experienced! Our butler 'Juni' was fantastic from her greeting us at check in and introducing us to our villa-home for the next several days.

The private pool, canapés and drinks upon arrival were fantastic. Very comfortable bed and plush surroundings down to the Acqua Da Parma bath products and the Bose multi-room surround sound system.

The in-villa bar was a fantastic touch as well. We'll be back and will recommend to everyone. It was a little slice of heaven,",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1328,Location location location ... & it's team!,50,July 2014,"We had 7 nights in a spacious 1b suite, with large balcony looking out towards the ocean. Mind you we never used the balcony. Day beds by the pools/beach was our home for most of our stay. Loving having dips in the pool, relaxing looking out to the ocean & seeing my 4yr old learn to swim.

The grounds are stunningly kept, the rooms were always kept clean and ALL staff at The Legian was tremendously helpful, friendly and non obtrusive to ensure our stay was heaven!

Breakfast had the right selections of both al carte & buffet. Lunch & dinner menu had a good variety also.

This resort is located across the road from the walkway to Seminyak Square and 'Eat Street'.

In summary, I wish I could live here however must get back to reality. Having said that, my only wish is for Kevin & his team do something about Jetstar's ridiculous 11pm flight home :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1329,The perfect getaway!,50,January 2014,"We travelled to Bali on a family holiday and we're delighted that we chose The Legian. The hotel and grounds are beautiful with a stunning garden and pool area leading down to a sandy beach. The staff are faultless - the service throughout the hotel is excellent and pool/beachside service is exemplary and not intrusive. The breakfast was very popular with our family with a vast selection of food available. Dinner was delicious. We had two one bedroom suites for four of us which were very spacious and had lovely views of the garden, pool and beach. The location is great within an easy walk of Seminyak market and shops and close to some superb local restaurants. The concierge staff were really efficient and booked all our restaurants for us before our arrival and arranged drivers etc as required. Would definitely return. Highly recommend.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1330,The best holidays we had!!!,50,July 2014,"Is 100% perfect in every singles way, I love the place, the area, the staff everything.
Many congratulations to the General Manager Mr. Kevin Abramovick for a fantastic great job and his brilliant staff.
I would like to mention everyone for making our holidays so beautiful, but especially, to our Butler
Merta what a professional : )
Merci, Gracias, Thank you Merta.
Henra great job too.
Astika the best driver we ever had, very polite and informative always.
Suma, to you all Thank you",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1331,"Balinese graciousness, Swiss precision. A++++",50,June 2014,"PERFECT location with huge expansive length of gorgeous beachfront, not a tiny wedge like some newer places (W). Staff could not possibly be better, attentive and genuinely interested in making your stay perfect. Housekeeping is exceptional as is wait staff, front desk and every other department. Kevin Abramowicz is the GM and works for GHM, the Swiss company that manages the Legian. Kevin is a very smart guy, a real pro and runs the place with great attention to detail. He doesn't just make the rounds shaking hands, he wants to know how your stay is and if anything can be done to make it better. You can tell he truly cares ands wants to run a truly exceptional property. His number 2, Rohan shares his boss's attributes and genuine concern for guests. Kevin and Rohan listen to guests and act. I had a tiny suggestion for improving the morning juice serving cooling and it was changed at once. Rooms are huge and all have ocean views as far as I can tell. The food is excellent and a new Exec Chef, Luke McLeod, is showing some major culinary talent here. The place runs like a Swiss watch, everything works, nothing needs attention, no deferred maintenance, everything is spotless. Its not an inexpensive hotel but it delivers solid value. I will definitely return. Thanks to Kevin, Rohan, Luke and all the wonderful staff members at the Legian Bali for giving us a stay that was perfect in every respect. Sampai jumpa lagi!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1332,"Great location, flawless personal service",50,July 2014,"My husband and I brought our 16 months old toddler to stay at the Legian for 5 nights. My first impression was, considering the Legian is not a new hotel, the place and the grounds are very well kept and very clean. It doesn't feel dated at all. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. The room is spacious, with a separate living/ dining area, separate pantry area with a minibar stocked with a selection of complimentary bottled water, juices and soft drinks, Nespresso machine, fruits, etc. I appreciated the separate pantry area with its big kitchen sink and counter top, as traveling with a toddler, I find myself forever boiling water, washing and drying water bottles and feeding equipment.
It was also convenient to have a second guest toilet in the living room. The bedroom itself and the master bathroom are also spacious, and we fit the daughter's cot next to our bed with plenty of room to spare.
The room has a big balcony, overlooking the beachfront, which fit a big day bed for lounging around in, and a small dining table.
There's also an iPod dock and sound system with an iPod preloaded with tons of music, in case you forget to bring your own.
So if you are traveling with an energetic wandering toddler like us, this room is the perfect size.
The service in the hotel was excellent- often, we find that in resorts in SE Asia, generally service is great but tends to be more relaxed and slow. Here, the service was prompt and efficient. The staff were ever helpful and very personal. They make an effort to address you by name, be it at the poolside, in the restaurant, at the spa, or at the reception. Service is prompt and efficient- first night of arrival, we must have called housekeeping like 6 times, (where's the baby cot's mosquito net/ where's the mosquito repellent/ we don't have enough mosquito electric mats/ we don't have enough mineral water etc etc.) and each time they came to our door within minutes. On the note of housekeeping, I must say they did a very good job everyday. We had A LOT of stuff in the room, but everything was meticulously folded, tidied, stacked, even the toddler's (dirty) laundry and toys. They also noticed that we used bottled water very quickly, and automatically started providing more bottles without us asking. I've always found that the best kind of housekeeping is the kind that discreetly notes your preferences.
The hotel has only 1 restaurant, but that was ok with us, since there were tons of great restaurants nearby in Seminyak, which we could easily get to with the helpful hotel car services. The hotel is also located near tons of little shops, in case you want to take a stroll and do some shopping. The breakfast buffet and menu selection at the restaurant is good and has something to suit everyone's tastes. The only comment would be, perhaps the restaurant needs a few more highchairs given there were quite a few babies when we stayed there, and sometimes it took a while for them to find a spare high chair. Also it might have been helpful to perhaps have some plastic baby cutlery/ bowls/ cups to offer.
The spa was easy to book and service was very good as well. There's also a gym, but we didn't try that out. We spent too much time lounging by the 3 beachfront swimming pools. Pool attendants are very friendly and helpful. They tided our cabana every time we went into the pool.
The GM Kevin is ever present to deal with any problems or questions, and he always pops out at the right moment to have a friendly chat with you.
All in all, we were impressed by the efficient, flawless service at this hotel, and the location was great. We would definitely come back again next time we visit Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1333,Amazing!,50,July 2014,"Not sure whether this is the right place to leave a comment. Anyway I cannot find a better place to leave a good review. This is a very high standard restaurant. I had my dinner in The Pavilion. It is a couple seat oversee Indian Ocean. Besides, there will be a private chef together with a private waiter to serve you only. I proposed to my girlfriend during the dinner. I believe part of the credits belong to this restaurant because the food is outstanding as well as the romantic atmosphere. I have to give a high rating to The Legian because they are outstanding in terms of service and food standard.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1334,"Amazing place, fantastic staff",50,July 2014,"I've stayed at the Legian six times, my family come every odd year and we absolutely love it. The staff are fantastic, in sticking with the culture of Bali all the staff are locals and obviously love their jobs and this is reflected in their service. One staff member Wiyan saandi, I have gotten to know over my stays and we have been friends ever since. I've stayed in the main area only and although the villas are fantastic the view from the main area is breathtaking. I would rate this as one of the best 5 star hotels in the world.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1335,Luxury in Bali,40,July 2014,"My first trip to Bali and wow what a place to stay at The Club at The Legian.

The villa was simply stunning, with its own pool and gardens. Service coundn't be better with your own butler there to assist to all needs. Its the first time I've been on holiday and gone back home with no washing to do !

The hotel restaurant, bar and spa were exceptional and supported lots of other choice locally which the staff were happy to book for us.

Nothing at all negative to say and would highly recommend to anyone thinking about a relaxing, luxurious and romantic stay in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1336,A private sanctuary,40,July 2014,"We spent 8 days at the Legian Club, the private villas attached to the Legian Hotel. Although part of the property, they're located on the other side of the road (away from the beach) to the main hotel. We were in two minds about this. On the one hand we had a large and luxurious 1 bedroom villa with our own pool in a lovely garden setting, however, we did feel a bit isolated from the main action of the hotel. Although all the usual amenities are offered in the villa complex - breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails, etc, we always went across the road to the main hotel to enjoy these and so did most of the other villa guests. This gave the villa complex a very quiet atmosphere, lacking in any buzz and added to making it feel isolated. The villas are ideal if you truly want privacy. We enjoyed this aspect and the ability to join the holiday makers at the hotel when and if we wanted.

The villas are very nice although a little dark, the glass doors have wooden screens that cut out the light and the view to the pool and surrounding garden. The small garden and pool area is lovely with outdoor seating and day beds. We spent most of our days lounging around by our private pool.

One of the most negative aspects of the Legian (hotel and villas) is the rock hard bed. It was like sleeping on a slab of concrete. The management were kind enough to try to remedy this by adding a feather pillow top to the mattress (having these on hand suggests that many other guests have had the same issue) but even two of these did not stop me from waking up with a sore back and neck. The bed really took the shine of our otherwise enjoyable experience at the Legian.

The location of the hotel is excellent, surrounded by some great restaurants and beach clubs. The service is also excellent. We had a very late flight and were given a very late check out to accommodate this, the staff do go out of their way to ensure you have the best experience. The food (we only had the buffet breakfast and a couple of room service lunches) was also very good. Overall we enjoyed the Legian Club villa. If you want privacy and prefer to have your own pool and garden rather than a room with a view of the ocean, then you'll likely enjoy the Legian Club.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1337,Cool vibe in Seminyak,50,July 2014,"The Legian is a great choice for Seminyak: close to all of the bustle and attractions, but once you enter the resort it has a nice, relaxed, cool feeling.
The rooms, restaurants, spa, are all you could ask for. But the personal level of service is amazing. This is my third visit to the Legian and I eagerly await a return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1338,Overpriced and ageing,40,June 2014,"We had a first floor room at the end of the property that was supposed to have ocean and sunset views. We could see the ocean through the trees but the sunset was completely obscured. The rooms are very nice but starting to show their age. The staff and hotel location are excellent although they do take advantage financially. $7.50 for a beer that you can get on the beach for $2.
Nice hotel, great location, overpriced and ageing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1339,Luxurious cosy hotel with excellent & kind service,50,July 2014,"Beautiful cosy hotel, perfect location, excellent restaurant, super kind staff, perfect Spa, excellent Beach & pool service. Children friendly.
We stayed for 1 week with our children (9-11y). Perfect holiday!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1340,Almost perfect,40,July 2014,"These are just little niggles but here we go: the toilet cubicle in the main bathroom had an accumulation of hairs in the corners - I requested reception to sort but no action. Granted the hairs were difficult to see on the stone floor but grossed me out all the same. Secondly, the rooms are so dark - I had no light to do my makeup - perhaps a dimmer switch ? They kindly brought a portable mini light immediately. Everything else is delightful.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1341,What a Place!,50,July 2014,"This is one of the best kept secrets around. Continues to be the best experiences we have when traveling as a family. Repeat guests; 10+ times. Quiet, beachfront, lush green surrounds, great spot to relax!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1342,Amazing!,50,August 2013,Apologies for this way overdue review. I traveled here in the spring/summer of 2013 and stayed in one of the private villas. The property has the main hotel building right at beachfront and the quiet villas across the street. By far the best place I have ever had the pleasure of staying. Outstanding service thanks to our butler. Gorgeous place. And very quiet and comfortable place to relax and enjoy. The hotel goes out of their way to ensure you are always happy. I plan on visiting Bali again and would definitely look forward to staying at this amazing place.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1343,Best luxury hotel in Bali ... by far!,50,June 2014,"This property is set amid beautifully manicured lawns and right on the ocean, a fantastic location with the restaurants and shops of Seminyak all within walking distance.
The suites are very spacious and stylishly designed, the level of service is unbeatable and the food is fantastic! This hotel ""oozes"" luxury and charm ... a very well run property indeed!
Many thanks to the management and staff for another wonderful holiday at The Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1344,beautiful resort,50,July 2014,"Our family of 4, 2 adults and one teenager one adult child stayed here for 5 nights. We stayed in a 2 bedroom ocean view room on the first floor. We all loved this hotel. Located right in the middle of Seminyak we could walk to lots of places which is great due to the bad traffic. THe staff were uniformly wonderful. We didn't eat at the hotel apart from Breakfast which was good without being fantastic. We ate lunch and dinner out. The pools are beautiful and despite being school holidays and heaps or families with small children there is room enough for everyone without being on top of each other. Would definatley recommend.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1345,family holiday,50,July 2014,"Absolutely amazing from the food to the service
stayed in sunset suite
restaurant was amazing and the views at night were out of a story book
the kids stayed in the kids club and the 3 pools were so kids friendly",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1346,Fantastic Hotel,50,July 2014,My daughter and J stayed six nights at the Legian and found it heavenly. The hotel and staff are superior with incredible attention to detail. We had a deluxe room that was spacious and immaculate. Loved every minute if our stay and the service around the pool area is outstanding. Well done!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1347,Superb Hotel,50,June 2014,"I visited with my mom and we stayed here for three nights before moving to their sister property in Ubud. I have stayed at 2 other hotels along the beach in Bali and this is by far the best. The rooms are large and the staff is the best. The location is fantastic, being able to walk to some restaurants and shops. The stretch of beach in front of the hotel is very good, which is not always the case in Bali. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening and the food and atmosphere were excellent. The breakfast included in the room room is also very good with a lot of variety. We were greeted by the GM at checking and check out and I was quite happy to see him about the hotel at times! ensuring every was running smoothly. I would make this hotel my first pick if I return to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1348,"THE place to stay in Seminyak, Bali.",50,July 2014,"We arrived at the resort about 9 pm on Sunday 6th July after being picked up at the airport by the hotel’s limousine. The drive to the resort took about 25 minutes. Check in was quick with scented cold towels, ginger with citronella cold drinks, and we were then shown around the hotel’s facilities, even at this late hour. We originally booked a Studio Suite but were upgraded to the 110 square metres One Bedroom Deluxe Suite, of which there are fourteen, each with two separate outdoor decks for dining and lounging. The resort features 68 suites, and is about 17 years old. It does show it’s age, and although some of the fittings are looking tired, it’s clean and well maintained. Moreover, the complimentary Wi-Fi Internet, Smart LED TV with Blu-Ray DVD player, Bose sound system, iPod dock and Apple Video iPods for guests’ personal use, evokes the feeling of being ‘modern and current’. The high canopied bed with PLOH pillows and luxurious White Goose Linen Duvets ensures good sleep quality. The toilet has a bath tub and a rain shower. There’s a Nespresso coffee machine and capsules, TWG teas, digital weighting machine, hair dryer, and the list goes on. All day, we hear the sound of the pounding waves, reminding us of the close proximity to the sea.
Although advertised are several dining venues: The Restaurant, The Pool Bar and The Ocean Bar, all having views of the Indian ocean, The Restaurant is effectively, the main dining area. There’s yoga, a spa, a gym inside the spa, a gift shop, and the three-tiered swimming pools: the closest to the beach being for adults only as it’s deep and 30 meters long for lap swimming; the other two are for children and fun. A 30 minute drive brings you to the Nirwana Golf Course by the sea, the Umala stables nearby for horse riding on the beach sand.
Breakfast is a generous spread of fruits, juices, cereals, cheese and local fare. Main items are ordered separately. We ate lunch and dinner at the resort and the meals are well prepared and presented. Executive Chef Luke MacLeod whom we met, has more than 15 years’ of international experience working with some of the highly regarded Michelin Star chefs in France. You must try his Wagyu Beef Rendang!
The beach is clean, with medium grained black/brownish sand. The sea was very choppy during our 3 day stay, with the red flag up every day warning of strong undercurrents. A very long stretch of beach allows for ample exercise for the more energetic, and sunsets can be very beautiful depending on the weather and clouds. Indonesian sculptures and indigenous art abound throughout the resort’s public and private spaces, and the gardens though well maintained, could do with a little more intensive and imaginative landscaping. Strangely, I did not see any dragonflies, butterflies or other insects. Only a few birds and one brown squirrel were sighted!
GM Kevin, who looks very youthful, has looked into minute details that not all guests appreciate but that does makes the Legian stand out from the rest. Besides calling you by name, greetings and smiles all around, remembering your preferences, etc. the coffee is served with fresh warm aerated milk in a small container, the butter in chilled brass containers, and waiters ask permission before topping up your drinks. Women attendants in white uniform are available as a service to look out for the children around the pool. The level of attention and meticulous customer service is difficult to fault, and is obviously, a reflexion of the competency and skill of the management.
Situated on Bali’s southern coast, The Legian is within walking distance of Bali’s trendiest shopping and nightlife areas and is the place to stay if you’re visiting Bali’s Seminyak area. Close attention to details is their forte. This resort may be pricey, but as a general rule, you get what you pay for.

Tips.
The resort is not wheel chair friendly.
All rooms face the sea and have some views of the setting sun.
If you need items like toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, sewing kit and comb, you need to request for these and it’s complimentary. This is done on purpose to reduce waste of these products.
If you like quiet in the public areas, e.g. the pool, avoid periods during the school vacation. Otherwise, put up with screaming toddlers and children!
Lot’s of eating places outside the resort, although, the resort itself has an excellent dining menu. Go to Seminyak Square for more shops and eateries, take the short cut. From the hotel, take a left for about 50m, then on the opposite side of the road look for a white on blue “Polo” sign board. Turn right after this at another sign that says “To Seminyak Square 200m”.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1349,the best hotel I have stayed in,50,May 2014,"We returned from our holiday at the Legian 5 weeks ago, we still cannot believe what a wonderful hotel this is. The best hotel we have stayed in. Ever. Memories include fabulous room, amazing staff, amazing food (especially the intimate BBQ), luxury and relaxation. Back to work and wishing we were there. Thanks to Kevin, Rohaan and Luke.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1350,amazing abode with superior service,50,June 2014,"Stayed with a friend who flew in for a few days of project scouting from Europe. Probably one of the best Hotel experiences in a long time. Impeccable service, anticipating each and every need, wonderful pools, amazing breakfast and unbeatable sunset views.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1351,Deserving of tripadvisor #1,50,July 2014,"A fantastic establishment with an attention to detail.

The standard ""studio"" is very large.

Food on campus is excellent and all the staff are wonderful. Communication (which can be an issue in English around Bali) is never a problem and the amenities are wonderful

A nice touch: all soft drinks and water is replenished daily, and is complimentary.

The whole experience from check in and until check out is top notch.

A tip: when the hotel contacts you after booking and offers assisted visa and baggage service as well as airport transfer... DO IT. As you are out of the airport within minutes while others are queing forever to get their passport stamped.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1352,Perfect Honeymoon Destination!,50,December 2013,"We stayed at the Legian for our honeymoon and had the most amazing experience! We stayed in a private villa but we found ourselves enjoying the hotel amenities often. Not only is this a beautiful place to stay but the service is incomparable! Everyone knew our names and offered attentive response to our every whim. This is a must-visit location for it's exquisite location, service and 5-star offerings!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1353,In Heaven!,50,August 2013,"Another of my long overdue review but I am in the mood today! We were there last summer for 4 days! We were with 2 other families of which one family is quite a regular! The Legian is the most luxurious hotels we have been. It's one thing to be a 5-star hotel, it's another having the look and atmosphere and the Legian tops it all! We were out a lot but always had breakfast there. It had an excellent spread. But the best part of the place is it's tranquility (fyi, we were there mid-week, no school vaca) and the attention of the staff. They seemed to know which kid belonged to whom and what rooms they were in! I felt that I was safe and in good hands! FYI, if you do visit, don't forget to venture out of Legian grounds. We had some beautiful morning walks in the neighborhood before the streets became busy!.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1354,Seventh Heaven,50,July 2014,"You have to go there to experience the levels of excellence that makes this one of the best resort hotels my family and i have enjoyed. The service and friendliness off all staff was second to none and our two bedroom suite was absolutely stunning and beautifully furnished and very spacious. The swimming pools, proximity to beach and amazing gardens just breathtaking.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1355,Fantastic rooms,40,July 2014,"Went to Bali for a wedding with my wife and infant. Loved the fact it was right on the beach, and the rooms. Very large, lovely bed with canopy and very large bathroom. Loved the swimming pool and service all round was excellent (except 1 guy at concierge / reception who totally got the travel time required to our wedding wrong!)

However, the price for rooms is just not worth it. My wife had stayed at ayana previously which had poorer rooms, but nicer facilities (though not out the beach, but elevated on a cliff). Similarly the food seemed to be good, but not great. There was also only 1 small restaurant on the premises. Breakfast was very well prepared to order, but not a lot of variety. Would i come back? Unlikely",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1356,Flawless Bali Experience,50,June 2014,"We have just stayed for the fourth time in four years at The GHM Legian in Seminyak Bali. This holiday was two adults and two teenagers staying for a week, in a two bedroom, two bathroom suite. Everything about this property and the service it offers guests is so impressive. They picked us up from the airport and booked restaurants all arranged by email.

Our suite was very spacious on the top floor and a kitchenette is useful. They even remembered which herbal teas we drink from the last visit and had them for us.

The position is unbeatable, right on the beach, with boogie boards and surfboards provided for guests. There are three pools, one a deep lap pool which is kept for adults where possible. There are several areas to choose from to sit around the pools, sun/shade, on the grass, even day beds just above the sand.

The Legian is also right in the heart of Seminyak so the best restaurants and shops are a short stroll or taxi ride away.

The breakfast (included in our room rate) had something for everyone and again the setting is beautiful. We had lunch most days by the pool and the Pool Bar at night is again a perfect setting. The Friday night Seafood Dinner looks amazing, but we left that night so did not experience it. We saw them setting up the tables by the beach and the food smelt delicious.

All staff are so polite and nothing is too much trouble. If the Legian can fulfill your request they will.

We have stayed here with extended family, as a couple and with our own family of four. It suits all types of travellers in our opinion.

Can't recommend this Hotel highly enough - it's location, presentation, food and service are of the highest standard.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1357,Consistently outstanding,50,June 2014,"My wife and I who have been regular visitors to Bali since 1998 spent 10 days at the Legian in mid June, our third stay in 2 years. The property and its location is spectacular with large immaculate grounds but only some 66 or so rooms. The guest rooms are spacious, balconys large, breakfast a highlight, restaurant superb. The restaurant staff are engaging and knowledgeable and very friendly. The pool and beach frontage are perfect and we never struggled to get a well located sun bed, and the pool staff are attententive and friendly. Located in the best part of Seminyak, it is surrounded by other great restaurants and eating places. The Legian is a wonderful indulgence that makes it almost impossible to consider staying anywhere else. The Management and staff make every effort to ensure a perfect holiday. Cant wait until next time.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1358,Perfect honeymoon destination..,40,June 2014,"A must must must visit place... great ambience superb hospitality n no words to xpress u just can enjoy n feel the joy..

1359,Fantastic hotel,50,June 2014,"My wife and I had a fantastic four nights. Our room was very spacious and had a nice seating area on the balcony facing the ocean. Food was excellent and the buffet breakfast had plenty of choice. A perfect place to relax and enjoy the pools, beach and ocean close at hand",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1360,Great Hotel with amazing Ocean Views!,50,June 2014,"We spend 1 night here before flying home. Seminyak is great fun for those wanting fun night life and plenty of shopping. The Legian was the perfect place to end our holiday. Stunning rooms - they are huge!! All with ocean views. Great service too. The location is brilliant... a short walk to popular beach bars and not far from town but away from the main hustle and bustle.
Loved it...!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1361,Simply Gorgeous,50,June 2014,"As we leave the Legian for Ubud I felt it necessary to write a review of this gorgeous hotel. They have it absolutely right on all fronts, the environment is gorgeous the staff are so very kind and courteous and the food and drink is simply delicious. The reviews and pictures simply do not do it enough justice... If you want to stay somewhere that makes you feel like a princess (or prince) then I would wholly and absolutely recommend the Legian. Thank you to all staff you made our holiday outstanding.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1362,Committed to Excellence,50,June 2014,"Without doubt, the Management & Staff at The Legian are committed to excellence & service. Incredible how every staff member knew our names from day one of our stay. Rooms are full suites with separate bedroom & living areas with high quality decor and huge balconies. Being a member of Leading Hotels of the World, the reputation certainly lived up to expectations. Great staff, sensational service, stunning location right on the beach....we will be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1363,It's the staff who make this hotel incredible,50,June 2014,"I was a bit skeptical at first to pay $600 a night for a romantic sojourn with my love, but I'm glad I did, it was worth every penny.

We are both well heeled (business) travelers and spoiled by luxury in general but we agreed that this experience was one of the best for both of us in 25 years+ of 5* hotels around the world.

Yes, the grounds are gorgeous, the rooms cavernous & luxurious, the endless pools nice but what really makes the Legian a standout is its' staff.

Everywhere you go there are smiling faces calling you by name from the very first moment. Sure it's a system, but it feels genuine. Nothing seems too much.

The standout member of staff for us was Sutra, the manager of the pool. From 9am till 6pm he has a beaming smile with sparkly eyes and ensures your every whim is catered for. Whatever you pay him GM, it's not enough :-)

Thanks all for an unforgettable experience ! Hope to come back one day.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1364,Perfect,50,June 2014,"Returning to this Hotel for the 12th time since 2007 and after having spent 107 nights there there is still only one word to describe this place- Perfect! The new restaurant and room dining menus certainly encouraged us to eat at the Hotel more than we did in the past. The chicken red curry on the room dining menu was one of the best (and hottest) I have ever eaten. Lots of new faces in the staff who seem highly motivated ( Special mention must go to Henry) Old faces who continue to be a credit to this hotel and raise the level every year are Dayu, Sardita, Adi ,Budi.
Well done Kevin and Team for continuing to make this hotel a place to come back to again and again and.........",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1365,Excellent,50,May 2014,My wife and I stayed here and then at the Chedi Ubud (both part of the same hotel chain). The Legian was perfect - beautifully appointed and outstanding service. My son couldn't fly back to Australia as he picked up a severe stomach bug so the hotel very kindly allowed him to stay in our room overnight - there was no questioning about it on their part nor any extra charge - outstanding in this day and age.The hotel manager took a personal interest in our well being from the moment we arrived. Highly recommended on all fronts.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1366,Semiyaks Best Hotel,50,June 2014,"This is one of the best hotels that we have stayed at, it's the little things that make it different, travel plugs in the room. It's right buy the beach and the shops are in walking distance, so you can have it all here. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the service is exceptional. The food is very good to. Great three level infinity pool. The rooms have a small kitchen and coffee machine, soft drinks are no charge",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1367,Very hard to beat,50,June 2014,"The most friendly service you could ever get, without feeling too intimidating. Whether you wander down the hallway, down by the pool or getting a glass of cocktail; all the waiters/ waitresses will address your Sir name - astonishing! And the most memorable part was, General manager himself standing at the entrance while we were living, and wishing us goodbye!!! We missed the hotel very much",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1368,Simply the best,50,June 2014,"We travelled around Bali for two weeks and stayed in many Hotels around the island. Many of these being 5 star houses but none has the service standard and love for detail as The Legian has.
To our impression this is excellence has many faces but is master minded by the GM Mr. K. Abramowicz. We have never felt so welcome and taken care of.
Besides the outstanding operation the Hotel is located at a perfect spot. The ocean has a nice big swell, the beach and water are clean and the angle of the hotel to the ocean is perfect for amazing sunsets.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1369,Very hard to beat,50,June 2014,"A truly memorable stay disappointing only in its shortness. The whole experience was true 5 star excellence. An establishment perfectly positioned, beautifully appointed, expertly run and well worth staying at again. Excellent food selection, pool facilities and service - little need to leave the hotel really!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1370,superlatives apply - amongst the very best,50,June 2014,"We stayed twice - bookending a tour. We couldn't wait for the second visit following the initial experience. This place is virtually faultless...indeed creating a balanced review is difficult as I couldn't find improvements to suggest.
It starts with the people. Staff are amazing. How do they manage to address you by name? The welcome is sincere. The friendliness genuine. It starts from the top with personal welcome and farewell from the GM.
The suites are great. Both of ours were different but brilliant. 433 and 323. The rooms have wonderful facilities....comfortable beds of course...big balcony(ies...323 had 2). Lovely big bathrooms...always nice to have your bath with floating flowers on arrival. Acqua Di Parma toiletries are a touch of class.
The 3 tier pool is both big/functional and very pretty - the infinity style works really well against the sea.
Restaurant is excellent. Good balanced menu between international and Indonesian. Prepared excellently by team of chefs. Breakfast has a superb selection too. Decent wines to accompany.
All a bit pricey by local standards but brilliant value contrasted to many other places across the world.

There aren't many holiday destinations I'd intend returning to - the world is as big place. This is one of the very best and one that I will return to!

Go there - you couldn't regret it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1371,Worth EVERY penny. Can't fault it.,50,June 2014,"We have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and this has to be one of the best. The surroundings are gorgeous, our room was huge and absolutely lovely, the staff all remember you name and nothing is too much trouble, the food and cocktails are wonderful and reasonable priced, and all day they bring you little treats, snacks and surprises all free. It is located walking distance from shops, cafe's and restaurants but aside from a walk into town, we didn't feel the need to leave the resort.
One day we accidentally left our safe unlocked. It had all our valuables in it including a substantial amount of cash in local and US dollars. The staff simply closed the safe and locked it for us - nothing was missing. We were so grateful and impressed since we have had stuff stolen from hotel rooms by cleaning staff a few times before (not in Bali).
I cannot fault anything about this hotel. Absolutely loved it. It is worth every extra penny that you pay for it. We will definitely be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1372,The most expensive hotel I have ever stayed at BUT...,50,October 2013,"...it was sooo worth it!!! Since we've been married, my husband and i have travelled to a fair few places and we both agree that, as of today, this is the best hotel we have stayed at by far!

We were given a welcome drink on arrival and taken to sit down for check in. While filling in the paperwork we were greeted by perhaps the guest relations manager or the deputy/acting manager - unfortunately i cant remember his role but he came and greeted us by name and congratulated us on our anniversary, which we thought was a nice touch.

We had booked a studio suite but were upgraded to a one bedroom suite, and it was huge!!! The room opened out to a large dining/living area with a toilet on one side, and a small pantry on the other. There were complimentary nuts, cookies, and crisps/cassava chips provided each day, and the soft drinks in the mini bar were free. Free bottles of water were provided and replenished every day in the rooms. There was a fruit basket provided in the room as well as a complimentary bottle of champagne and a cake for our anniversary, it was yummy too.

The room had a separate bedroom with a large bed and his and hers wardrobes, and the bathroom was huge with double sinks, a bath, separate shower stall and separate toilet. All bathroom accessories provided including toothbrushes and toothpaste. Slippers, robes etc.

Both the bedroom and living room had floor to ceiling windows and outside there was a daybed and a table and chairs on the balcony. We had a seaview but there was a big palm tree blocking most of it. We didnt really mind though as we could easily go down and just look at the sea from the pool, cafe, or beach!

The pool was lovely (and it really is just one big pool on three levels, even though it is advertised as three pools), we spent almost every day by the pool just relaxing! Free water was always brought round and sometimes we got little treats like sorbet!

The breakfast was plentiful and there was a wide selection of items to eat. You could order a number of things cooked to order.

The hotel served complimentary afternoon tea every evening, and we enjoyed this every day, just watching the sunset from the bar – it was beautiful. A couple of minor negatives here – they do not offer a complimentary soft drink as an alternative to the tea of coffee, like orange juice. This was a shame as I do not really drink tea or coffee much so if we wanted a soft drink we had to pay extra. I think this was more noticeable to us because we had come from a hotel in Ubud (Komaneka Rasa Sayang) that also offered complimentary afternoon tea and they did give juices as complimentary, too.
The other thing, also regarding the afternoon tea was that it was served between certain times, and we arrived at check in, about 10 mins after the tea was over. We asked if we could still have the afternoon tea but were told, no, it was over for the day. Again, I think this was only comparable as we had the same situation in Ubud when we arrived there at check in about 30 mins after tea had finished and they still allowed us to have the afternoon tea as a gesture of goodwill.

Enough about the hotel now. The main thing that makes this place special is the service. It was outstanding! We did not meet a single member of staff who was rude or even slightly unfriendly. The staff at the hotel go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and special, and they really make you feel as though their main aim is to make you have the holiday of your life. Everywhere we went we were greeted by name, from the first day we got there. At breakfast, by the pool, on the telephone! There are so many little things that the staff did that we appreciated that I probably won't be able to mention them all but to give an example of a few things we appreciated and will always remember the kindness they showed:

1) The waves on Seminyak beach are LOUD. So loud that I couldn't sleep – it was 1am the first night and we called up reception to ask if they had any earplugs. They didn't but they could go out and get them for us. They went out at 1am and brought me earplugs! I have no idea which stores were still open then!
2) I was a little unwell during the stay with back pain and so we asked if they had a hot water bottle or pack we could borrow. They didn't really understand what we were asking for, and initially they brought us hot water, then there were a few more phone calls and it was established that no, they didn't have one. Fair enough – you don't expect it to be something hotels would generally keep. However, a few hours later, someone came up to our room bearing a hot water bottle. Turns out they had gone out and bought one for us! They really did not have to do this, but they went out of their way to make me more comfortable and I really appreciated that.
3) At breakfast, we were greeted by name every day and the staff were always smiling and helpful. My husband asked if they could make him vegetarian nasi goreng on the first and second day (which they kindly did for him) and on all days after that, he didn't even have to ask, the staff remembered exactly what he wanted!
4) One afternoon we ordered a vegetarian sandwich for room service – unfortunately the one we got was not vegetarian. Luckily we realised before trying it and called up to let the kitchen know. Understandably the staff were very apologetic and removed the cost of the sandwich from the bill, providing us with a vegetarian one. This was all done in a very quick and humble manner. They also offered us a complimentary dessert as an apology, which I thought was a nice touch. It was enough for us that they removed the sandwich from the bill, they didn't really need to offer us something else. But they did and we thought that was very nice.
5) The set up of the room was such that the living room and bedroom were separate rooms. The TV was in the living room, and when we arrived, we expressed concern about this as we usually like to watch movies in bed while on holiday, as we just wanted to lounge around and relax! The staff said they would move the tv for us so that it was in the bedroom. However, they did not do this. Instead they brought us an EXTRA tv (same size!) and an EXTRA dvd player!!! This was really above and beyond what was expected of the hotel.
6) When we checked out, we were waiting around in the lobby for our taxi for 5-10 mins. It came and we got in, but just before we left, the same gentleman who greeted us on arrival came running out to wish us well and personally thank us for staying at the hotel. I did not see him in the lobby while we were waiting for our taxi, so it just goes to show how they must pay such attention to detail to make a point of knowing when we were leaving to come and personally say goodbye.

I could go on and on with many other small things but this review is already too long! Yes, the hotel is expensive but, really, it is in a class of it's own. The staff make it what it is – they really, really make you feel like royalty and do everything they can to make sure you have the best time. No request, big or small, is too much for them. I would personally like to express our gratitude to all the staff at the hotel that made our stay so wonderful, from the management, to the chefs who catered to our special requests, to the smiling and ever helpful reception staff, the housekeeping, to the pool and bar staff, right to the security guards outside the hotel who always greeted us and made us feel safe as they kept an eye on those entering and leaving the hotel. I could go on and on. I'm afraid this review is rather late and I don't remember names, but even if I did, the list would be endless as every single member of staff we encountered was so friendly, professional, and willing to help. The staff really are the biggest credit to this hotel.

My only regret: I collect magnets from every place we go to but unfortunately I was unable to get a magnet from Bali, which I was very sad about. I was hoping to get it from Seminyak but Seminyak is not the type of place that really sells tourist souvenirs, and unfortunately we did not travel anywhere further as we could not bear to tear ourselves away from our wonderful hotel for anything more than an hour or two at dinner. It was simply that amazing.

There are so many places in the world, and we would like to see as many as possible – we make it a point to go to a different country every time we go away so unfortunately it is not likely that we will go back to Bali for a long time. If and when we do go back, however, I know for a fact that we will not even consider staying anywhere other than here.

I have brought back so many wonderful memories from Bali, but alas, I left my heart behind at the Legian…",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1373,Pretty much flawless,50,June 2014,"For me it had everything I look for in a beach resort hotel:
- Quality spacious rooms
- Great food and drink options
- Wonderful pool and sunbathing area with direct beach access
- Close to the sea from the pool areas so you can feel close to the ocean
- Warm helpful staff
- Quality gym / exercise facilities

Was also reasonable value for money with complementary mini bar in the room.

Overall it was a very relaxing place to be, and I will certainly return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1374,Perfect!,50,June 2014,"We stayed here for a week after hopping around Dubai, Singapore and spending two nights in Ubud. Simply the best place I have ever stayed. Facilities and service were unrivalled and nothing was too much trouble. The quality of the food was brilliant and we could've easily stayed forever. Amazing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1375,Sensational stay,50,June 2014,"We stayed at The Legian for 7 nights at the end of our honeymoon which included a stop in Singapore and four nights in Ubud. We had kept a close watch on the reviews of this hotel in the build up to our trip and became very excited about our stay. We didn't think all the reviewers could be wrong and we certainly weren't disappointed. Quite simply this hotel exceeded all our expectations from the room to the food and particularly the very personal service delivered by the team.

We were greeted with a wonderfully genuine and warm reception by Eka and this was followed by a personal welcome from the general manager. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite with ocean view. It was stunning. The pictures in the brochure did not quite do justice to the size of the suite. It was huge. As well as the living, dining and bedroom areas there was a separate toilet and the minibar had its own room with a sink, espresso machine and a selection of complimentary snacks. The bathroom was equally big with two sinks, bath and separate rain shower. There was a daily turn down service. As well as a honeymoon cake we were generously greeted by a bottle of champagne on ice and a personalised card congratulating us on our nuptials. This attention to personal detail was a theme throughout our stay.

The pool area is very nice and leads directly onto the beach. There was never any issue with getting a sunbed or day bed. The poolside service was excellent with a constant supply of water, occasional snacks and a lovely complimentary afternoon tea. There are boogie boards to use which were great fun.

We were welcomed by the food and beverage manager who knew our names before we even introduced ourselves. He took genuine interest in how we were enjoying our stay, recommended a local breakfast dish that was not infer menu and even provided us with the recipe! Breakfast was top notch with a huge selection but the eggs benedict was unbeatable. We ate in the restaurant one evening and took room service on another. The food was very good and considering the quality of the hotel very reasonably priced.

As keen spa goers we took 2 days worth of treatments. They were the best treatments we have ever had accompanied by the sound of the waves of the Indian Ocean crashing against the shore. As we both booked 2 days worth of treatments we were given a good deal by the manager. There is a well equipped gym with the most modern equipment (who knew you could use Facebook whilst on a treadmill?).

Overall we had the most wonderful time at The Legian. As well as being a beautiful place to stay the staff are amazing. We were accommodated with a late check out the day we left and waved off by the general manager (we are sure this was just excellent hospitality rather than relief that we were actually leaving!). You are guaranteed a great stay at this hotel. We are already planning a return trip and that is not something we have ever said about a hotel before.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1376,Grand Dame of Bali hotels,50,June 2014,"The Legian is the grand dame of Bali hotels and knocks the socks off her competition with the fantastic service from the long standing staff and the elegant and spacious rooms.

We stayed at the Legian for 6 nights with two young children in tow and had a wonderful time. This was our first stay at the Legian despite having visited Bali many times over the years. We loved the convenient location in the middle of Seminyak, the dedicated staff and the beautiful view of the ocean from the gardens and the pool. Although we had some hiccups during our stay such as the smell of fried fish in the second bedroom coming through the windows and the air-conditioning, this was promptly fixed by the staff and we were able to put the children to bed in the room later that evening.

The offer of the hospitality suite to freshen up before a flight was also a lovely touch which we have not enjoyed at any other hotel we have stayed in anywhere else in the world.

We hope to be back again soon! Our thanks to everyone at the Legian for a very enjoyable stay!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1377,Perfection - we'll be back!,50,June 2014,"I have always wanted to stay here so we extended our recent trip to Bali so I could have a few days at The Legian Bali. It was better than I expected and I had high expectations!
We booked a villa at The Club. This is just across the road from the main resort but meant we had our own villa and pool. It was superb - I really don't have enough positive words. The villa was roomy but not too large, with a four poster bed and a large stone bath out in the garden - best bath I have seen. The pool is actually pretty large and the bale was big with a proper dinning table. There were also two shady bale's along the side of the villa so at anytime of the day, it was easy to get out of the sun. Everything in the minibar is included in the price and was replenished as we used it by our butler.
The great thing about these villa's is that they are part of a club so you have use of a large pool at the clubhouse that is only open to the 11 villa residents. The clubhouse also had breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes and cocktails (all included in the villa price). You could also get meals and drinks from here anytime. The staff were amazing, a high level of attention but none of it obtrusive.
On the final day of our stay in Bali we moved to a suite in the main hotel as we had a late flight and just needed it to relax and shower in. The suite was a good size with a huge balcony looking out over the grass to the beach. The balcony had a day bed and eating table. We would have been just as comfortable in the suite as the villa.
The resort grounds are beautiful, peaceful and quiet with one of the best pool complexes I've seen. We spent a fantastic day lying around the main pool, had lunch on our day bed and stayed through to watching the sun set with a cocktail - an awesome day.
We ate in the restaurant each night we were there, because it was so good - and great value for money for a five star experience.
I really love this hotel and we will definitely be going back next time we go to Bali. Every staff member we met was friendly and really proficient, the facilities are top notch and in great condition, it's incredibly clean and well maintained and you get the feeling that the team running this hotel love what they do. But its all the little thoughtful things that really set it apart - the wine and canapes for our arrival, being met by the team at the door to our villa where we checked in, the treats in our room each day, the refreshing face cloths and iced water served all day by the pool. Made for a very relaxing treat.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1378,Amazing as always,50,June 2014,"We have stayed at this hotel many times since it's opening in 1996 and as always the service , staff and hotel are amazing the rooms very big the gardens and pools excellent we were greeted by the GM Kevin and nothing was to much trouble . We stayed in a ground floor room straight out on to gardens and pools , Staff always remember our names ,We will be back many times to come , lWish we could have stayed longer , The pancakes at breakfast are awesome try them , thanks Bonnie and John",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1379,Excellent and clean,50,June 2014,"We loved coming back and the way we were greeted , staff were amazing I know we were only there 24 hours but loved every minute.
The pool area is stunning and very well catered for. I had a foot massage by the pool",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1380,Our first trip / HONEYMOON to Heavenly Bali!,40,May 2014,"We stayed at The Legian during our first 3 nights in Bali and we were really satisfied by the excellent service. We were greeted by the GM and even the hotel staff remember our name! The room was exceptionally big and gorgeous. The hotel staff even put some food and a greeting card to welcome our honeymoon trip. The breakfast was good and what's better than eating your egg and bacon with a million dollar sea view?!
One thing that we are not really satisfied is the bed sheet. The bed sheet had the damp wet feeling, compared to their sister hotel company, Chedi Club Tanah Gajah. Other than that, everything was good at the Legian.
Security is excellent. During one of the night, unknowingly our entrance room door was widely open due to the strong wind; only to realise it the next morning. My wife panicked as she put some of her precious stuff at the living room. However, all of our stuff were still in place!! Good job Legian for maintaining such an excellent service and security. Please do not change and we look forward to staying there again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1381,Mind blowing experience,50,June 2014,"I've stayed in some pretty smart hotels over the years and I tend not to get too wowed by hotels these days. However,The Legian is a breathtaking experience from the minute you arrive. The service is astonishing and the rooms (we stayed in the deluxe suite) are well appointed and serviced by some excellent room service. The swimming pools, bars, restaurants are all what you would expect from this level of hotel. The big distinguishing point is always the service and the quality of staff they have at the hotel.

The hotel has breathtaking views and Seminyak is a lovely town with some nice places to drink and eat too. I cannot thank you enough for making our honeymoon so pleasurable.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1382,You will not be disappointed,50,May 2014,"I have read some of the reviews of this hotel and I came to the conclusion that I really could not add to the praise they have already elicited from other guests. But I cannot resist the opportunity to at least acknowledge that the management and staff created for me and my wife a memorable experience that we shall never forget.
The staff work very hard and this is the core of the experience because they do this with good grace and pleasantness from beginning to end. A typical day starts with a pleasant greeting at breakfast from the smiles of the attendants and goes on through to the pool areas and restaurants. The staff who clean the rooms and leave them pristine should not be forgotten either.
In truth I had expected as much and I thought that the holiday would be partly made by this level of attention to making our stay trouble free. I had also thought that I would be keen to get out and about to see what the island of Bali had to offer but I was seduced by the hotel and I was glad to surrender!
I wish we lived nearer...
So in rounding off, thank you so much.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1383,Exceptional Experience,50,June 2014,"Our family of 5 stayed in the 2-room suite for 3 nights. The moment we stepped into the hotel, saw the pools and spoke to the staff, we felt truly on holiday. We loved every moment spent in the Legian and will be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1384,Honeymoon Luxury,50,June 2014,"The Legian is the epitome of luxury. My husband and I spent just 2 nights at the Legian on our honeymoon. It was exactly what we needed. The suite we stayed in was absolutely perfect with a large sitting room overlooking the ocean and two patios for lounging and eating. We were welcomed with a bottle of champagne to enjoy while we unpacked. Everything throughout our stay was just right. The gorgeous pool and beach area were perfect: from the water and cold towel at the loungers to the perfect spot to watch sunset. The infinity pool was warm but refreshing. The breakfast buffet was wonderful with a great selection of Western and Indonesian cuisine.

Only minor negative: We ate dinner at the restaurant on our first night there. The service and atmosphere were wonderful, but for the prices we paid the food was a little underwhelming. We enjoyed the tenderloin appetizer with Balinese spices a lot, but the main courses did not spark too much excitement. The next night we went to Bambu, just a short walk away, which was great. A true taste of ""upscale Indonesian"".

Overall, a wonderful resort! We wish we could have stayed longer!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1385,Excellent except ......,40,June 2014,"This hotel is excellent!! From the time we checked in to the time we checked out - simply excellent.
Check in- prompt and smooth. We were greeted by the Asst Manager (Rohan) who was very warm. Reception gave us a short tour of the property and by the time we got to our rooms (10mins tops) our luggage was already in our room.
Service - faultless even if one is fault finding. Prompt service with a smile. They even address everyone in your party by name. Even the people cleaning the fish ponds were smiling and greeting you when you walk pass them.
Rooms - heaven. Huge 1 bedroom suite complete with a small pantry, huge balcony with your own private day bed overlooking the magnificent Indian Ocean, comfy king bed, surprisingly comfy rollaway bed, huge bathroom with a huge bath-tub. Get the picture.
Food - 5 star standard except that they can't quite get poached eggs right. (Gordon Ramsey would throw a fit if served such poached eggs). Other than that, food was of a high standard and quality. I personally loved the chicken curry they served.
Pool - 3 tiered pool that overlooks the beach. You can soak yourself in the pool and listen to the waves all day. Simply heaven.
Spa - sets itself a very high standard. Liked it so much that my family and I went back again before we left.
Check out - seamless. Bill explained thoroughly even though I did not ask for it to be explained. And Rohan (Asst Manager) was on hand to see us off.
At the airport - staff from the hotel helped us all the way to the point where we paid for the airport tax and went through to immigration.
That's service for you.
So why did I give it a 4 star rating and an excellent review?
The only down side was that somehow, the General Manager manages to stop and chat with EVERYONE AROUND US but somehow manages not to see us and drop in for even a quick hello. Perhaps he thought we couldn't speak English but even then, it's not an excuse to drop in and say a quick hello. We are ALL PAYING GUEST no matter what. So that was the only thing that marred what was otherwise a perfect place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1386,The ideal destination,50,May 2014,"We had stayed 3wks August 09 and we're not disappointed May 20-30 2014 for our return ""home"" to beautiful location and great weather. The suites continue to delight with amazing vistas to the ocean. I was so happy to see that the night lights shinning on the surf are still there! The addition of the third pool only added to the perfection of the peaceful, immaculate and calm surroundings. Kevin Ambramowicz, Manager and Verina Rendiza, Head Concierge ensured our stay was everything we were looking forward to. In fact the customer service of each and every member of staff serves as an example to all five Starr properties!
It's hard to single out the exceptional experiences....from the guys manning the day beds on the beach with water, fresh towelettes, facial spray....ice cream/fruit nibbles...to the lifeguard who rescued someone not respecting the power of the waves....too the restaurant folks who ensured not only my special birthday will be remembered with fondness, but each and every meal we shared....to housekeeping that tidied and prepped the room each day.....to the spa professionals and their heavenly treatments....gift shop ..... Cocktail wishing us bon voyage to the extra effort by Verina who surprised me with a gift....Thank you for 10 days that felt like 30 and we hope to be back but much sooner next times. GHM have a fantastic formula and we will continue to explore countries where we can be guaranteed a true five star experience at their properties",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1387,Wow wow wow,50,June 2014,"Echoing all the other 5 star reviews of this hotel.....The Legian is simply fabulous! A beautiful hotel in a great location; The Legian is set on a prime strip of beach in Seminyak that is far enough away from the hustle and bustle that you can feel away from it all, whilst being close enough that you can dip in and out of town at your leisure with ease (though every time you leave the hotel you just want to get back as quickly as possible as you can't bear to be away too long!!)
But what really makes The Legian stand out is the service. ALL of the staff go out of their way to accomodate you and make you feel welcome - but in a way that is not formal or stuffy but rather comes across as genuine and heartfelt - these guys really want you to enjoy your holiday, and boy do they do a great job of it!!
We were upgraded from a Studio Suite to a One-Bed Villa Suite which was a serious bonus! The room was huge; the decor perhaps a little 'corporate' for our taste but nonetheless supemely comfortable and luxiourious (love the Acqua Di Parma products in the bathroom). The restaurant is a great; reasonably priced for such a luxury hotel and a spectacular setting with excellent dishes. Breakfast definitely a highlight. Also lots of little touches that make a difference, like a constant chilled drinking water by the pool delivered to your sunbed, free tea for all guests between 4-6pm, wet towels and face mist by the pool to wipe the sweat from your brow etc etc.
The spa is also fantastic - great treatments and beautiful setting.
From the moment you check in, you literally don't need to think for yourself, everything is taken of care and for me that is exactly what I want when I travel.
If you're still reading this review then just stop and book now. Don't bother looking at other hotels in Seminyak as they won't come close to The Legian. You may pay a premium for The Legian but it's worth every rupiah!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1388,The Best,50,May 2014,"I have just returned from my trip to Bali, and The Legian. This has to be the best hotel in Seminyak. l will definitely be recommending to anyone and everyone. The location, rooms, hotel facilities and service are all outstanding! . The hotel is Beach front and also walking distance to best shopping, restaurants and nightlife in Seminyak.
This is one of the best hotels l have stayed at, I will be 100% returning to this property.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1389,Incredible stay at the Legian,50,May 2014,"We have just returned from our honeymoon - 4 nights of which we spent at the Legian. I can only agree with all the other reviewers when They say how amazing it is.
From the beginning of our stay right to the end everything was perfect. We had a slick pick up at the airport, and though we checked in quite late we had a bottle of champagne and honeymoon cake waiting. We stayed in a one bedroom suite - thoroughly recommend staying in an ocean view if you can. The rooms are huge, and ours had a huge balcony with large sofa and table and chairs.
Our room was maintained impeccably - turndown service, replenished with whatever we needed whenever we needed it.
When we got to breakfast in the morning everyone greeted us by name. Breakfast is incredible - overlooking the ocean with the sound of the waves to accompany the incredible food!
Staff at the hotel are great - remember your name, friendly but in no way intrusive. They recommended some lovely places to eat and helped organise a day trip for us.
We have been to Seminyak before, and this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in. If you are planning a trip to Bali I would thoroughly recommend staying here - amazing!
If you",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1390,Incredible - no other word to describe it!,50,May 2014,"My husband and I have just returned from our honeymoon to Hong Kong and Bali and during our trip we decided to stay for 8 days at The Legian. We have never written a review before but felt the need to put pen to paper as it was such an amazing decision staying here! Before we arrived, we had read the wonderful reviews on tripadvisor and had actually by chance met several people who had also stayed here and couldn't fault the hotel so we were really excited before our holiday had even started!

The hotel itself is simply beautiful with immaculate grounds and infinity pool area. We stayed in a huge one bedroom deluxe suite on the third floor which had clearly been designed with sumptuous taste and and it boasted magnificent sea views. When we arrived a gorgeous honeymoon cake and bottle of champagne was waiting for us!

The second main point we feel the need to make is the staff- they are so caring and considerate and can't do enough for you to the point at times when we felt slightly embarrassed that they wouldn't even let us move our deck chair ourselves but this isn't done in a pretentious way. We told them it was fine we could do it and their response was simply ''relax you are on holiday''.They genuinely go out of their way to ensure that you have an experience of a lifetime.

The concierge and reception staff were very helpful and were able to advise on some wonderful restaurants and day trips (we did Elephant Safari - definitely a must). The two managers are a credit to the hotel and were always walking around speaking to us and other guests to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction. Nothing was ever too much trouble and there is clearly great communication between all teams at the hotel.
The staff all address you by name, know your order at breakfast, your favourite drink and where you prefer to sunbathe!

The breakfast at the hotel is very tasty and we found that there was a wide variety of cereals, yogurt, fruit and breads etc and hot dishes on the menu to choose from (everything hot is cooked fresh for each person). The lunches were divine and we were also offered complimentary afternoon tea each afternoon at 4pm. We never got round to dining at the hotel restaurant but the menu looked delicious and other guests have commented on the high standard of the food there. The hotel is so well located that you are literally a 5 minute walk away from a bustling road filled with restaurants and bars and lovely clothing and swimwear shops.

We also made use of the gym which had all exercise equipment one would require and every morning it offers a free yoga class for all guests. As part of our honeymoon package we received a 1 hour complimentary Balinese massage in the spa which was fantastic!

If you go to Bali DO NOT stay anywhere else - we can't wait to return!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1391,Third visit but first in the main hotel - totally faultless - easily one of my top 5 hotels worldwide.,50,June 2014,"I have stayed at the Legian Club Villas twice before but as I was traveling alone this time, I opted for the main hotel. I had expected less than the club but no, the attention to detail, the staff attitude, the rooms, the food, the management response was honestly 100% throughout. I'm picky and probably not an easy guest but The Legian is warm, welcoming, accommodating and I think easily the best in Bali by a very long way!

The rooms are huge, traditional but in perfect order, and always immaculately cleaned. Good facilities, Bose sound etc, a couple of great infinity pools facing the ocean right on the beach, a great bar and a very very good restaurant, all with amazing service throughout - what more do I need?

This remains my only choice for Bali and I've looked at the W and a couple of others but this feels like home each time. The hotel is in the best part of Seminyak, near all the good shops and restaurants. I'm sorry if this all sounds like an advert, but I rarely get this enthusiastic about somewhere!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1392,What an incredible hotel!,50,May 2014,"The Legian is incredible! I have never stayed at a hotel which is so unbelievably slick. The three tiered swimming pool is gorgeous and there were rarely more than two people in each tier at a time. The staff are phenomenal; constantly smiling and nothing is too much for them. If you leave your sun lounger they straighten your towels, your glass of ice water is constantly topped up and you are even given a mist spray to keep you cool. The beach is great for surfing (the hotel have boards you can borrow) but the current is quite strong and not a turquoise water white sand place. Tea is served whilst you are lying on your sun lounger! A three tiered cake stand is delivered with incredibly delicious treats. We were upgraded to a suite over looking the sea which was lovely. Other reviews have mentioned the rooms being dark. This isn't something we would have noticed/ mentioned but it's true they aren't bright and sunny but definitely not dark and dingey. The position was great, with lots of amazing restaurants within walking distance and amazing shopping. Really hope we can come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1393,"Tranquility Personified ""The Club At The Legian""",50,May 2014,"We are coming to the end of what can only be described as a wonderful holiday under the guidance of probably one of the leading hotel managers in the world Kevin Abramowicz. Together with his superb management and staff they have provided us with a memorable experience.

During the week it was my wife's birthday and after breakfast we heard all the staff entering the villa singing Happy Birthday. Much to her embarrassment they provided her with a gorgeous bouquet of flowers, champagne and a birthday cake. Something we will always remember.

We are now sat alongside the pool in our garden villa in the most tranquil setting one could imagine. With the sound of Balinese music drifting across the gardens from the beach.

The key to this wonderful holiday as been the service our butler Eka has provided us with. He is so knowledgable, experienced and informative on all aspects of Balinese life. We prefer privacy at certain times of the day and with his expert eye for detail and personal service this has been made possible throughout our stay.

Like many trippers have commented everything as been said about the hotel, so we would only be repeating what others have said. However it is very clear to see why it's the No 1 in Seminyak.

Once again an enormous thank you to everyone at the Club and Hotel who made this holiday so very special.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1394,"""Faultless in every way""",50,May 2014,"If you are looking to stay in Seminyak the one and only hotel to consider is The Legian. It was truly faultless from begining to the end in every possible way. We stayed for 2 weeks and the service never lessened infact I would probably say improved as the staff got to know you better. From Senior Management namely Rohann Chandra couldn't have been more accomodating and always went the extra mile to the more Junior Staff, everyday producing a genuine smile and the need to want to please. A truly memorable experience that I have already recommended to others on my return to the UK.
Our reson to return to Bali would have to be to experience The Legian all over again but cannot give a reason how they could possibly improve on what they already have a perfect combination to be left alone when required to the continous attentiveness when needed... makes the perfect and idyllic hotel experience.

Thank you so much to both Rohann and Kevin from Mr & Mrs Pond",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1395,My birthday remembered - a year later,50,May 2014,"Whilst this review is actually not focused on the original visit, I am reminded of a wonderful trip with world class hospitality and service as always enjoyed at The Legian. Today I received a birthday card at home a year to the day of my visit. Thank you! Please also note that everyone should go and try the steak with a lobe of foie gras!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1396,Deserves its reputation,50,May 2014,"I can't add much to what's already been said, other than it's really pricey. But the service is amazing, second to none. Almost pre-emptive. Overall, a very well-run, beautiful hotel, with really good room service and plenty on offer for vegetarians.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1397,"""Heavenly, Peaceful and Excellent Service""",50,May 2014,"A lot has been written regarding The Legian in terms of the service level that it provides, the ambience it creates, the lovely comfortable and luxurious rooms. Well its all true.

Arriving from the hustle and bustle of the airport it was a joy entering the hotel foyer, where several people greet you and quickly go through the check in process.

Our room was a studio suite, which had everything you would wish for and more. Beautifully appointed with an ocean front view. They also have villas, which are located across the road and away from the beach.

We were there for 10days and during that period met some amazing staff members who were extremely well trained and provided a high-class service with a smile. Nothing was too much trouble and special mention goes to Edi who was gracious and helpful.

The hotel ambience is all inspiring particularly as its ocean facing and it looks amazing in the evening with fires lit up around the pool area and lanterns everywhere.

Seminyak region is a busy place with lots of traffic during the daytime and need to be careful, as the roads are narrow and little in the way of footpaths. The area is safe and served by many good restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel.

Enjoy",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1398,Absolute unadulterated luxury!,50,May 2014,"This hotel being one of ""The leading hotels of the world"" deserves this accolade and works hard at maintaining this title....Right down from Kevin the GM to Henry, one of the many pool attendants, their attention to detail and ""nothing is too much trouble"" attitude is exemplary. As per previous reviews rooms, even basic studios, are amazing....breakfasts outstanding and the restaurant meals wonderful I could go on but it's already been said....but it's the little things which make the difference as in ringing down for ice and being asked ""Certainly, would you like sliced lime with that"" and it being delivered within minutes....We usually like to try different hotels even in the same resort but have to say that ""The Legian"" has captured our hearts and when we return to Seminyak it will most certainly be to ""The Legian"" which is so deserving of it's many praises. It is also very well placed for exploring the many restaurants, shops and bars which are all excellent.....",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1399,Perfection still!,50,May 2014,"We have just arrived home from our 5th stay at The Legian, and once again our stay there was absolutely perfect. I'm pretty fussy when it comes to hotels, but seriously am unable to fault this property in any way. The rooms are pure luxury, completely soundproofed, all with wonderful ocean views, all the staff are magnificent, the location is wonderful - it truly is amazing.
It is so amazing we booked our next getaway there in October before we even left, and are now just counting down the weeks until we return!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1400,True Excellence,50,May 2014,"Having just returned from a 12 night stay at The Legian- we can't wait to go back! Everything here is fantastic and we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Seminyak. The property is beautiful with an amazing pool area overlooking the ocean with a choice of loungers or daybeds and two pool bars servicing each side of the pools. The room are beautiful- we stayed in a one bedroom suite. My only negative is that the rooms are so dark! The bathroom is the only room with a mirror and it is so dark and almost impossible to do make up/ hair etc. I understand about mood lighting, but there should be a dimmer option to have it lighter when needed.

We spent the first few nights in a 2nd floor room (there are 3 floors in total) but our view was completely obstructed by trees, which also made the room a lot darker. We were eventually moved to a 3rd floor room and felt like we had been upgraded! This was so much brighter and sunnier and we had a beautiful ocean view now to enjoy the sunsets.

We ate dinner twice in the restaurant, which was excellent both times. The food is of a very high standard. Breakfast is fantastic, whilst overlooking the pool and ocean- the food options are great and are of an excellent standard. The brioche french toast is heaven! The staff remembered your coffee/ tea preferences.

I visited the spa, which was OK. The massage was OK, not excellent and the facilities weren't as luxurious as other spas but the price was very reasonable for a resort so I can't really complain! Still worth a visit.

What really makes this hotel are the staff. As others have said, everyone from housekeeping, to drivers, to concierge, to the pool staff are just excellent. Everyone greets you when they see you, remember your name and your likes/dislikes. The pool staff would anticipate your needs without being intrusive. They really did make our holiday so pleasurable. I can't say enough about how wonderful they were.

Everything here is fabulous- rooms, staff, food, location, pool- do not hesitate to book here- you will love it!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1401,Just as good second visit,50,May 2014,"I stayed here last year with a friend for a girls trip and loved it so much, came back this trip with my partner and I loved it just as much. The best location on the beach, great for shopping and restuarants are all close by. The hotel itself, rooms and pool area are all flawless -plus little extra touches that makes it feels like home away from home. Staff are well trained and are amazing at remembering you, your name, your likes and dislikes, without being over-bearing. If you are looking for a true 5 star experience - look no further. Highly recommend the morning yoga classes too! We stayed at other 5 star properties (supposedly) that did not come close to what you can expect from the team at The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1402,Heaven!!!,50,May 2014,"We have been staying at The Legian ever since 2004 when visiting Bali. There is no other hotel in Bali to offer everything one could expect: the location is perfect for long walks on the beach and surfing, great shopping nearby, various restaurants walking distance to choose from; the design of the hotel and the grounds - it has been said in the previous reviews time and again - simply breath taking!!!; the most polite, friendly and helpful staff who would go the extra mile to make sure the guests are well looked after! One needs to see it to believe it! It is heaven!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1403,Fabulous Hotel,50,May 2014,"We stayed at the Legian for 5 nights in a 1 bedroom suite on the ground floor overlooking the lawn.
Exceptional hotel and one of the best we have stayed at and we have been fortunate enough to stay in some marvellous hotels over the years.
The service was outstanding from being picked up at the airport, through to check in and being shown around the room with every detail being explained. The suite was large and extremely well appointed with so many things thought about to make our stay so enjoyable. We enjoyed the taster meal in the restaurant one night and this was very good with the exception of one course which all 4 of us thought was disappointing. We also enjoyed the sea food BBQ evening which was absolutely wonderful!
The service was outstanding by all members of staff, mostly using your name which is a great touch. Breakfast was excellent with great service once again.
Afternoon tea is a wonderful bonus and really nice idea. Water provided continuously when sunbathing together with spray mist and cold towels all added to the feeling of luxury and were very welcoming in the heat.
The grounds are very well maintained and the whole feel of the hotel is that of shear luxury. I wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel if ever staying in Bali again.
If I was to give any negative feedback it would be for the terrace of the room to be better lit and have a fan. There was a lot of shrubbery around the terrace which it made it too dark to use and also too hot without an outside fan. Also I found the inside of the suite to be a little too dark for my liking and could have been better lit. Again this was possibly due to being on the ground floor with so many plants close by.
What became very evident during our stay was the dedication of the staff and their attention to detail. They all appear to take great pride in their work and will go to great lengths to make sure all guests enjoy a memorable stay at the Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1404,Would never even debate another hotel in the area....,50,May 2014,"This place was perfect. I can't say there was one problem with our stay. Check in was efficient; actually better than efficient. We had stayed the 3 nights prior at their partner hotel, the Chedi Club in Ubud, and they had transfered virtually all our passport and payment information. Made the process take only moments. We had a standard studio suite and I can say that, for a couple, this was far more than we even needed. Had all the amenities one could need.

Service at the pool & at the restaurants was amazing. Concierge was a great help and we frequently would use the pool staff as a liason between ourselves and the concierege which was great (since we were usually laying by the pool when we decided where we wanted to get dinner reservations at). We didn't do a full sit down dinner in the restaurant, but all the snacks pool side were great, so I can only assume its the same in the restaurant. Pools are perfect and even kid friendly.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1405,Blew me away!,50,May 2014,"This truly is a world class hotel with an outstanding position, gorgeous romantic aspect onto the beach, magnificent pools and grounds, beautiful rooms with great views. The food and beverage was good, but best of all were the smiling, helpful and genuinely caring team of people! Starting with Kevin (GM) who is a wonderful host, working through the concierge desk, the front desk staff, the drivers, the staff in room service and around the pool, and everyone knew us by name! This is a country that truly understands the meaning of service and this hotel exemplifies this to the maximum.

Nothing was too much trouble. My dietary needs around healthy options, gluten-free, no chilli all catered to with a smile. They even made special dishes up for me as modifications on the divine seafood buffet.

The massage treatment was also quite heavenly - try the four hands massage!
I do think a good steam room and jacuzzi would enhance the hotel further but the pools were so good for doing laps or just lazing around. The complimentary afternoon tea served to you on gorgeous daybeds or sun lounges was just too civilised for words!

And I even got to splash around in the ocean a few steps from my day bed.

I have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world. This is in my top 5.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1406,This is one of the best hotels in the world!,50,May 2014,"My friend and I stayed at The Legian (for me it was my fourth stay and for my friend it was the second stay!). We enjoyed everything so very much! On our flight back to australia we couldn't quite work out which are the best aspects because everything was perfect. I would like to start on the property and facilities - the rooms are gorgeous! The pool is magnificant! The gynasium has been upgraded and is fantastic! The food and beverage is exceptional but the best part of all is the people! Starting with Kevin (Hotel Manager) who is a wonderful host, working through the concierge desk, the front desk staff, the staff in room service, the cleaning staff in the room, and the wonderful, helpful and courteous pool men (Cendana, Edi, Buri, etc.) - everyone knew us by name! I have travelled extensively throughout Asia and the only other hotel that comes close to The Legian is the Metropole in Hanoi. We will stay again and again at The Legian. Thank you to everyone for a lovely five days!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1407,The Best!!!,50,April 2014,"Our three night stay at the Legian at the end of April, 2014 was the BEST hotel stay we have ever had. Period!! We did not want to leave to go to Ubud and would have stayed at the Legian if we could have. This hotel has done everything right!! The hotel itself is stunning, the location is perfect, the food is impeccable, and the entire staff, including the management is incredibly attentive. You can see how beautiful the hotel is from all of the pictures on the web but what you don't see, and what I feel TripAdvisor reviews are so important, is the description of the ambiance, attitude and service you experience.
All of the small details, from the cold towels and water while relaxing on the beach, to the beautifully written welcome note, to the management taking the time to come to you to get to know you, are all well thought out and perfectly executed. It is not possible for the service to be any better.
From the moment we arrived and were welcomed by the Assistant GM, to the moment we left when the GM, Kevin, came out to see us off, the thoughtfulness of the staff never stopped. It was always attentive without being intrusive. All of the staff; the food servers especially Yoga, pool staff, the Chef, and even the room service runner; were always polite, considerate and genuinely concerned for your comfort.
I could go on and on about this hotel but instead I will leave it with ""if you are looking for a first class hotel in Bali, stay at the Legian..I am 100% positive that you will love it and you won't want to leave!"".
Thank you Legian for the best memories of our SE Asia trip!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1408,"A stunning hotel, with a few hidden downsides.....",40,May 2014,"First off, it's only fair to say that overall this hotel is simply stunning. The location; the staff (special mentions to Eddy, the Food & Beverages manager, and head chef Luke MacCleod); the ambience, the rooms (huge!); the best hotel pool I've ever seen - 3 tiers, all infinity pools; their flexibility in allowing me a 4:30 pm checkout to match my flight time; almost, almost everything.

....but not quite.

The hotel security staff also control the traffic entering and leaving the hotel. With whistles. Which they start to use - virtually continuously - from 7:30 am. Don't plan on a late lie-in after a night on the tiles!
Being a musician, the out of tune piano in the restaurant was particularly uncomfortable, almost unbearable. I understand that high levels of humidity can cause pianos to go out of tune very easily, but with all the other things The Legian gets right, a piano tuner once or twice a week would be a good investment. And a better pianist.
My bed attacked me! On my first night while I was getting into bed the pole on the side of the bed holding up the mosquito net decided to fall out of it's socket, cutting my head. It was only a glancing blow, but there was blood everywhere (I have photos if anyone's interested). I decided not to report this to the management, just to see how long to would take for the incident to be reported to them by the cleaning staff, and for them to mention it to me. Nothing! Not even when I checked out and the manager and his under manager came and saw me off. I can anticipate the management's response to this review, saying ""if you'd reported it we'd have done.....something (what?)"". Well maybe you should train your cleaning staff to report matters like this, rather than put the onus on the guest. Enough said.
The 'mood' lighting in the bathroom was OK (just) for me, but then I don't wear makeup. For a woman (sorry, don't mean to be sexist) it must be a nightmare. Standing in front of the washbasin looking into the mirror, the downlight from the ceiling - the only light in that part of the bathroom - missed me by about a foot. Even shaving was done by memory.

Two more issues that were not the hotel's fault but which I mention as a guide to the area: 1) out of five of the days I stayed there, swimming in the sea was prohibited on four of them because of the strong waves and currents, and 2) the street hawkers in Seminyak were the most aggressive I've come across (I'd previously visited Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Hong Kong). If, as you generally tend to do, you say a firm ""no thanks"" they get aggressively vocal and a couple almost physically assaulted me, although I know who would have come off worse if they had!

So overall a fabulous hotel which, if it takes any notice of my review and resolves the issues I've raised, would be up there with the best in the world.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1409,"Wow, wow and wow.",50,May 2014,"Having spent a fantastic 3 nights in Ubud, we were looking forward to getting to Seminyak. I had heard very good things about The Legian. I am fortunate enough to have stayed at some amazing hotels in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas but I have to say, I have never experienced service like at The Legian. From senior management, to front of house staff to the gardeners and drivers - I could not find fault. It was perfectly balanced between being friendly but professional, attentive but not overly so. I'm not a fan of the kind of service which is suffocating, butlers etc - all strikes me as a bit grotesque. Other hotels and staff - take note - The Legian understands service to perfection.

The pool area and surrounding gardens are beautifully maintained. The beach is just steps in front of you (literally). For those that don't know Bali, the sea around Seminyak is not crystal clear (this is not an atoll) and the waves can be quite big, but there were plenty of families with small children playing in the surf so no problem at all. Plus The Legian has it's own dedicated lifeguard on duty.

Their rooms are gorgeous, wonderfully appointed and the food was excellent.

I am normally extremely picky and rarely go back to hotels, as I prefer to keep exploring and finding new places. But I will definitely be back here. My only complaint is that The Legian is a 5 hour flight from Hong Kong (just a tad too long for 2-3 day weekend) but there is not much management can do about that!!

We ate out at Bambu and Sardine, both of which are fabulous, particularly Bambu! Ku De Ta is pretty average and fairly commercial to be honest, as is potato head - but try them out for sundowners. Although if you're staying at The Legian - you're miles better off there! Unless you really want DJ atmosphere.

Thanks for such a memorable stay. Will be back...and cannot wait!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1410,a fantastic hotel,50,April 2014,"My wife and I and our four kids stayed at the Legian Bali for a week recently.

Overall, it was excellent. The room was spacious and very nicely appointed. The food was very good - though we did notice some inconsistencies on the nights we dined there - perhaps the head chef was off on one of those nights. The staff were fantastic, and couldn't do enough for us. Overall the standard was very high.

The hotel manager, Kevin, is excellent and is out and about making sure everything is running smoothly.

The only improvements we could suggest would be to improve the activities available for kids - there is no kids club but the hotel offers activities for kids which, while good in themselves, could be a lot better - more varied and interesting. I don't think it would be difficult for the hotel to do this - other hotels in Bali do - and I am sure guests with kids wouldn't mind paying extra for this service if it was done really well. It would improve the experience for kids and the families at the hotel immensely.

The second thing that could be done better was the way one of the guests influenced staff to reserve the prime poolside cabana every day we were there.

This annoyed many of the guests who frequently commented on how this woman and her husband always had a book from the hotel library on the cabana first thing every morning - despite never reading it, and despite arriving relatively late every morning themselves (well after the book had mysteriously appeared on the cabana).

A hotel of this calibre should not facilitate such a practice - it annoys its other guests.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1411,Peaceful Haven,40,February 2014,"Great Hotel to spend a few days, looking at that fantastic view!!!!!!

Spacious suites, great service and amazing food.

The location is right in the middle of everything, shopping, nightlife and fun.

The Spa is well worth a visit too.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1412,Amazing,50,September 2013,"Went here for our honeymoon, definite highlight of the trip! We will certainly be returning, just simply the best place to stay in Bali hands down. First class rooms, pool, and food. Topped off with the most incredible customer service ever.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1413,Excellent week at The Legian,50,April 2014,"After a busy couple of months, my spouse and I decided to spend a week at a luxurious hotel in Bali. Eventually we decided to stay at The Legian. The General Manager, Kevin Abramowicz welcomed us at the lobby of the hotel. Efficiently, we were brought to our beautiful suite. Everything in the room was perfect and very well maintained. Each morning, breakfast at the terrace was superb. The staff was most efficient and courteous. The hotel building is very well maintained and one can see that the management of The Legian have an eye for detail. Each evening, the hotel garden and building was lit by hundreds of candles which gave it a most romantic feel. When leaving the hotel last Saturday, Mr Abramowicz made the effort to wish us a safe trip back to Europe.
For us, there is only one place in Bali where we will be staying during our next trip later this year; The Legian.
We would like to thank Mr Abramowicz and his staff for making us feel so welcome at The Legian and we sincerely look forward to our next visit!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1414,Amazing!,50,April 2014,"This is an incredible 5 star boutique hotel! I've never experienced better personalised service in any luxury resort. There is an abundance of staff who are readily available to help and I found them answering my concern before I had even asked the question. The staff also address you by name, which is such a nice personalised touch. The facilities of the hotel are fantastic the pool is amazing, food and day spa all great quality so you don't have to leave the hotel. Not to mention you can have complimentary afternoon tea everyday and every night for turndown they leave a little treat in your room.

Do yourself a massive favour and if you can afford it stay here it worth it, I can't wait to come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1416,Excellence in all areas,50,April 2014,"This is a fantastic property. From the moment I engaged with their staff to make the reservation right to the time I left the property to join my flight home I can honestly say this is the best experience I've had from a hotel.

I was immediately impressed with the excellent grasp of English from the reservations team , which was mirrored by all the staff members I met in the resort.
The expedited arrivals service is excellent, as Bali airport is very busy this helps smooth you into your holiday.

On arrival we were given a welcome drink and again I was very impressed with the open, friendly and direct approach of the staff members in the front desk team. They made a point of addressing all the questions I had raised via e-mail when making my initial reservation which put me at ease.

I stayed in a one bedroom suite which was very spacious and well set-up. Everything at this resort just works, from the DVD/Blueray rental to room service and laundry, its always great service with a genuine warm smile. The spa is also excellent , both my girlfriend and I had treatments and loved them. I was originally worried about mosquitoes but the housekeeping made a point of setting up the bedroom area with plugin zappers every night and we were subsequently not troubled at all.

Food and beverage excellent - breakfast especially so. The views of the beach at night from the pool and bar areas are just amazing, I will remember this for many years to come.

I can't wait to return! Every single small thing in this resort is carefully thought out and managed - an example being the jasmine plants placed on podiums on each floor every night in a pool of light which gives a marvellous scent and zen feel as you retire - just amazing.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1417,Bali's beautiful gem,50,April 2014,"Forget the brand name hotels, The Legian is a gem in Bali's crowded hotel landscape. Exceptional yet understated service. Attention to detail like no other. And what a view...rolling breakers and the view down the beach. This is my version of Heaven. We've been back each year for the last 7 years.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1418,Well looked after at The Legian,50,April 2014,"Travelling to Bali for the first time with our 14month old baby in tow, The Legian has put my ""Bali with Babies"" nervousness at ease. We chose to stay in a spacious two bedroom suite as our little cherub is used to having his own room and ensuite thank you very much!
Cot was provided with mozzie net, the microwave set up so I can prepare any meals. Perfect.
Poolside service is fantastic and there is ample room in the two kids pools plus the adult infinity pool I front.
My Ren facial and head massage at The Spa was probably the best facial I've ever had by a lovely lady with magic soft hands.
Thank you to The Legian for helping us all to enjoy a great holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1419,Still one of my favourite hotels in the world,50,April 2014,"This was my third visit to The Legian. There is something that keeps drawing me back...the beautiful setting right on the beach, great design of hotel (which continues to be maintained with utmost care), exceptional service (from the manager to the maintenance staff) and amazing food. The rooms are spacious with large balconies. The sight and sound of the crashing waves is inspiring. I have travelled to many many places but few places have made me as happy as The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1420,Don't look past The Legian,50,April 2014,"My partner and I have stayed here more than 12 times. We've tried other 5 star properties in Bali over the years but The Legian offers the best overall 5 star Bali experience. The hotel is perfectly located overlooking Seminyak beach and it's an easy walk to several good bars and restaurants. The hotel standards are very high. The suites are large and decorated with a fusion of traditional Balinese and contemporary design. The design of the restaurant, pool and the grounds is a standout with considerable emphasis on symmetry and style. The staff also play an integral role in making your stay so complete. You will meet the GM (Kevin) or his assistant (Rohaan) at check-in or later, wandering around the hotel grounds checking that you are enjoying your stay. The other staff too seem to go out of their way to help. Whether it's Sutrarama being helpful around the pool or young Henry in the grounds enthusiastically refilling your glass with iced water at every opportunity or any of the other staff you will likely come across. The new chef (a French trained Aussie) is also having a big impact on the appeal of the hotel. The Legian is hard to fault and hard to beat.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1421,Best hotel we have ever experienced. Fabulous.,50,March 2014,I travel a lot for business flying biz class and staying at 5 star hotels (mostly American chains). This hotel and it's sister hotel in Oman are something else altogether. They are outstanding. Spend the extra $ and stay at this hotel. It is worth it. Yoga each day is fab. Room appointment is outstanding and generously proportioned. Restaurants are very good. Pools and staff are excellent. Cannot speak highly enough of this place. Love it.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1422,Beautiful Spa Experience,40,February 2014,"Had a treatment in the spa in February, it was just one of the most beautiful experience I ever had. All the ambience, settings, and details of the service protocols were just finely designed. The operational flow is so simple and smooth. The deco, shower and bathtub were all the best quality but not too much. Had an 1.5 hours Blianess massage with the windows open, I just couldn't help myself fall into sleep. So peaceful! The spa director Suwendra is really professional. Greeted us when we entered and asked our expereince when the treatment finished. Most amazing thing is the retail area. The high quality products and the arrangement of display really invited us done so much shopping. This is one of the most beautiful spas I will highly recommend.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1423,Wonderful break,50,April 2014,"We recently took a short break in Bali and were delighted with all aspects of our stay at The Legian Bali (be careful when booking as there are other hotels in the area with similar names catering to a different market).
All the staff we encountered were most attentive and extremely pleasant. We had a late flight out of Bali and the management was most helpful in letting us use our room after normal check out time so we could make the most of our last day.The pool and beach areas were great as was the overall standard of the hotel's décor. Make sure you catch the sunset! We will return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1424,Sublime Candlelight Dining at the Beach.,50,April 2014,"I've not stayed at the Legian, but I went back there this year after 17 years to find that the restaurant is as wonderful as I remember it when the hotel had newly opened in 1997. The food is delicious, try the fois gras entrée, and the service is caring and personal. I had such a great time I went back again a second night! The staff seem to really love their jobs and remember to call guests by name. The atmosphere is peaceful, romantic and very ""grown-up"". The sound of the waves breaking slowly on the shore accompanied by the classical pianist at the grand piano is so relaxing, and the view of the pool is beautiful, lit by candles and flaming torches.

The Balinese duck is a tasty specialty, the steaks are cooked to perfection and the deserts are to die for. Your waiter will be able to recommend a good wine.

When the staff asked why I wasn't staying with them, I explained that I had already booked my stays at other hotels, (after all the Legian is quite expensive), but I plan to stay with them next time if I am in Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1425,Exceptional service,50,October 2013,"...in retrospective it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in so far, in fact the best one, considering location, the weather and the whole package which comes with it. We were on a business trip to Singapore, Jakarta and Surabaya coming all the way from London October last year and it was really shame to miss the opportunity to not visit Bali when it is only an hour flight from Surabaya.
So so glad we did it!
On arrival we were very nicely greeted. Those cool aromatic towels and an air conditioned car and all those little details which makes you forget a several hours delayed flight and all other inconveniences...
and then you have that WOW factor when you arrive at the hotel at night and the area of the hotel - all candlelit and perfectly clean and very very cosy. It DOES feel cosy and homie despite the fact it is quite a big hotel.
Oh, i could go on and on about how very nice the hotel was.
The major contributing factors however were:
Huge room with a lovely day bed on the balcony overseeing the ocean
another patio with two sunbeds.
enormous bathroom with two sinks, a shower and a bath, full of aromatic candles and toiletries.
The food. This was something very special. Reading a menu is like reading a book. All very well thought through. (They have that sea food day which is a must)
The most important thing to me is the stuff who know if and when you would like their help and they make sure they are not overpowering but at the same time they are there for you if you need them. This is to me it's a top-notch.
Would definitely like to come there again and I have already recommended the hotel to some of my friends.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1426,Heaven on Earth,50,March 2014,"I recently stayed at the Legian Bali along with my three teenage daughters. I must say that it is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The most impressive feature is the staff. They were so friendly, they all knew us by name and absolutely nothing was too much trouble. Their level of service was next to none! The hotel itself is beautiful - from the rooms to the pool and grounds, it is kept in impeccable condition. I cannot think of a single thing that I would change. I will definitely be back, and I can't wait!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1427,The perfect vacation,50,March 2014,"Perfection is the word that sums up our experience at The Legian. Perfect location, perfect setup, perfect room, perfect pool, perfect food, perfect service, perfect perks, perfect breakfast, perfect everything.

We stayed in the two-bedroom suite and it was HUGE (bigger than my 2 bedroom apartment!). An iPod dock with two pre-loaded iPods, Bose speakers in every room, a sampler of fresh new cookies every day, fresh fruit...everything in our room showed us that this is a place where the staff really care....down to the little poems left on the bed every evening, that brought a smile to our faces every time we read them. We felt so at home, we did not want to leave.

The service was flawless. The staff knew all our names and addressed us personally everywhere we went: at breakfast, which was YUMM (the waffles were to die for!) at the pool deck, where the staff kept a close eye on guests to make sure our towels were always perfectly placed on the sun beds and our cups of water were always replenished, at the spa where the balinese massage was spectacular, etc.

The management of this hotel clearly knows a thing or two about running a tight ship. The GM was often seen walking around the hotel and the pool area talking to guests. He even made it a point to greet us when we checked in at 10PM!! Not to forget the cocktails evening that was organised by the hotel's management to allow them to meet and mingle with the guests (and to allow the guests to meet each other). The marketing and sales director spent around 20 minutes talking to us - we caught up on Dubai stories!

While the hotel is an excellent honeymoon location, it's also great for families or a group of 4 girls (like us) looking for relaxation and pampering...

Highly highly HIGHLY recommended!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1428,Excellent help in an emergency,50,March 2014,"Recently we were enjoying a few day vacation at this hotel after a cruise from Sydney and my wife developed a very bad coughing attack. I contacted reception to find a local doctor and they advised that they employed a registered nurse who was sent to our room immediatelly.
She dispensed medication and stayed in close contact with us until we left to return to Australia.
The general manager and other staff were also most attentive and provided wonderful support.
It sure pays to stay in good hotels .",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1429,Honeymoon perfection,50,March 2014,"Spent 6 nights in The Legian for our honeymoon. It was amazing - the room, the grounds,staff, food, yoga - especially the breakfast. We couldn't fault one thing about it and we are already dreaming of returning sometime soon!

Nothing really to add that I didn't read in other reviews except that its also a great location in seminyak - very quick and close walk to Ku De Ta, Potato head.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1430,Wonderful - thats sums it up in one word,50,March 2014,"We stayed at the legion for 3 nights having stayed at its sister hotel in Ubud. our room was HUGE - and really well equipped, with king side bed, table and chairs and full seating area, bose sound system and everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The balcony had a table and chairs and a full day bed and a beautiful view of the ocean.

The hotel staff are fantastic - the team really understand service with a smile, and nothing is too much for them. They knew that i needed gluten free food, and everyday would ask if i want GF croissants, GF toast, etc.The breakfast is buffet and a la carte, but you can also order off menu with no problem.

The hotel has a beautiful view onto the beach, which means it gets wonderful sunset views too, and in fact the word ""wonderful"" sums u this hotel in one word.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1431,Very Good,40,March 2014,"Good Hotel,,and easy to go to some where, to find eat and shoping, easy to beach vise versa to Hotel, Good Hotel,,and easy to go to some where, to find eat and shoping, easy to beach vise versa to Hotel,",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1432,This really is a top class hotel,50,February 2014,"We returned to our room after the beach and there were no less than three pairs of sandals outside and that was just for the turndown! It's just an indication of the level of service in this superb hotel. I've stayed at some fantastic places and The Legian is up there with the very best of them.

The rooms are exquisite. Our two bedroom suite had a huge lounge and diner along with a kitchen, two bedrooms and two en-suites. The balcony was enormous and overlooked the ocean. There were a couple of things that went wrong but these were fixed within 20 minutes which was very impressive. The main bedroom had a four poster bed and a mossie curtain. This did make it a little hotter but it's easy to fix - just turn the AC down a little. I really don't know what the other reviewer who gave this superb hotel a one star was moaning about. And no, there were no Mosquitos in the room either.

Breakfast is just what you'd expect and has pork sausages and pork bacon which is not always the case in these parts.

The pool concierge, Sutra looks after you from day 1 and everyone seems to know the guests' names. The snacks by the pool are really good and dinner is superb with the proviso that the choice of starters is a little limited. There's 3 infinity pools but the waves in the sea are quite large and along with the red warning flags, may put some less accomplished swimmers off with good reason.

The location is good for other restaurants (we particularly liked the Ku De Ta and Breezes at the Samaya and Teatro is only 10 minutes walk away). There's a shop called the Bottle Club just opposite that sells wine for a reasonable price for Bali - I'm talking £15 for a reasonable bottle of something you'd pay a fiver for in the UK but that's Bali wine prices for you. There's two ATMs in the mini market across the road and also a laundry down the road that does a week's worth of washing for four people for £10. As regards the rest of Seminyak it is much of a muchness and you could be almost anywhere in SE Asia.

The young Swiss manager makes his presence felt and always says hello and addresses you by name. He's doing a hell of a job because although the Balinese character is one of giving great service, the staff are so highly trained that nothing slips through the net.

How could they improve? Not a lot really. The bedroom doors don't do a lot for privacy, the safe could do with a light and the pool could do with a shower but these are very minor items.

I don't think I'll be making a return to Bali (too far and other places to see) but if I did I'd certainly stay here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1433,Relaxing Retreat,40,March 2014,"Nestled away in the seemingly narrow and bustling streets of Bali is a lovely gem. Once inside the hotel ground the rest of the world ceases to exist. Manicured grounds, well placed and classic Indonesian decor and art... fish ponds all around.... you really do feel on holiday the minute you set foot into the reception. We stayed in one of the hotel' suites... which worked very well for us and our 3 children (age range 8yrs to 2yrs). The suite was very spacious, well decorated and just begged you to unwind and relax... with a day bed on the balcony overlooking the wave crashing in on the beach.. even the children feel asleep lulled by the sound of the waves.
With babysitters caring for the children my husband and I indulged in two hour spa treatment then enjoyed dinner outside by sunset. I cannot express how simply relaxing the spa treatment was followed by the impressive dinner menu of simple yet beautifully complimentary ingredients.
We spent a day poolside... which is a stumble away from the beach, with the sea breeze, cocktails and champagne keeping us cool with ever present security guards making us feel very safe. The weather was perfect outdoor tropical weather... sun sun and lots more sun. The staff were very friendly quick and eager to help. This location worked well for us as a weekend retreat and I would happily recommend this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1434,Exquisite hospitality,50,February 2014,"We did a lot of research in TripAdvisor before choosing a hotel in Bali to spend our honeymoon, and finally settled on The Legian. It was absolutely the right choice for us.

From the very first moment of your arrival, you feel welcome. The staff are friendly and always, always smiling. Check-in is done for you while you sit in the beautiful lobby with shelves full of books and beautiful Balinese art, and the hotel manager (Kevin) takes the time to introduce himself and wish you a great stay. From there on, the staff learn your names and greet you by name every day with a smile. They are truly friendly and enjoy their jobs, which makes guests' stays so much nicer.

Our room was on the third floor and it was stunning. We had been upgraded to a one bedroom deluxe suite with a lounge, dining area, bedroom, gigantic bathroom and a lovely balcony overlooking the ocean with a day bed for lounging/reading.

Our days were pretty relaxed, which is what you want on a honeymoon. In the mornings my husband went to the gym while I took advantage of the most excellent yoga classes (I am a yoga teacher so I know quality). After that, we had breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the pool area. An example of the level of attention to detail at The Legian is that when they brought us bread and I turned it down because of a gluten intolerance, gluten free bread and croissants were produced for me with no fuss. I was utterly delighted as I have never eaten gluten free croissants in London! The breakfast, apart from your typical Western fare, also has an Indonesian section with delicious nasi goreng, miso soup and similar.

After breakfast we parked ourselves by the pools. Again, the level of service is impeccable. You get to choose your day bed/lounges and the staff will immediately place a parasol nearby, put fresh towels on your daybed, and bring you a tray with refreshing towelettes and water. We never ordered from the poolside menu but it looked promising with a good selection of juices and snacks. The infinity pools are stunning and very well maintained, and the grass around the pool area very well tended to.

Another example of how friendly the staff are was when one of the porters noticed we always stopped by the ponds on the way to our room to look at the koi fish and he gave us a packet of fish food to feed them. Such a lovely touch.

In the evening, some days we dined at the restaurant, some days we had room service and others we went out. The restaurant food was of really good quality and the setting is perfect for a romantic evening. In-room dining was also a great experience; they go to great lengths to prepare your food and make it look beautiful on the dining table, and are always prompt to come and collect the dishes once you are done. We also found the laundry service to be very quick and efficient.

Another lovely touch is that in the evening, when they turn down your bed, they leave a little snack on the dining table with a card that describes what it is, and also another card with a poem and a flower on the bed. These are the details that take the service from very good to exceptional.

Must not forget to mention the spa - we had a complimentary Balinese couples massage and it was so good that I went back for a hot stone massage. The settings for the spa are immaculate and the therapists very, very good.

All in all, we can only say good things about The Legian - we stayed there for two full weeks and didn't get bored or tired not for even one minute!

The last thing that I would like to mention and that, again, makes their level of service exceptional, is that on our last day we discovered there had been a misunderstanding between the travel agency and the hotel regarding our meal plan. We were a bit worried about this but it was resolved by the hotel with absolutely no fuss - really impeccable service.

We look forward to going back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1435,Another Wonderful Holiday,50,February 2014,"In February 2014 my husband and I had another wonderful stay at The Legian Seminyak. We stayed for nine nights. I can’t remember how many times we’ve stayed here now, but each visit has been a wonderful experience.

The grounds at the hotel are looking incredibly immaculate and lush. The outlook towards the ocean from our hotel room was pretty spectacular; a tropical picture postcard perfect aspect. We ordered room service for dinner on our balcony one evening (which was really beautiful) and we were lucky to have a great sunset as the backdrop. Dinner was scrumptious. I had truffle risotto with scallops. The flavour was incredible, and the scallops were beautiful fat, juicy, tender and tasty. It was one of the best meals I’ve had in a long while. I’d highly recommend people staying in the hotel to try the in-room dining with a bottle of nice wine at sunset. It’s a fabulous experience.

I went to the yoga sessions every second day, which were great. The instructors were friendly and explained everything very well. From the sessions I went to, there were four different instructors giving us a variety of experiences. The sessions were fun, but were still a good workout (good stretching, balancing, strength and relaxation sessions).

Thank you very much everyone at The Legian for another fantastic holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1436,Beautiful classy hotel,50,February 2014,"Don't expect a scene at this hotel. It's a quite place right on the beach with some amazing infinity pools. The service is amazing. I had a problem with ants in our room, but the staff quickly took care of the problem and comped us two massages for our of troubles. Personally I thought the beach was not great. There was trash washing up and not much effort to clean it up. If I had the choice, I would have stayed the bulk of my trip near ubud. All in all, this hotel is amazing and has an incredible spa.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1437,The Bestest Hospitality,50,February 2014,I chose this hotel for my special anniversary and my decision was absolutely correct. I have never had such perfect service in my life. The stuff greeted me with calling my name every time they came upon me. They allowed me to enjoy silence but asked me if I was all right before I felt isolated. I was able to have a great time for my special day and I'm looking forward to visiting them again in the future.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1438,Wow - Exactly what our 'mind' hoped this would be,50,February 2014,"The Legian Bali is worth every dollar you spend (as it is a premium hotel!) ..... Every aspect of this hotel is top-shelf (the staff, the places to eat/drink, and the grounds). Your right on the ocean (elevated) with 3 infinity pools at your disposal and everything you need at your disposal. The staff is right there to help, but not overboard like someplace where they are right-on-top-of-you. Don't forget the breakfast that is included in the price --- truly gourmet affair that can probably have you skip lunch - making the value even better.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1439,Simply perfect,50,January 2014,"As repeat guests to The Legian our most recent visit in January this year was a wonderful reminder of just how exceptional this hotel really is. This is truly a 5 star hotel on a world scale. Upon arrival the hotel provides an immediate sense of tranquility which continues at every touch point. The service provided by management and staff is exemplary. The secret to this hotel is in the detail which is found at every level. We were touched that some staff who we had met over previous visits remembered us and were
genuinely interested to greet us as old friends. We love The Legian and cannot recommend it highly enough if you are looking for a special place that consistently delivers on it's promise. P.S. It really does look like the photos on the website! Thank you Kevin and your staff we hope to be back soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1440,Luxurious Oasis,50,February 2014,"We recently stayed for 4 nights at The Club at The Legian which is part of The Legian but across the road from the main hotel and is a series of private villas with a private club area and lap pool for guests. It truly is an oasis of a destination; complete privacy within the one bedroom villa yet with all the benefits available at the main hotel complex if you so desire. The 24 hour butler service (Nura was incredible!), the on call car service to take you anywhere in the local area and the evening cocktails were fantastic touches (and all included) on top of the incredible service from the entire staff. Nothing was too much trouble; every time we requested something it was delivered with enthusiasm and a smile. As per some other reviews, the villas are a little on the dark side and some aspects of the villas are probably due for some upgrading but overall these were relatively minor and we would go back tomorrow!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1441,A perfect hotel in a perfect location,50,February 2014,A first class hotel run by first class staff from management to gardeners very friendly and very accommodating. The hotel is far enough away from the hustle and bustle of seminyak square area but close enough to walk to the shops and excellent restaurants.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1442,The Hotel much nicer than the Club,40,February 2014,"Having only just left Bali yesterday I am already missing it…Our first stay at the Legian was in the Club Villas located in a totally separate building across the road, really I should have researched this a little better, as I had booked 4 nights here...when I mentioned to my friend I was staying here she said ""Oh for that money you could get much better"" and she is someone who knows her Bali..the Villa's are a little old, our Villa #2 had a broken awning over the outdoor bath area, and the garden in fact most of the gardens seem to be suffering a black fungus mould which looks dreadful, the pool area can hardly be described as a tropical oasis which is a shame, staff of course were very good, I would not stay in a Villa here again its dated and dark, and you feel isolated although some might say its classically decorated. ..The hotel though is amazing, I loved everything about our beautiful huge 1 bedroom ocean view room and found the hotel although quite large felt like we were staying in a boutique size hotel, staff here were unbelievable, always beyond helpful, the pool area at sunset is the place to be…our transfers were 5star, and I am really trying to work out how we can come back again with our kids",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1443,Our second stay was even better than our first...outstanding!,50,February 2014,"We stayed at the Legian for four nights last week. Everything was just perfect. The staff was friendly and couldn't do enough to accommodate our family. We were traveling with two young children and our room was spacious and well appointed, with a beautiful view of the pools and ocean. There was plenty of room for our toddler to play and for all of us to have plenty of space. The bedroom was perfectly dark and the bed was was extreamly comfortable. We all enjoyed great sleep while we were there.
We had a wonderful babysitter for two days, which allowed my husband and I time to enjoy relaxing near the beach. The waves were too rough for swimming in the ocean, but the pools were refreshing and very well maintained, looking out over the ocean. I enjoyed walking on the beach every day, but there seemed to be even more trash in the water and on the sand than I remember from our previous stay. This could have been due to the rough waters or there could be more pollution, either way, the Legian does a much better job cleaning up the beach debris than the other hotels on the same beach do. I cannot say enough good things about the Legian's pool and beach area. The chairs are very comfortable and the whole area is quiet and relaxing. The pool waiters are friendly and very quick to bring another drink or refill water glasses. My only suggestion would be to add a few more covered cabanas. Last Saturday was very windy for much of the day. The hotel staff could not put out beach umbrellas due to the wind. There were only two covered cabanas that offered any protection from the sun and they were both occupied.
The concierge was quite helpful and offered us some great restaurant suggestions. There are many good restaurants within walking distance from the hotel.
Everyone working for the hotel seemed to remember our children's names and went out of their way to smile and say hello to them. Waiters would even offer to hold our baby while we ate breakfast. Speaking of breakfast...it's delicious! We usually skip breakfast but we remembered how good it was last year and made sure to enjoy it every day during our stay.
Last year while staying at this hotel we had a late flight and they offered us a really late check-out time for no extra fee. We didn't need to take them up on the offer, because we were visiting the other side of the island for the rest of our last day, but it was a generous offer and shows how well run and thoughtful the hotel management our.
Everything about our stay was wonderful. We hope to return again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1444,Very High Standards,50,February 2014,"Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Every aspect of the function of this hotel is carried out both very professionally but with very pleasant and accommodating staff. This is of course reflected in the rates for the rooms but you are getting what you are paying for.
The suites are spacious with character, very well outfitted with attention to detail. Good size bathrooms, nice to see a hotel that does acknowledge that people don't want an audience when they go to the toilet!.
The restaurant was also good with a very good wine list.
Big balcony with big day bed to relax and watch the sun go down.
Very close to all the other restaurants etc. but totally secluded from them when by the pool or grounds.
The gym is well equipped for whatever you need and the spa was also very good.
During our stay the wind was quite strong and the sea was rough resulting in considerable litter being washed ashore. Nothing that the hotel could do about this but nice to see that they had 5-6 people on the beach late afternoons cleaning up as much as they could for their stretch of beach.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1445,Love this hotel!!!,50,January 2014,"Wonderful staff-- helpful and friend, accommodating and just plain beautiful!! Hotel is within walking distance to a lot of great restaurants (Merah Putih) or a super affordable cab ride to almost anywhere under $5USD!! I walked to Seminyak Square and the beach was right there. All day!! I had a late flight, asked for a late check out and concierge offered me one at 7pm! That's a first for me.. 7pm? Thank you Legian for a wonderful stay!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1446,"WOW, Awesome , expections exceeded",50,January 2014,"I have stayed at a fair few hotels in the last few years, this one wasn't the cheapest (but also wasn't the most expensive)..but certainly was the best!
The property is absolute water front and in what me and my wife believe probably the best part of Seminyak.....very close to the centre of Seminyak and square but is also ocean front...
You couldn't fault the presentation of the hotel, it was immaculate...and presents straight out of a magazine....But like all experiences that are exceptional it was the staff and the service that were second to none!
The breakfast was amazing, the staff remembered our names (despite having hundreds of rooms) and would make up virtually anything on our request list. I joked to the wife that we should try ordering a Mongolian mountain yak with sun dried Peruvian limes and they would probably make it for us!
As they say though you can tell a persons character from how they treat the waiter/waitress.. In this case this was relevant with 'The legian' corporate and how they treated our local balinese babysitter...She commented how friendly they were to her when coming and going..also remembering her name, offering her assistance and being very polite to her...something she says is not common for her at Bali hotels...
Anyways I could go on and on, too many features to list them all here but all in all an experience that will certainly be remembered, we will be back, exceptional hotel!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1447,Beautiful hotel,40,January 2014,"I think the room and facilities were great. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor and loved the view.

I also got an opportunity to view my sisters accommodation - it was a little dark and damp so she transferred into another room without any problems. She stayed in a 1 bedroom room which was also lovely with garden and water views.

The gym was great with quite a lot of equipment. They also had free yoga classes every day.

The hotel food was nice and we ate there for dinner one night. Fairly reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant. Everything was free (water, juice, soft drinks and few hotel snacks) except the alcohol and Evian/Perrier mineral water in the rooms.

The service was nice and friendly but not exceptional. This on the other hand wasn't too bad as some hotels can be too 'in your face'. But overall a delightful stay and we enjoyed the room!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1448,Incomparable holiday,50,January 2014,"From the moment we arrived at the airport, our hotel service was phenomenal. With the ""VOA"" service, we were met at the airport, before immigration, and speedily whisked through this process. We literally went from the last ones off of the airplane to the first ones out of the airport. From there we were handed off to our driver from the hotel, who transported us effortlessly, in comfort, directly to the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel, the check in service was speedy and very welcoming. We had a simple studio suite which was far more room than we needed, elegantly appointed, and with a fabulous view of the ocean. The only thing better than the facility itself was the staff. The people and the service that they provide is amazing. All staff are friendly and eager to assist in any way possible. The location of the hotel in Seminyak is perfect for those wanting to venture off of the property. Hotel staff directed us to a variety of fine restaurants and shopping areas, all easily within walking distance, and even made dinner reservations for us. The staff and management should be extremely proud of the facility and service that they provide and I would like to thank them for what my wife has described as ""the best vacation ever"",",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1449,"Stunning, amazing staff, wish it wasn't so far away!!",50,September 2013,"Beautiful beautiful hotel, totally worth every penny spent. 

We stayed here for 9 nights of our honeymoon. We had a one bedroom suite, and it was huge! A large living area, dining area with reasonable size dining table, large balcony with a double lounger/ sunbed type thing on (which we spent many many hours sitting on chatting and admiring the sea view), very large bedroom, huge on suite bathroom with a shower, an oversized bath, and an island unit with 2 sinks, additional 'guest' toilet, the list goes on!

Amazing service, they literally couldn't do more for you. They provide plug adapters, a beach bag, a mosquito incense thing for the balcony, 2 iPods to use during your stay, soft drinks and snacks for use in your room, all small details that really do just make all the difference and make you feel very very spoilt :) . The service is always friendly, never 'snobby' like some other luxury hotels I have stayed in.

The pool area is very very nice, three levels of infinity pools, all different depths, and you can go down steps straight onto the beach (although note that the sea isn't great for swimming, big waves, so we stuck to the pools). Service around the pool is great too, someone greets you on arrival, helps get you set up, brings towels etc, always someone around to order drinks and snacks (as is standard for hotels, fairly pricy compared to outside but nice too), help you with parasols etc. They provide ice water all day which ey bring to your sunbed, and also bring round occasional little snacks, sorbets etc. There is also great security, always someone around keeping watch at the steps to the beach, which not only makes you feel very very safe but also looks pretty flash too :). As I said, they really couldn't do more for you. 

One small niggle around the pool would be that some of the sunbeds are located on grass, so, as we visited at end of summer, there were areas that were pretty much just mud, which isn't nice when walking from the pool with bare feet. Could be improved by building an additional path or decking.

Food is good, we generally ate lunch here each day for convenience, and had a couple of dinners too. Expensive compared to local area but good quality food and overall atmosphere and setting is nicer than you can really get in seminyak town, so each option has its benefits. Breakfast is nice, they serve you hot breakfasts (good selection of full English, eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles etc), and then there is a buffet selection of fresh exotic fruit, cereal, bread, cakes etc, really nice stuff and plenty to choose from. 

Seminyak itself has some good restaurants, at very very reasonable prices for the quality of food you get, but the set up of the town really lets it down. The two way street is narrow and very busy with traffic, both cars and motorbikes, and the pavements are more or less non-existent, which makes it difficult to walk around, and means you don't get to make the most of what is on offer there. We usually just went to a restaurant and then headed back to our hotel. 

Overall absolutely perfect if, like us, you are looking to have a nice lazy time around the pool, with the added option of going into town for more food and shopping options. We love this place, such a shame it is so far from home!! I would recommend this hotel in an instant, you will not regret your decision!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1450,Like a star,50,January 2014,"From the minute you step off the plane and are welcomed by the friendy well presented airport team. To being ushered to the fast track of customs and immigration, missing the cattle pack. Through to your bags being picked up and transferred to the trolley. The black stylish car arrives as you do, and the tranisition is a smooth as one could ask for. Seated in the car and greeted by the driver I looked back at our plane friend that we had met, who was still waiting in line for customs and I said to myself, I sure chose the right hotel!
One gets the impression of being a movie star for an instant with such an effecient and warm welcome to the hotel.

Upon arriving they served a fresh welcome lemongrass tea, the paper work was taken care of within minutes as were the bags.
We even had the pleasure of meeting the General Manager Kevin who has a pride and passion for his hotel that is rare to see and that is followed throughout the team.

The rooms are amazing,we had the pleasure of a one bedroom villa that is fully equipped with Ipod's, huge TV, great surround sound system, seperate bath (with an amazing amenities package), shower and toilet with one sink for me and the other for madame. The fridge is full of very good quality juices, soft drinks and imported beers. For coffee lovers there is a Nespresso, what else?
Upon turn down the HK team transforms the bed with the curtains around the bed and leaves a daily treat on the table from the pastry team in the kitchen.
There are afternoon teas available, beach restaurants and the fine dining during the evening. The breakfast is very good with many options that can be cooked a la minute from the menu. A great way to start the day! The food overall was excellent.
We heard from the Food and Beverage manager that they are recruiting a new Australian/French chef and that all of the menus will be changing again soon.
The spa is out of this world and madame was in heaven there. We will be back as soon as possible. A big thanks to all of the team.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1451,"Paradise on earth, but choose room wisely",50,July 2013,"We had a fantastic experience at the Legian, but the building was initially planned for condos and then got converted into a hotel. So you need to choose your room carefully. Some of us had a villa, some of us had a junior suite (the smallest room but already quite spacious) and some had the chance to use the best 2 bedroom suite.
Villas: quite old already but in good condition. Very dark and intimate, would recommend for young couples who need total privacy.
Junior suite: the best value in our opinion: spacious, with a great balcony overlooking the ocean.
2 bedroom: here is the downside the second bedroom faces the back of the hotel, i.e. the parking and the road. So ok for young children who don't care about the view, but if 4 adults then obviously there might be some issue here. But the space is great nevertheless.
Now to the best part: the gardens, pools & beach. Simply perfect and that is where you will obviously spend most of your time. Lying in the infinity pools and letting the sky merge with sea and the pool is such an enchanting experience.
Breakfast was great too, wonderful sea views and great service.
Some rooms (villas & suites) come with butler privileges and free transportation a great plus to move around and book the fashionable venues around Seminyak. We had a fantastic butler who was anticipating all our needs.
Finally many thanks to the careful attention of the hotel management (Kevin) who made sure we had a great stay and decisively intervened when we raised some concerns.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1452,Luxurious,50,January 2014,"We were celebrated our anniversary and my birthday in Bali. The Legian is a wonderful luxurious hotel. The staff was super-helpful and the hotel is in the best location - everything is right out next to your door. The villa was modern, large, very quiet and comfortable.The room service people were so polite and helpful. The barman mixed sensational drinks and it was the perfect place to unwind at the end of the day. The swimming pool and the beach was very nice and clean. We can't comment on their spa, as we did not try it.
We stayed there for 4 days and would highly recommend this fabulous hotel.
We celebrated my birthday at Ju-Ma-Na Restaurant, about 45min drive from the hotel - You must try that place also 5 star food, service and view.....",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1453,Sensational Stay,50,December 2013,"My husband and I stayed at The Club Legian in a Villa between 21st December 2013 - 3rd January 2014. The trip was sublime. We have visited Bali extensively in the past 8 years - mostly in Seminyak which is our favorite spot. We have stayed in Villas as well as Hotels. This trip was by far the most enjoyable because of the quality of service and attention provided by the management and staff at The Legian.
The Villas are beautiful, well furnished and very private. The Club Legian benefits which include the services of a Butler was outstanding. The mini bar including alcohol (Gin, Whiskey and Vodka) and snacks (M&Ms, Peanuts and crisps) were all complimentary and replenished daily. The laundry service was also one of the best features of this service. All clothes were collected daily, laundered, ironed and re-hung back in the wardrobe each day. Coming home with no washing to do is such a luxury.
Our Butler Yoni epitomized exactly what a Butler should be – highly attentive, discreet and unobtrusive. In addition she understood and spoke perfect English. She was there when we needed her and absent when we didn’t. Nothing was too much trouble – she even travelled to Denpasar to collect a prescription that we could get locally. That is true service. The little touches were also very thoughtful. My husband wasn’t too well for a day or so and we returned to our villa after popping out to find a message written in peddles on our pathway saying “Hope you feel better soon”. Such a simple gesture but very personal which is rare nowadays.
The General Manager Kevin made an effort to find us and introduce himself early in the holiday. He is professional and very attentive. His team including the staff in the Spa, the restaurant, around the pool, the drivers, concierge, front desk all speak and understand English exceptionally well. They are all highly customer service focused and committed to making every guest feel attended to. We stayed at a large and very well known International hotel in Bali last Christmas and the level of service that the Legain provide leaves this chain standing. In short well done to Kevin and his team because it isn’t easy to offer this level of service on such a consistent basis.
In the spirit of offering a balanced and construction perspective for all readers I must mention a few items that I believe can be improved. The Villas whilst utterly gorgeous are very dark both day and night. Maybe a few simple upgrades in the lighting department would make them a tad lighter. It was the rainy season when we were there which we were aware of. That meant a few days were spent in the villa. Some of the time we spent watching television. The furniture in the living room (1 sofa 2 chairs) whilst aesthetically lovely to look at wasn’t that comfortable to lounge on for longish periods of time. Also the TV by today’s standards was tiny. Plus there was only 1 TV in the villa (in the Living area) which meant that I didn’t have the option of watching something different to my husband. In other hotels/Villas that we have stayed at there is usually a TV in the bedroom and Living area – and sometimes one in the bathroom! One final observation which I apply to all hotels that have Villas in Seminyak – why are they built in an area aware from the Ocean. I understand the need to create seclusion and privacy but it is a shame that you can’t do that whilst also trying to give the guest an aspect that includes the beach and Sea. When we go back to the Legian which we are this year in August we will opt to stay in one of the Suites that face the Ocean – it’s such a beautiful aspect. I hope this is helpful to all that read it !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1454,best hotel in bali,50,December 2013,"absolutely the best hotel in bali. the service is beyond expectation and the rooms is spacious and luxurious, with some balinese touches. all rooms have spacious balconies that overlooks the indian ocean. the beach is beautiful with waves you can play with. the poolside service is top notch. food, however, is mediocre and way overpriced (a small glass of mocktail costs $10.) i suggest walking to the nearby restaurants (trust me, there's a lot) and dine out, which is way more interesting and get to see more people. the SPA is also wonderful and always provides excellent treatment for a reasonable price. they have a brand new gym equipped with the latest technogym equipment and offers daily complimentary morning yoga sessions!

oh, and this hotel is a gay-friendly hotel, so those of you who are homophobic please stay away. well, bali itself is pretty gay-friendly, so its normal to see some walking around (or almost-naked on the beach) haha. love bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1455,review from local,40,December 2013,"Having read the recommendation from trip advisor, we decided to fly to Bali from Jakarta and stay for three days. Our intention was just to play in the beach as we have toddler with us. And everything that makes him happy, makes us happy. We arranged hotel pick up, and like the driver who drive very nice and know about our favourite Bali Band, the SID. We stopped by at green and grocer for blueberry smoothies and headed to hotel. Love the early preparation they made during checkin. no hassle or que at all. We were just being asked for ID, and some signature. The room was beautiful. although it was not quite the beach view we were expecting. It was located right behind the spa place.And the spa place kind a blocked our view.But then there was a beautiful koi pool, that kind a make up to it. The bed was very comfy. Our favorite part, definitely was the swimming pool and the beach was very beautiful. We had a perfect sunset. We went to Kuta the next day and realized we actually paid for what we were having, means seminyak has got to be the best place to see sunset. Wind was strong, but then the weather was good. The only flaws probably was the breakfast. But then of course our opinion is subjective. Being a restaurant owner, we found that the Indonesian food definitely need some review. We tried the fried rice, fried noodle, porridge, sambal, pretty much all the the ones in asian section. Those were some easy food,and a little adjustment at low cost will make them taste better. Jakarta hotels have very strong F&B and to name some like Mulia Hotel who servehoney picked up from bee nest, oven cooked bagels from JW Marriot, and some traditional Indonesian dessertfrom Ritz Carlton, Not only there's plenty of variety but taste is something matter to them.If Legian can be perfect why stop at best. Beach, swimming pool, location, room, service, ambience already excellent..why not have it perfected with unforgettable breakfast. As a whole, we love our stay and will definitely go back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1456,Best NYE,50,December 2013,"Congratulations to the management team and especially the manager of The Legian, he threw the best NYE party despite the weather conditions in Bali. Everything was set to the perfection from the food , to the ""1001 Nights"" theme party , the fireworks and especially the after party at the bar. One of the best NYE parties I have ever attended!!!!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1457,Lovely...,50,December 2013,"I'll begin by saying it was a lovely experience staying at The Legian; everyone from the GM to all the staff in different parts of the hotel were extremely helpful, kind, accommodating, and most of all, very professional, especially the people at the concierge desk; also, the rooms, the grounds, and all shared areas were impressive and well maintained. I would also like to add that we were extremely grateful that the hotel provided us with a late checkout and a room to stay in as our flight was after midnight; thank you!
I personally have one which wasn't to my satisfaction; I felt that for transportation to the hotel and the airport should have been provided. We were originally staying at a villa 4 Km from the hotel and we were not offered a complementary pick up service which I think that for a hotel of your caliber was a bit tasteless; it is the first time that I have not been provided this service anywhere in the world while staying at a first class resort.
Regardless, my experience was impressive and we do intend to return in the near future. My wife has been a patron in the past and she absolutely loved it and suggested we moved from the villa we were staying at. I want to thank Rohaan Chandra for his personal touch and his generosity, especially for making the beach soccer happen for my son after it had been previously cancelled, and for arranging our late stay, well done!!!
See you all soon!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali

1459,Service beyond the beck and call of duty,50,December 2013,"Review based on a pool villa at The Club.

Wowowowow. And that's even considering the fact that their villas are surrounded by walls and have no view.

We stayed at a pool villa at The Legian, and it's not the huge size of the accomodation, or the extra features they add in as part of the price. It's above all the incredible service mentality of their staff that stays with you after staying at this place.

Room: The villa and surrounding area is huge. It costs a fair dollar, but you won't get this space and these facilities anywhere else in the world at the same price. The big issue with these villas is there is no view of anything. They're all in walled enclosures. If you really want a sea view you're probably better off in the main hotel, where it looks like all the rooms are sea facing.

The main hotel is nice, but feels a bit restricted. Maybe we're a bit too used to big resorts once I'm on a beach, since this place is obviously much larger than The Chedi, where we moved here from... The bar by the pool faces the sea, and is nice to sit in while it's raining (that's the time of year we were there).

The restaurant serves great food, but again (as for the Chedi) it's too European for me... I ordered two Indonesian main courses when we ate there, since they didn't have a single Indonesian starter. I really never have understood why tourist hotels around the world don't serve more local dishes, or at least serve their European food with a strong local flavour twist.

The gym is very new and nice (actually, clearly one of the best hotel gyms in recent trips), but again I really, really miss a nice steam bath and sauna.

I really like that they will drive you anywhere at anytime within the Leguan/Kuta/Seminyak area, without any extra charge or any question whatsoever about distance or frequency.

Service. The big point! Blows you away. Everyone is so incredibly accomodating and helpful in any stupid little question or desire we might express. We mentioned that we really liked the nutty deep fried snacks they prepare on-site, and the next day they fixed up a demo with the chef to show me a practical demo in the kitchen with the spices and technique for making them. My wife had also taken a picture of a carved figure she liked, and asked Purna (our butler) as a by-the -way about where she could go to buy something similar. After we'd checked out and returned home, he has since investigated with local workshops and contacted us with specific references of workshops that make similar carvings, and has sent photos of similar examples of their products. And this is well after we have completed our financial business with the hotel. How is that for follow-up service and taking an interest in your guest welfare? Top marks! Thanks for your great service, Purna. (This guy is also a sharp minded fellow! One of his colleagues explained how he did so smartly at school that he got a scholarship to go and get himself a university degree in Japan, and therefore is now also comfortably conversant with the Japanese guests in their own language)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1460,Luxurious comfort around every corner,50,December 2013,"One word to describe The Legian experience: Impressive. From the warm reception upon my arrival (even the GM for the hotel made sure if there was anything I needed that he would make sure it happened) I knew that this hotel was not going to disappoint. From the time you get up you have complimentary yoga class, well equipped gym and spa facilities, a beautiful pool area and a delicious abundant breakfast buffet all waiting for you. The central location (200m from Seminyak Square and many good bars and restaurants) is still secluded enough where the beach is peaceful. Walk about 15 minutes towards Kuta and there's tons of surf schools and people selling stuff on the beach if that's your thing. The deluxe suite is super spacious and comfortable. The hotel staff ensures that it's tidy every time you return from an outing and in the afternoon they have the best Balinese desserts waiting for you (gratis). There are little complimentary things (drinks and snacks from the mini bar) that are pretty insignificant to the average person but I found were little touches that made me feel like this wasn't your average 5 star hotel. My only gripe had nothing to do with the hotel but watch out for the mosquitos in the room because nothing seems to stop those guys from biting (the hotel provides a curtain around the bed and mosquito repellant).",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1461,Don't get fooled by tripadvisor's rating,10,December 2013,"Not sure why this is a GMH property. We couldnt beleive this is rated number one on tripadvisor. Usually they much more accurate than this.

The arrival experience is highly unimpressive. The building itself feels tired and dated. A 3 stars at best in terms of quality and finishes. The images used on the GMH website are not representative at all for what you'll get. We were told that we were given un upgrade to the suite we reserved. The suites are too large to an extent they feel empty and impersonal. The interior is very poor with a couple of corners made to be picture ready. Shower floor made from textured and porous material which is difficult to clean; we had to wear slippers to shower. If this is the upgraded situation, not sure what the less lucky got!

Service: room wasn't properly cleaned when we received it and stayed that way until our third day after we left a tip note on the table. The bed sheets were not replaced everyday. Restaurant staff were good.

We received a suite infested with mosquitos. We're talking in the order of at least 50. Housekeeping gave us a choice when complaining to either spraying the suite with baygon or use a mosquito repellent. We asked whether we can get another suite without this issue. We were told all suits have this level of infestation. We had to hunt them one by one.

Most of the staff are very friendly, but treatment is far from genuine and basically formulaic. The GM cannot be more aloof. Showed up at checkin and literally recited a couple of lines as if he was reading from a script. Just seemed wanted to get it over with.

Bed not a real king size but rather a large double. Bed sagged in the middle. The mosquitos net is so thick we had to open it in the middle of the night gasping for air. Something in the mattress or a layer above contains polyester based material. Made us sweat all night. Never happened to us before.

Slippers had a very nice design with local roots, but caused us a rash in both feet after wearing them tomtake shower.

Good sound system. TV ok with the picture of a lot of channels as having reception problems.

Landscape and pool area well done and overlooks the beach nicely.

Some of the guests were the hippy types.

Overall experience is a negative one. Our review might be affected by the fact that we came tonthis hotel right after staying at the Four Seasons in Ubud which was a absolute pleasure. The Legian is definitely not worth what we paid for. If you are seeking luxury in this area you're better off trying at the nearby Oberoi or Samaya based on what we noticed.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1462,The Jewel in the Indian Ocean,50,November 2013,"Nestled in an alcove of the Indian Ocean is a jewel called The Legian Bali. Everything that a fine resort should be is exactly what the resort is. It is only nature in the form of the Indian Ocean that adds immense value to this great hotel. You can get lost in the natural setting of the ocean. If you have the money then go for the Sunset Suite and you will not be disappointed when you encounter the setting sun merging with the ocean in a splash of golden yellow and azure blue. There are many distractions within the resort such as the ocean bar, restaurant and the pool bar. The real cool ones are the three tiered infinity pools. Serious golfers should try the Nirwana golf course by the sea. The resort underwent a renovation drive and the property is simply superb.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1463,Nice hotel,40,October 2013,Spent 3 nights in the Legian hotel. The hotel was very busy at that time and the lobby felt a bit like a bus station.the rooms are very large and well appointed though a bit dark for my liking. The service is very good. Tried two treatments at the spa which were excellent. The restaurant is outstanding. We had 2 of our 3 dinners here.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1464,A glorious five star experience,50,December 2013,"All the positive opinions of this place are true. Incredible service, amazing and opulent suites and a great position. How the staff remember/ know our names from almost the first minute we arrived I shall never know. Deeply impressive.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1465,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!",50,March 2013,"This review is long overdue, since we visited the Hotel back in Spring. We were coming from Australia and wanted to hit the beach again in Bali. It was our second visit to this hotel. Usually second visits are disappointig most of the time, but not this one. The Legian did quite some renovations and has become even better, still perfectly situated right at the beach, sitting in a beautiful environement with palm trees and perfect gardens.

What we loved are the beautiful one bedroom suites, which are beautiful! The sunset from your balcony is just amazing. We loved the breakfast and most of all the beach with superb sunbeds, lifeguard and service. Great food for a great price (remember this is a top Hotel).

Staff is just lovely and the new Manager Kevin is doing a great Job, he can always be found on the premises, in case you have any questions. I doubt that anyone ever has any complaint.

We also liked that they offer brand new Vespa 125cc Scooters for rent in black with the THE LEGIAN logo on them. We have exact the same one at home (in trendy white however). Driving in Bali can be pretty ""exciting"" (to be modest) but if you feel comfortable driving a scooter - then take these ones, since everything is well in order.

I did my complete laundry at the Hotel by the way, almost 30 Kilos of everything. When it came back, every little item was neatly wrapped and packed or hung up in the closet and the clothes were like new. Housekeeping in general is also truely lovely.

Please make sure to book their Airport Pick Up Service. There are hundreds of people at the airport trying to give you a ride, many of them without any licence. We were so happy to meet our driver at the airport and he drove us in a great and cooled down minivan. I think it was a new service to offer an iPad during the ride so our driver was really proud about that. I wonder however what people look up on this device during the ride - but it added to the overall nice experience.

We will definately return in November - for the third time. Never did that before.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1466,"Well managed resort, excellent new gym, true 5 star service",50,November 2013,"We've spent 3 nights at The Legian after lovely three nights at their sister property, The Chedi Club Tanah Gajah in Ubud. We have received a free transport between the two resorts and received a warm welcome at The Legian. My partner and I traveled with my mom and had booked a two-bedroom suite. It's like the one-bedroom Deluxe Suite but with an extra bedroom and bathroom. Unfortunately, however, the extra bedroom faces the side away from the ocean so we changed into two deluxe suites the next day and were happy.

The rooms are massive, nicely decorated and come with free non-alcoholic drinks in the minibar that get refilled daily plus a Nesprosso machine which I appreciate for having an early morning coffee in bed. The balcony is very big, too and I recommend asking for the highest (3rd) floor as the rooms have the best seaview - over the trees.

The new gym and spa are beautifully designed and well equipped, even though the additional wellness area with saunas and steam rooms is only planned to be added in 2014. I had a 2 hour massage & scrub treatment and it was very good.

Service at the pool is very good, staff even try to remember your name. Breakfast service is friendly and staff are there when you need them. The choice and quality of breakfast was okay, although I've had a fruit selection with more choice and better quality before.

We didn't try the restaurant for lunch or dinner, so I can't judge it. It was not very crowded, however, and did not appear within the first pages of tripadvisor.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1467,Superb Bali Experience,50,November 2013,"Legian is a safe choice if you want to spend quality time in a high-class hotel in the Bali Seminyak region.

1468,Amazing experience- 5 star resort with 5 star service!,50,November 2013,"WOW where do we start? Just home from a 7 day trip to bali staying at The Legian. Absolutely amazing resort. The view, the pool, the spa, the room, the breakfast, but most of all the service!

We were in bali celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary (no kids!!) and wanted to stay somewhere special with no Marco Pollo at the pool!! After reading so, so many wonderful reviews on Trip advisor we could not stay anywhere else but The Legian. We have stayed in many 5 star properties around the world but never experienced such 5 star service. Every staff member greets you with name every time you see them. By the pool they layed your towels and then re positioned them, refilled your icy water, fabric refresher towels, complimentary green tea facial mist and foot massage. They move your umbrella up, down, side wards...they will do it all and with a REAL smile. Nothing is too big or too small.

The room itself we stayed in a spacious enough for the two of us with 2 large balconies one with sun lounges. Real extras was the daily turn down service, iPod and Bose sound system, gorgeous pool bag to use, international power plugs, coffee machine and free mini bar of all soft drinks/ juices/ water and nibbles.

Afternoon tea was another added bonus between 4 - 6pm where the coffee is delicious. The breakfast was a breath of fresh air compared to other resorts that have those terrible buffets, here you get to order from an al a carte menu and are cooked to your liking. Plus there is a selection of pastries, cereals, salads, sushi and other international cuisine available. The gardens are perfect and picturesque and there was not a person who walked along the beach that did not stop and admire this beautiful property.

Kevin the managing director was lovely he came and introduced himself early in our stay and we had a great chat with him about his wonderful resort his plans for it and we can't wait to visit again to see the next stage of his grand plans. We can see why the service is exceptional as it starts from the top. Can't recommend highly enough.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1469,The most beautiful hotel anywhere!,50,November 2013,"We stayed at The Legian for six nights in November and must say it was the most amazing experience. First, the staff is wonderful. So helpful, kind and generous with their time and information. We loved working with all of them. The room they gave us, which was more than we expected, was their two bedroom suite overlooking the ocean and pool. Okay so spectacular was the word. Immaculate, fruit every day, little notes and flowers on our pillow at night. What more can you ask for. Oh, how about the amazing buffet breakfast in the morning overlooking the ocean. The fabulous dinners at night. Maybe the location in walking distance to everywhere. We checked out other hotels near The Legian and let me say that nothing compared. We will be going back to Bali and this will be our hotel of choice. Thank you to everyone at The Legian in Seminyak (not to be confused with the Legian Beach hotel). Our vacation was more that perfect.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1470,"Outstanding service, terrific location",40,November 2013,"We stayed two nights at the Legian in November and while the weather didn't do us any favors with lots of rain, the staff certainly did. We stayed in a deluxe suite and it was spectacular with plenty of space, a large balcony, great amenities and a beautiful view over the pool and beach. Staff knew our names from the moment we checked in, no request was too large and they even arranged a late checkout for us given a night flight we had. On that point - while requests for a late checkout are common at hotels around the world, the staff at the Legian didn't make a big deal about it and we weren't left feeling like we had asked for the world as is often is the case elsewhere. When we struggled to get taxi for a dinner booking, one of the staff took us with no fuss. It was a real delight to feel so special, especially since we booked through Expedia. Great location with Kudeta and Eat Street (Jalan Laksmana) very close by and Potato Head a short walk away. Breakfast by the pool was a delight.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1471,The best hotel we have ever stayed in.....?,50,November 2013,"Okay, review number 26 and God-knows how many hotels.

To get straight to it, the majority of the reviews for this hotel reflect mine - The Legian, in a word, is 'superb.

Starting with service - the trump card at this place - we chose the VIP Visa service (honestly, time over I wouldn't bother but it was still nice). We were met within 200 yards of the plane and never looked back - walked through immigration, luggage collected and walked to the waiting car, chilled water and cold towels in the car and greeted by name when the hotel staff opened the car doors upon our arrival.

In honesty, I could stop now - the arrival experience reflects the majority of the stay - but to make sure I help as much as possible a few other things I hope will help you make your decisions;

We went here as we like smaller hotels. The place is quite large, but only seventy or so rooms. Service is by personal.

Our room was massive - the bathroom alone bigger than my bedroom!

Hotel facilities are great. Three beautifully located pools. There was a slime build up on one corner which made I slippery. The point is, before we'd even mentioned it to staff, it was treated and quietly cleaned up. Things like this happen - its the way staff respond that matters. I tried the gym, it was literally brand new, well spec'd.

Food - excellent. Breakfast was extensive and great. Room service very fast and quality good. Afternoon sorbets and afternoon tea around the pool both complimentary and both delicious. Dinner, same deal. Understandably more expensive than eating out, but just as good.

Location, the only downside - and strictly on a personal taste basis. In terms of location in Seminyak, The Legian is great. Infinity pools overlook the beach perfectly and it's pretty much in the middle of the town. The problem is Seminyak. Good grief the Government need to clean it up - beaches are simply dirty (despite the hotel cleaning it's area daily by the looks of it) and while there are great bars and restaurants, the town is full of lovely people. But it's a mess.

Don't get me wrong, we loved this place and enjoyed Seminyak, but if you're looking for great beaches and golden sand, it's not for you.

If you are looking for an amazing hotel with incredible staff and aren't took bothered about a pristine, golden beach, highly highly recommended. If we go back to Seminyak, I won't even blink booking The Legian again.

The best hotel we've ever stayed at? We have been lucky to stay at some amazing places and we love many for a variety of reasons. What I can say, is service and quality wise, The Legian is in a world of its own.

All I can close with is a thanks to incredible staff.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1472,Amazing and stunning !,50,November 2013,"A allround first class stay !
No faults or failures with anything !
Will return,without a dought !
5 star luxury !
Hotel manager was present on departure to ask if everything was in order with our stay !
A great gesture !
And appreciated,that he was thankfull of our stay at his hotel !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1473,Unforgettable!,50,April 2013,"An utterly amazing experience that was flawless in every respect, the care and details are what really blew my mind, the buffet breakfast including the best salmon i have ever tasted, the iced water that arrives with a smile while you sit by the pool and the little treats waiting for you everyday in your room. At night, there was even a poem left on my pillow. Highly recommend this breathtaking hotel. I will dream about returning to the warm, soft thee tiered pool forever.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1474,Perfect stay,50,November 2013,"Starting with a warm welcom from all the staff, the very professional and personal touch from kevin abramowicz, this was the perfect stay. No issue with late departure which very often is a problem.
It was like paradise. We will come back, and really recommand this enitre location and crew.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1475,Top drawer,50,November 2013,"We have just spent a week here on our first stay. As regulars to Bali and Seminyak since 2004 we have pretty high standards and know what to expect, but even we were very pleasantly surprised by The Legian, and will be back.

Very conveniently located walking distance to ""Eat Street"", and top restaurants / spots at the Oberoi & Kudeta, the site is right on the beach with immaculate gardens and 3 pleasant infinity pools. Each room faces the sea, and the design is such that the whole place is a peaceful spot with no outside noise bar the sea. The place is not large so there is no sense of swarms of tourists, and kid friendly with a great babysitting service. Our 7 year old even got a welcoming stuffed toy, and room service staff made a play of rearranging her toys so they were chasing each other in different ways each time they cleaned the room, something we all dervived amusement from.

The rooms are very well appointed with parquet flooring and huge living areas with high ceilings. Modern TV could take USB and HDMI feeds for those that want to bring thier own, and a Bose Ipod player was in the room as well. Free and fast wifi was prevalent throughout the complex including garden and pool areas. Our room was on the third (top) floor with a generous balcony overlooking the sea, which included a private daybed.

Room service and poolside service prices were very reasonable.

The real highlight has been the service. Hotel and restaurant staff in Bali can tend to over-service, and are renowned for trying to whisk your plate away with your last morsel of food still on the fork. Otherwise they try to avoid responsibility. Not so here. Staff were attentive to just the right level, which is pretty impressive anywhere and speaks volumes at the effort management must have put into this. Interestingly, staff seemed to have learned our names as on the first morning after we arrived we were greeted as Mr & Mrs (surname) by staff we had not met. The concierge was very effective in arranging restaurant bookings and in obtaining simcards for us as well.

A truly well-run and pleasant hotel where staff attend to all the little things as well as the obvious with perfection.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1476,Perfect,50,October 2013,"This is simple a very good hotel. staff, service amenities and room a perfect. You feel welcome. Location is great in Seminyak. Rooms are very big. Location on the beach is good. I recommend going to Ku De Ta for dinner or just sunset dring. Great loaction.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1477,4 days of bliss,50,November 2013,"We just spent 4 wonderful nights at The Legian. What the hotel does the best is all the very little things, with little surprises provided at night with the turn down service. Every staff member from the security guards at the front, to the pool attendants being very attentive. A big thank you to Dayu for always providing a service with a smile at breakfast which always started our day on the right note.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1478,"Simply awesome, outstanding!!",50,May 2013,"The hotel is outstanding, the service and staff excellent, really kind and attentive. The room amaizing, pools wordless and we had a special private dinner that was incredible. Well done guys, one of the best hotels I have seen..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1479,The best hotel we have stayed at BY FAR,50,October 2013,"We had 6 nights at this hotel to finish off our 3 week honeymoon tour and this hotel was truly amazing from the minute we stepped in.

As it was our honeymoon we had been upgraded to a One Bedroom Deluxe suite and the room was incredible, the decor was lovely and the attention to detail stunning. In the room soft drinks and snacks are included, there are iPods in case you forgot yours, Bose surround sound, nespresso machine for coffee etc.

The pool areas is lovely and is right on the beach. The waves are pretty impressive and the hotel has body boards and surf boards for you to use, there is also a lifeguard on duty watching the sea outside the hotel to keep the guests safe.

Whilst around the pool the staff cater to your every need, bringing iced water regularly, and sorting your towels etc.

We had breakfast included and the food was excellent, lunches and dinners were pricey though but you expect that at this quality of hotel. There are other places to eat nearby.

We had an hours massage for 2 in the spa and this was lovely and worth doing, truly pampered.

The amazing thing about this hotel is the attention to detail and service, at the turn down service they came in and pulled the net curtains closed on the 4 poster bed and left a lovely poem on the bed, put a mat and slippers either side of the bed, water and a glass either side and also some little snacks as a treat. They even dried the shower! Sounds odd to mention that but it is all these little things that stand out. At night you can hear the waves crashing outside which is very soothing.

We absolutely loved our stay here and there is no question of recommending this hotel, I only wish that GHM hotels were in more locations as I will definitely check to see if there is one whenever I travel somewhere now.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1480,Wonderful,50,October 2013,"We stayed for 5 nights in October as part of our honeymoon. We have traveled extensively, so when it came time to plan the honeymoon we knew we wanted something great. We were blown away by The Legian. It is now my favorite hotel I've ever stayed at. The room was big and designed perfectly. The high ceilings, the sliding doors, the poster bed, the amount of sunlight, the size of the balcony, every detail was thought through and executed beautifully. The service at the pool area during the day was outstanding. They find you shade if you want shade, fresh towels, drinks, snacks. They really pamper you. No request or task was to much everything was done with a smile all around the hotel. This is truly a luxury 5 star experience! We also loved the location. Close to ""eat street"" which has all these great restaurants, bars and cafes. We are looking forward to returning one day maybe as an anniversary celebration!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1481,Truly outstanding!,50,November 2013,"We've just returned from our honeymoon at The Legian and have had the most amazing time. From the moment we arrived, we felt special and very welcome.

We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite located on the ground floor with terrace and just a few steps to the pool. We were blown away by the room; we expected it to be special but every little detail was covered. As we were on our honeymoon we were presented with a fabulous cake and champagne - perfect touch!

Nothing seemed too much for the staff at The Legian, the service from
every area was outstanding. The food in both the restaurant and the pool bar is also excellent.

The Legian offers everything and goes above and beyond. The extra details really made us smile - afternoon tea each day, sweet treats and a poem left each evening at turn down service.

We've had the most relaxing and fabulous time and would certainly recommend The Legian to anyone travelling to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1482,Excellent at everything !!!,50,October 2013,"We stayed at The Legian Hotel for 5 nights and it was absolutely excellent time. Great location, friendly and helpful staff, beautiful and comfortable room. It was one of nicest and best place we ever stayed in. There all was perfect and thought-out for the guests. I spend my birthday at the hotel and they surprised me with cake and champagne. This place was really something special. Thank you !",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1483,"Good hotel, location and service",40,October 2013,"Stayed here for our Honeymoon. I really liked the place, the deluxe villa was good, and the welcoming bottle of champagne was a nice touch. The room itself looked out onto the sea and the Bose sound system was multi-room which was nice. The room was clean, and the room service etc was fantastic. It was great in the morning being able to walk out from the lounge and then go directly onto the beach. The hotel itself was good, with three infinity pools and two pool bars in the centre of the hotel, with sun beds/lounges spreading our on either side (offering shade or direct sun throughout the day).

the breakfast option was good with a wide range on offer, the only negative was the inability to select how I wanted my eggs done (different to the wife), and also it seems that toast may actually mean bread as well, as it was almost impossible to have the toast, toasted..... I never actually ate here, and the hotel did not seem to plug their food very much.

Overall I would recommend the hotel - it was well kept, clean and the service was good.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1484,Club at the Legian - Worth Every Penny,50,November 2013,"Yes it's expensive for a villa with private pool at the Club at the Legian, but everything really did fit together. The Legian appear to work as a coordinated team and we never at any point felt neglected or unrecognised. Our personal ""butler"" was highly trained and seemed to be able to predict our every need and desire.

The Club itself is separate from the main hotel, and feels like a considerable upgrade even over the already impressive main hotel. Whilst the Club has no sea view, it is a quiet and discrete walled-in compound of villas around an extensive main clubhouse and superb swimming pool. The pool was precisely the right temperature and was big enough for serious swimming. It was also empty most of the time. The clubhouse served free (and top notch) breakfast, afternoon tea and complimentary drinks. Everything is waiter service - no buffets - and even in the room the entire contents of the well-stocked mini-bar are free too.

Although we only could stay one night it was a truly enjoyable time and proved to me that good service is much more than an enthusiastic welcome - it takes coordination, consideration, training and experience - and the staff at the Club at the Legian were true examples of this.

I'm saving my pennies for another visit. Highly recommended for total relaxation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1485,Back Again,50,November 2013,"The really good thing about a great hotel is when you recommend it to a friend and they accept the recommendation, they love it as well. The Legian is one such hotel! Superb location on the beach, suite sized rooms, very friendly and excellent food. We have come back again and this time with a group of friends. The hotel grounds are superb and at night the vista is a fairyland, whether swimming, a cocktail or a few beers it is just a great place. I agree that the property is ageing a little but to me it helps the hotel blend into the local culture and has a very relaxed style. Last time I was here we had our young grandchildren and also found the hotel to be very child friendly. So in summary a hotel for all Seasons as such, will suit just about everyone and I will be back again and again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1486,Great location & outstanding service,40,October 2013,"We stayed at The Club at The Legian to cap off a week in Bali and it was a really nice conclusion to a perfect trip. We first stayed in their sister property (Chedi in Ubud) which was absolutely perfect, and found The Legian to be of similar quality. The staff was extremely welcoming and the rooms at The Club are amazing, offering lots of inclusions for the hefty nightly room rate. The Club is across the street from the main building and beach, a very easy 5 minute walk.

The main hotel is a beautifulyl landscaped property with a great pool and nice restaurant options. The staff was consistently looking to find ways to help and/or make your stay more comfortable. Only negative was for the price you pay for The Club, you don't get a beach view or direct beach access, which would have really made our stay perfect. Otherwise, it was a great hotel with fantastic service in a nice spot on Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1487,The Sophia Loren of Hotels,50,October 2013,"This hotel although ageing is still holding its grace and beauty. The position right on Seminyak beach is top class and a short walk to the local shops and eateries. The rooms are more like one bedroom suites and most offer mesmerising views of the waves lapping the volcanic sands. The rooms are spotlessly maintained but definitely looking tired in their fit out. Sorry to say but the grounds and restaurant although fastidiously maintained still show the signs of elegant ageing
The service at this hotel is second to none with all staff so proud to offer their guests friendly and genuine service. I think the staff are this hotels greatest asset.
The restaurant offers an excellent breakfast and cordon bleu night menu of international quality preparation and presentation. The price however is 3-4 times what you would pay outside the hotel

The experience of staying here was definitely worth the high end cost and the I've been there factor but reality says there are newer better value hotels in Bali which would offer the same experience at a much cheaper price
Just like Sophia Loren this hotel will maintain its beauty and grace but as the years go by there will be a younger more beautiful one to take its place as its reign comes to an end",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1488,Magnificent!!!,50,September 2013,"We had an amazing time at The Legian and spent two spells there both of 6 nights each. From The Manager and Assistant Manager there is a culture throughout the hotel from all the staff that the Customer is extremely important to them and the service and attentiveness and helpfulness of the staff is second to none. In a very competitive and reachable world it is often difficult to say that you would definitely recommend a hotel, and look forward to go back there, but I would have no hesitation in saying either about The Legian. Go and enjoy!!!!!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1489,Well worth all the hype,50,September 2013,"Where to start with this hotel? Wow! Our one bedroom suite was huge, with a good size dining table, desk, sofa and a large balcony/terrace with a double size day bed. The bedroom seems small in comparison to the living area but it was more than comofrtable, with a four poster bed and two good size wardrobes. Bathroom was also excellent with two sinks (one opposite sides which is perfect, it stops you being on top of each other), regular size bath and large shower. What I particularly loved about this suite was the complimentary soft drinks and the coffee machine. Bottled water is placed beside your bed, beside the bathroom sinks and in the pantry fridge there was yet more mineral water! All the soft drinks in the well stocked fridge in the pantry were complimentary, as well as the snacks and the beers/wine/spirits were reasonably priced.
Service by the pools is excellent, the staff are attentive without being overbearing and again the food and drink seemed very reasonable, actually cheaper than we expected, given the cost of the rooms.
Breakfast is very good, with continental served buffet style and then a la carte eggs, waffles etc. The Indonesian breakfast buffet was particularly good, and was a great opportunity to sample the local cuisine without committing (this was our last hotel in Bali and I hadn't tried the Indonesian breakfast anywhere else, I didn't want to risk not liking it and going hungry!).
We also had the seafood buffet experience on the beach one evening and this was also very good and well priced. A good choice of food, 3 courses and you could go back for more. For two of us plus mineral water and 7 premium gin and tonices - £100 including service.
The only criticism we could find, when we really tried, was that the pool side staff didn't offer to clean our sunglasses. This is very picky, but other, lower standard hotels have done so in the past so I was surprised that the Legian didn't offer! But one of the best hotels I have stayed in, excellent staff, beautifully appointed rooms and stunning sunsets. It's worth the expense and is a great place to end your Bali holiday in. Only a 30 - 45 minute drive to the airport.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1490,7 Days in Paradise,50,October 2013,"My family and I recently returned from 7 nights at The Legian in Seminyak. I can honestly say, this is one of the nicest resorts we have ever stayed in. The setting was beautiful and we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a Deluxe Villa which was spacious and had panoramic views over the ocean. The staff were faultless, and as mentioned in other reviews, knew each of us by name. The staff could not do enough to please us and nothing was too much trouble. The resort was central to most things including great restaurants and spa facilities. I would thoroughly recommend The Legian to anyone travelling to Bali and am already planning our next trip here :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1491,Great for honeymooning surfers,40,October 2013,"We stayed here on our Honeymoon and it was a great hotel.

The staff were friendly, exhibiting the infamous Balinese hospitality and everywhere in the hotel was clean.

The hotels proximity to Legian beach is really useful if you want direct access to the surf. The waves are punchy beach breaks and an ideal intro to the heavier reefs close by.

The food was good, especially the breakfast. I think the only downer was we probably stayed there a bit too long. If we were to do it again we'd have stayed at Ubud a few more days to get the Bali cultural vibe.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1492,Honeymoon in paradise,50,October 2013,"My husband and I stayed here for 7 nights on our honeymoon - without a doubt this is the best hotel we've ever stayed in. We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe suit, the room was lovely and big overlooking the beach. The staff were incredibly friendly, knowing us by name every time they saw us and couldn't do enough for you. The food at the hotel was delicious, including complimentary afternoon tea every day which is a must! We enjoyed a 60 minute balinese massage at the spa which we'd recommend.
The food at the hotel's main restaurant was pricey but amazing quality but there are also 2 pool bars which serve food throughout the day and evening which is more reasonably priced but still really great quality.
We would definitely recommend this hotel, it's a beautiful place to stay and the staff make your holiday a truly 5 star experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1493,You weren't expecting 4 stars were you?,50,October 2013,"This place really is something very special.

We've just returned from an 8 night holiday at the Club at the Legian. The plan was originally to visit Bali for our 20th Anniversary, but unfortunately this falls in January when the weather is, let's say 'sub-optimal'. So we went 3 months early!

Every member of staff we met, from the gentleman who we only saw briefly at the the airport, to our butler, who was omni-present when needed, yet never obtrusive (thank you Agus), they all created the impression that our having the trip of a lifetime was their number one priority.

Arriving in the villa to find flower petals on the bed and romantic music playing might sound hackneyed, but it worked perfectly in these surroundings. The villa was perfect.

We tried the chef's tasting menu in the main hotel restaurant, which included the best wagyu and foie gras I have ever tasted (sorry veggies!). The seafood indulgence on the Friday was another high point, but the food in the Club lounge was also excellent. The huge breakfast was a huge hit, with both of us. I felt compelled to try the martabak, nasi and mie goreng, finding that rice/noodles for breakfast actually works very well, especially when preceded by a fruit plate and followed by more excellent coffee. The buffet breakfast on offer in the main hotel was also first class (including sushi - tuna and salmon nigiri).

The complimentary afternoon tea and cocktails were a lovely touch; something we hadn't experienced since our stay at the Waldorf Towers in NY (10th Anniversary!)

We tried a few local restaurants - Merah Putih was our favourite outside of the hotel, and the only one to match the hotel restaurant's quality. Had there been another couple of themed nights in the restaurant, we might not have ventured out of the hotel in the evening.

The villa pool was lovely, the impressive (and almost unused) Club pool was enormous (35m), but the infinity pools in the main hotel and their surrounds were just lovely - and more comfortable for catching some sun, with the slight sea breeze.

We read all the reviews before we picked this hotel, and really struggled to find anything remotely negative, in fact it was tough to even find constructive criticism. I now know why.

The impressive hospitality continued even into to the sad 'last day'. We checked out of the villa at noon, headed to the Tanah Lot temple for our last adventure and on returning to the Club they had arranged somewhere for us to shower and change before taking afternoon tea, then finally driving us back to the airport for an 8pm flight.

The general manager is considered a 'rising star' in the hotel business, and I can see why.

I almost feel sorry for people for whom staying in a hotel like this is 'normal'. Where on earth do they go for a trip of a lifetime?

Wherever else we stay, from this point forward, it's going to have to be out of this world to compete with the Legian Bali. Thank you Mr Abramowicz and your team.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1494,The Legian is not just another hotel. It is a lifestyle experience.,50,October 2013,"We have just spent 6 days/5 nights at The Legian Bali. Strangely enough we haven't visited Bali in over 6 years and preferred to visit other countries in the Asia region.
Although living in Singapore, it was our first time in 6 years to return to Bali.

This property is, above all things, stunning and highly welcoming, with the service and facilities of a top-notch hotel plus the exclusivity of a private home. The team has a genuine love for the service and a passion for the task of running a world class property, so all in all, The Legian Bali is a very special, ‘one off’ sort of a place.

We stayed at a 2-BR-suite together with our 4 year old and 6 year old daughter.
The kids had a blast. For the first time in years, we didn't bring our nanny from Singapore and chose to use one of the in-house nannies, called Made. This lady was amazing. The girls fell in love with her the moment they saw her.

A big bravo also goes to Mr. Dorin Schuster, the Executive Chef at the Hotel. The quality of the food served throughout the day, may it be the breakfast, snacks for the children, afternoon tea, snacks at the bar or dinner menu at the restaurant were just amazing. The quality, freshness and attention to detail are worth 5 Michein Stars!

I would like to congratulate the General Manager, Mr. Kevin Abramowicz on his team. From the driver who welcomed us at the airport to the room service, pool boys, safety guards at the beach, service staff at the spa, yoga teacher etc. one can feel, that every single employee has a great respect for the hotel, the guests and a very personal connection to The Legian.

We regret not having visited the hotel during our other trips to Bali, are grateful to our friends who introduced us to the hotel and can't wait to go back there very soon.

Thank you for an amazing family holiday.

Looking forward to seeing you soon.

Best regards,
The Kossich Family",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1495,The Club at The Legian Bali - sensational,50,September 2013,"Just spent a week at The Club @ The Legian, Bali and did something we've never done before, booked our return visit while still there. It's that good. From the second we were whisked away by a member of staff upon our arrival at the airport until we were waved off by several members of staff, we felt truly on vacation. The Club is situation across the street from the main Legian hotel but it's very easy to use the facilities there and a golf buggy is always available to take you. Our villa (no. 11) was lovely, so much so we barely ventured out as we had the sun for most of the day. The food was incredible both at The Club and at the main restaurant, and we often chose to dine in our villa as the choice of dishes was so good. I can't commend the staff, especially our lovely butler Merta, enough. They couldn't have been more accommodating, always on hand to offer suggestions of places to visit or where to go to buy certain things. Overall, this hotel is ideally located to be able to explore Seminyak and be able to retreat to utter privacy and quiet when you want to. We can't wait for our return visit in December, and I'm positive it won't be the last.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1496,Still one of my favorite hotels in the world,50,September 2013,"It was my 18th stay at The Legian over a period of quite a few years and this most recent stay reminded me again why this is one of my favorite hotels in the world: a great location, amazing views, a wonderful rooms product and just generally incredibly relaxing and wonderful.
I stayed in a two bedroom suite for two nights. The room had been subtly renovated/refreshed since my last visit, but not lost any of the character that I have grown to love. Sweeping views over the pool and beach, the fantastic bathroom (lighting could be a bit better) and excellent food & beverage offering both in the bar and restaurant. The service was pleasant, pretty efficient and the staff were friendly and welcoming throughout the resort.
A memorable stay yet again and I very much look forward to my next visit. I just hope that Bali's traffic situation does not get worse. It felt pretty congested everywhere. Quite a change from when I started visiting this magical island more than 20 years ago now.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1497,A truly wonderful hotel,50,August 2013,"We stayed here at the end of August 2013 with our two children (19 and 21) and right from the start, the staff couldn't have been more attentive and helpful. The rooms are lovely (maybe a little dark - but that's true of most hotels) and the beds wonderfully comfortable. The location is right on the beach and there are plenty of sun loungers and day beds all around the pools and the beach side. We had a lovely yoga session on the grass overlooking the ocean. The food was great - especially the breakfasts and we also recommend the sea food BBQ which was delicious. The staff were really helpful at suggesting and organising restaurants and excursions. We've stayed in lots of top class hotels and this one really is outstanding -we will definitely come again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1498,"Great hotel, great experience",40,September 2013,"My wife and I stayed for one night on the 10th September and returned on the 18th September for lunch.
The Legian is a fabulous property with very attentive staff and we loved the openness of the design with seas breezes blowing through the downstairs public areas. Our room was a little tired and quite dark but the bed was very comfortable.
The only area open for any criticism is the food. Bali is really trying hard to improve its restaurant offer to the more experienced traveler and we had some fabulous food on the island. Sadly this was not the case in the Legian. I found the food to be 'lazy' in its design for example: Fish and Chips in the beautiful sea front restaurant with a wonderful salty sea breeze blowing across you sounds like a dream come true for a chef. But frozen chips and battered fish that was soggy and still had the skin on and no mushy peas? I understand that this is a western dish cooked by Asian staff but if they can't do then don't do it. Frozen thin McDonald style chips is not the Legian!
All in all that did not spoil our enjoyment of this great hotel and I would highly recommend it but eat out.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1499,"The Legian "" In A League Of It's Own""",50,September 2013,"We stayed for 6 nights earlier this month as part of a 3 stop tour of Bali & Lombok.
On reading other reviews much is covered of this amazing hotel. I just want to cover some special touches that help make it such a fabulous hotel.
From the moment you arrive at the airport you know you are going to be staying at a special hotel.
After a long tiring flight from the UK we were greeted by a representative from the hotel. He met us as we got off the plane & dealt with passports & visa's for us , collected luggage & swiftly bypassed the queues securing us in a lovely air conditioned car. It really was a lovely touch not having to deal with visa's etc.
On arriving at hotel we were personally met by hotel manager. On reading other reviews this looks to be a standard of the hotel. This is again a lovely touch that helps make you feel that bit special.
The management clearly have an excellent way of training their staff as they were all so charming & helpful . They had this very clever way with ear pieces of connecting to one another giving them the ability of discretely asking your room no. Repeating the no and then via ear piece would be given your name. They then made sure they used it. Again a lovely way to make you feel special.
The room/suite. Well other reviewers have covered so much about the suite's. But wow wow wow. Absolutely stunning & huge. Really loved the layout decor & furnishings. Bed was super comfy and loved the little notes left on your bed each evening.
What I loved most though was the huge balcony with day bed Beautiful views out across the ocean loved to sit there watching the sunset. What I loved most of all though was sitting on the balcony looking out to sea having our breakfast We did this everyday and it made the perfect start to the day. With no extra charge this was again a lovely touch provided by the hotel
I really could go on and on about all the good things about this hotel. Please if you are wondering which hotel to book in Seminyak, stop wondering & book The Legian. Yes not cheap but worth every penny.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1500,"Great location, service and big rooms with a view of the beach",50,September 2013,"After a 7 year hiatus I stayed at the Legian again recently. I only wish I hadn't left it so long to return. The staff are all friendly and efficient, rooms are spacious with the most wonderful view over the spectacular pool and beach. We ( 3 adults) stayed in a Club 2 bedroom suite which has more than enough room both inside and out on the huge balcony. Service throughout our stay was very good, from arrival to departure.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1501,Better than ever,50,September 2013,"We have just returned from our 6th stay at the Legian and the place just gets better and better each time we return. The recent refurbishment has freshened up most things but the design has remained the same, which I like as it has a Balinese flair. Too many hotels are too generic.

The gym has been completely redone and brand new high-end Technogym equipment was delivered during our stay. The new gym looks fantastic and it makes the daily workout really enjoyable. The Spa offers some excellent treatments.

The new management team is highly competent with a great eye for detail. They have done a lot of fine-tuning and the Legian is now better than ever. The service is top-notch and we really felt pampered by the excellent staff; many have worked there for years and recognise us as returning guests.

Each day we had some delicious food for lunch and the kitchen gladly caters to special wishes. The beef tartare is really yummy.

The Legian is definitely a wonderful hotel and we have already bought tickets to return next year.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1502,Paradise,50,September 2013,"The only problem with writing a review about ""The Legian"" is trying to book back in when it has become well known as the most amazing, wonderful place in Bali that it is. There is simply nothing else like this hotel.

My family of four just had another 9 days in ""paradise""...thank you Kevin and your fabulous team.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1503,Outstanding Service and Quality,50,August 2013,"This is our second stay at the Legian, Bali. The first being 10 years prior. On this trip we had spent 6 weeks away travelling throughout Asia and parts of Europe. Our most impressive memory of quality of service and outstanding attention to detail was at the Legian, Bali. We have been fortunate to experience 5 * service and hotels with our business over many years but the Legian far exceeds the standards of any hotel we have ever stayed at bar none! It is obvious that the thing that drives this high level of attention to detail and customer interaction is the General Manager, Kevin. We found every member of his staff that we interacted with was always quietly doing that little bit more to ensure our stay was memorable. This level of service begins with Kevins personal warm welcome at check-in. It is the only hotel we have ever been in where you see the General Manager actively engaging and interacting with genuine interest with his guests as if you were in a small boutique hotel.

The beauty of the Legian is that you don't have to go anywhere. The rooms, food, grounds, outlook and the amenities are all first class.

We have already begun plans for our next visit at this beautiful hotel before the year is out.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1504,Gorgeous Hotel,50,September 2013,"Stayed at The Legian several times over the years and loved every minute of it.
The manager always greets me upon arrival, and many of the staff welcome me ""home""!!The staff that don't know me are soon greeting me by name every corner I walk around.
Sitting having breakfast or lunch looking at the ocean is beautiful and the food is also devine.
Not a cheap hotel to stay in, but you get what you pay for.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1505,Superb surroundings right on the beach.,50,September 2013,"We stayed 6 days at The Legian last week and were very impressed with the resort. The staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble for any of them. Our one bedroom suite was large, very comfortable and relaxing as was our balcony overlooking the beach with a huge daybed. It was our first visit to Bali and we loved the time we spent at the resort. The horizon pools were beautiful. Fruit and chocolates were left in our suite every day and we enjoyed complimentary afternoon tea each day. We would love to return again. The Ancient Balinese massage was wonderful at the spa.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1506,Absolutely perfect,50,September 2013,"My wife and I stayed at the legian for 8 days of our honeymoon and we wished we had stayed longer. This place isn't just 5 star, it is so much more than that. The hotel itself is stunning, with a great pool area, wonderful sea views and gorgeous rooms.
The food is excellent, we had 3 evening meals all of which were perfect, the seafood indulgence on the Friday was the best seafood I've ever eaten.
Above all of this however, are the staff. They are without a doubt the greatest group of staff I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. From the manager down they are polite, friendly, courteous, smiling, fun and above all lovely people. We did not want to leave and have already promised ourselves a return to the legian. Thank you for giving us the perfect honeymoon.
Jon and gem",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1507,Definitely the loveliest place to stay for a relaxing holiday,50,September 2013,"We're just about to check out from another fantastic stay at The Legian Bali. Our stay was for seven nights. Our room and service were fantastic. The facilities, location, aspect and service are one of the main reasons we keep coming back. The other reason is how relaxed we are after a stay here. We generally only stay a week at a time, rushing to start our holiday right from work, then after a week's holiday, departing to be home for the weekend to get ready for the work week ahead. After a stay at The Legian we are refreshed, recharged and ready to head back into our working lives after being pampered and well cared for. Thank you everyone at The Legian Bali for another fantastic holiday. We'll probably need another visit in six or so months' time. We prefer to stay in the hotel, although the villa complex is beautiful, and very peaceful. We like the hotel's proximity to the beautiful beach, and we love the sound of the ocean. The newly renovated gym is pretty outstanding, with lots of new equipment, more than adequate for a strength and cardio workout. I haven't used the spa, but I'm sure this facility/service is as outstanding as every other facility/service at The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1508,"Outstanding hotel, especially the service!",50,September 2013,"My wife and I stayed here for the second week of our honeymoon and we couldn't have been more pleased (the first week was at the Samaya Ubud which was also amazing).

First and most importantly, the staff were super friendly, greeting you by name and asking what your plans are and if there is anything they can do for you. They are there for every need, but not in an intrusive manner. A prime example being poolside, when you walk to the pool you grab a sun lounger and they will fetch you towels, iced water, along with frequent snacks such as orange sorbets. The concierge service was also excellent, they arranged our restaurant bookings and excursions with precision and promptness; as a side note they have a book of suggested restaurants which were all great and a large variety of excursions.

For any honeymooners I could not recommend this place more, upon arrival we were shown around the beautiful hotel with some refreshing lemon grass drinks, and upgraded to a deluxed suite, which was pretty massive and impressive. We had a bottle of champagne and cake with happy honeymoon written on it waiting for us in the room, along with a bath full of flowers. We were also given a complementary couples massage in the spa, which was superb.

The hotel grounds itself was a place of beauty. I read a lot of reviews before picking our honeymoon destination since its a special holiday and the Legian got a lot of praise, and I can see that it is more than justified. The hotel has a great spot on the very long beach that stretches along the west coast of bali. The waves in the sea are very strong! But we enjoyed it as it was much more different than the seas we have been in, definately not for relaxing. For that there are the 3 infinity pools, which surprisingly are quiet and relaxing even for the size of the hotel. The grounds are all well kept and pretty.

We also enjoyed quite a lot of food and cocktails at the hotel, which was all top notch. Standing out for me was the 'seafood indulgence' that they hold on Fridays, where they have a seafood buffet next to the beach where they have a variety of seafood such as crayfish and sushi, along with fish you can order cooked how you like right in front of you on the beach.

So if you are looking at the hotel and wondering if you should go for it, I would say yes! Especially for special occasions such as a honeymoon. The hotel will make you feel like royalty :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1509,Wonderfull stay,50,August 2013,"Traveling around the world for the last 20yrs, found one of the better places to spend an unique holiday, from allocation, spacious suite rooms, situation beach front, great quality and variety of food and staff service a real 5 star experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1510,Perfect Combination!,50,August 2013,"What a nice hotel! I traveled many places and lots of good hotels but I would put this Legian Bali hotel one of the best hotels that I and my wife have ever stayed.

I tried to find a room with a beach view so I contacted the hotel and they recommended me to take a 'one bed room deluxe suite' which I eventually did.

Over the course of booking, arrival, staying and departure, hotel staffs were very much kind and helpful. Room that we stayed was bettern than we expected. Hotel was quiet and isolated from urban noise. Also you can just go to the beach directly from the hotel through restaurant and swimming pool. Hotel is literally located on the beach...

One thing that I asked the hotel to improve is quality of tap water. The water feels a bit like 'hard water' so it takes more time to wash our soap or foams when you wash. Not a big thing though.

My wife and I really enjoyed staying at this hotel and this hotel make us want to visit again and we will do so.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1511,Just Wonderful!,50,August 2013,"The Legian is wonderful. The service is amazing. When we arrived, we received not only fruit, but also beautiful chocolates and hors d'oeurves. The room itself was very spacious with separate sleeping and ""living room"" areas. The television swiveled so one could see from either area (although we never turned it on). We had two different balcony areas overlooking the sea. I loved the idea that the toilet and shower are in separately enclosed areas and that there are double sinks-- made getting ready in the morning so easy.
The food is also quite good. The breakfast menu had huge selections: main course served from menu selection; the rest was buffet. We also had dinner which was quite good.
The public areas are lovely. When we leaving the manager as well as other staff came to make sure out stay had been satisfactory and to ask if we had any suggestions to make it better.
All in all, an excellent choice.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1512,Perfect Legian Seminyak,50,August 2013,"We came from Bali,on 19th August (2013).We went already twice( August 2008 and 2009) and we stayed at Samaya(almost next door).We didn't manage rooms this year and tried the Legian,and we must say that the service is much better at Legian.
we stayed in a two bedrooms suite(with our daughters-26 and 18 years old) and it was perfect.
The hotel is beautiful,treatment is perfect,and overall the food at lunch was so fast,we didn't had to wait for long .
We were so happy .The pool is beautiful and so clean.There was many children,but i don't know how they manage,but we didn't heard them .The children were accompanied with maids and we didn't notice any noise. The manager was all day long there,watching everything.We were impressed.We hope return soon.We love Bali and The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1513,Our oasis in Bali,50,August 2013,"Returned to the Legian after 8 days in Lombok. We were looking forward to our return to the Legian and we were not disappointed. We were welcomed in the tranquil lobby by the manager and told we had been upgraded to a lovely, light, corner room. We arrived later than planned and the requested delay in our dinner reservation was not a problem.

The good:
- Great food
- Amazingly well trained staff
- Greeted by name everywhere you go
- Lovely three tiered pool
- Perfect location in Seminyak, bracketed by Ku De Ta and Potato Head
- Generally relaxed, welcoming
- Recommend the java sea wave massage at the spa

The bad:
- Attracts some pretentious guests who believe the world revolves around them at the cost of other guests.

We look forward to our next visit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1514,The Legian lives up to its reputation - and exceeds it,50,August 2013,"We spent a too-brief time at the Legian right at the end of August. From the moment of arrival, when we were greeted by Kevin, the GM, to the sad moment of departure, we were treated with the greatest of care and attention by everyone. To be greeted by name by all the wait staff in the restaurants and around the pools is very impressive. This little touch makes one feel very special and pampered. Check-in was prompt, easy and pleasant, as was checkout. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the Legian...

We had a studio suite on the ground floor facing the beach, with its own little verandah as well as another spot with two sunbeds. This direct access to the lawn, the pools and the beach makes these rooms very well worth the money. There's no need to go through any of the more public areas to get to the water, and this makes for a genuine sense of privacy.

The room was spacious, impeccably clean and quite luxurious. The bathroom was gorgeous and enormous and the bed was very comfortable. My only (tiny) quibble is that there weren't any bedside tables and so one must put the glass of water, the Kindle and the reading glasses on the floor before sleeping - no big deal, just a very minor thing.

We ate tapas in the Pool Bar the first night, and the food was delicious. On the second night the GM hosted a cocktails and canapes evening by the pool, and we had a splendid time. On the Friday, it was my partner's birthday and in what is turning out to be something of a tradition in hotels when we travel in August, we were greeted at breakfast with glasses of champagne, a beautiful little spongecake with a candle, and the staff singing 'Happy birthday'. It's going to be so hard to spend birthdays at home from now on!!! This is such a lovely thoughtful gesture on the part of hotel management, and I'm sure always appreciated.

We had decided to do almost nothing during our brief stay, except a little burst of shopping, and so we spent many hours on sunbeds, watching the rather fierce surf pounding into the beach and intrepid tourists dealing with big unruly waves. We were plied with beers and snacks by an assiduous group of wait staff, who were all charming, helpful and quick!

On our last night (getting ready for the brutal 1.00 am flight from Denpasar to Adelaide), we ate at the hotel restaurant, and we were agreeably surprised by the prices, given that this is a 5 star hotel. Our meal was delicious and served poolside, with braziers illuminating the three infinity pools, with the surf breaking just beyond. Truly a magical and delightful experience!
This is a seriously lovely hotel, with outstanding management and staff, and they all rightly deserve the positive reviews seen here on TA. I wish I could award 6 stars! I will recommend this hotel without reservation, and hope to return one day.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1515,Perfect beach holiday stop in Bali,50,September 2012,"I stayed at the Legian Bali with my parents, brother and girlfriend. After being unhappy with another 5* hotel, we decided to move to the Legian, they were absolutely great to accommodate us at short notice. The welcome at the hotel was very warm and the receptionists were very professional and speedy with the checkin. Waiting in the lobby we had our welcome drink and we really liked the big photography on the walls (thinking of buying one of the portraits from the artist).

The rooms were extremely clean and spacious. The beds were very comfortable, I had great night sleep in the bed even though I was in pain after having broken my foot a couple days before.

The gym is a good size with a couple of running machines (I don’t understand people going for runs inside when you have the amazing beach at your doorstep), a selection of free weights and machines & finally a sauna.

The most amazing feature of the hotel is its location and beachfront sunbeds/pools. The beach and sea right in front of the Legian is to die for. Anybody who enjoys a good wave can take some of the hotels bodyboards and venture into the sea, or just swim in one of the pools and enjoy the breathtaking views from the pool. The hotel is far enough away from Kuta, so its less crowded and you can thoroughly relax. But if you want to go for a walk on the beach, you can go for mils until you get to Kuta.

The only negative point for the hotel is that there is a lack variety for dinner at the hotel and prices are expensive. The food quality is great and service is very professional, but a lot of guests opt to dine in the town outside of the hotel, the concierge is happy to give some recommendations. The special barbecue by the beach where the food is served as a buffet was a good option as well.

Overall I can not rate the Legian high enough, it is one of my favorite hotels I stayed at and would recommend it to anybody visiting Bali. One of my favourite memories from my trip is to wake up after a good night sleep and get the great breakfast while enjoying the view of the sea....",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1516,Unforgettable Wedding Anniversary Experience,50,June 2013,"From the moment of arrival, we were given an excellent service. All we had to do was hand in our ID and credit card and they took care of the rest while we enjoyed the welcome drink and the beautiful lobby. I am not sure whether it was because we paid debit, but we got our room upgraded from Studio to Deluxe room with two bedrooms - which we didnt even need! It was a huge, spacious room complete with its own pantry, dining room, beautiful bathroom and amazing beach-facing balcony. The bed was super comfortable - our only minor irritation was the smell of the linen which was rather damp. Other than that, it was great.

The service of the waiters was impeccable - everyone was friendly and attentive and they made us feel very comfortable but non-intrusive. We arrived on Friday and there was a Friday barbecue by the beach - which was highly recommended. You get to eat outdoor by the beach and the food is served buffet style. Try everything - seriously, the food is just out of this world!

The Pool boys did excellent jobs catering everything we needed - from magazines, cold drinks to adjusting the towels to make us feel more comfortable.

Facilities are excellent - the restaurant served really delicious food - kudos to the chef and his staff - the pool was special because it was three-tiered from the shallowest for children to the deepest (1.8 m) for adults.

The hotel was having some renovation works during our stay, and it looked a bit different from the website. It should be updated to reflect what the rooms look like now.

Extra personal touch was shown as an effort by the management, through welcome letter, which we appreciated. At the end of our stay, the manager also had a small chat with us and ask about our stay and when we would return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1517,Reservation and booking process,20,August 2013,"I need to share my disappointment with the reservation and booking process for this hotel. Firstly unlike 90% of the hotels in the immediate area they refused to quote my room rate in Australian dollars only US dollars. Secondly they did not devulge the taxes when quoting the room rate. Thirdly it was only a matter of 2 hours approximately that my circumstances changed and I notified reservations immediately to change my booking from a 2 person room to a 3 person room. This more than doubled my original room rate, it in actual fact made the whole stay out of our reach price wise. The original room amount had already been taken from my credit card and reservations would not accept my upgrade until I paid the balance now outstanding in full. Once I complained they reduced the additional person room rate by $ 20 per night and have agreed for me to pay the balance on arrival which is very generous, but unfortunately even with these concessions it still becomes a very expensive stay at this hotel. I have asked for a full refund so we can stay at another cheaper hotel, and the hotel have refused to return my money stating their no cancellation policy, which again I have search a number of hotels in the area and they do not have such a policy. PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN BOOKING THIS HOTEL!!! They seem to be inflexible with their bookings, I wonder what their service will be like now I have been forced into staying there.........",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1518,Amazing experience... amazing hotel!,50,July 2013,"Met up with my family who had been travelling around Europe in Bali for a weeks getaway from Adelaide and were staying in Seminyak at the Legian Hotel on the beach front.

The hotel is incredible... we were staying in a two bedroom suite, and I was amazed by the size of the room in its entirety, especially the main bathroom and open living area. The rooms had everything we could have wanted, bottled water available (as tap water in bali is not drinkable) and a free minibar, replenished twice daily. The housekeeping staff are impeccable, and the evening turn down service with evening snacks... a lovely added touch.

The Pools are incredible, and the lounges overlooking the pools and the beach are great for relaxing. The restaurant, whilst pricy, is worth every cent, and the service is incredible, especially at breakfast time.

The staff are amazing, so friendly and polite, and do anything they can to make your stay spectacular... even little things like saying hello and smiling when you pass them in various areas of the hotel.

Highly recommend for anyone travelling to Bali and wanting to stay in Seminyak, away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Nusa Dua.
The only downside of the hotel is now, when I stay at another hotel elsewhere in the world, nothing will compare, the service and attention to detail of the Legian was so incredible, I fear I will not find anything like it again!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1519,good service hotel with direct beach access,40,August 2013,"Our two bed roon suite is not available during check in and we are upgraded to a 3 bedroom beach house and a free lunch as apology . so I do appreciate their service and the manager , Kelvin 's hospitality . the beach house is excellent with direct access to the beach and private pool but beware of the mosquito around you.During our stay , the seminyak beach is too wavery to swim and its a big pity as we cant swim in the sea . I have tried both lunch and dinner in the hotel which has good western food .the hotel takes 10 min walking to the main seminyak square which is the closest shoppingrea . perhaps next time , I may try the hotel near the bali bay with better calm beach or the ubud area with more feature shopping . another thing to mention is the jamaran bay seafood is too pricey to try and the quality is not worth the price though the taste is not bad.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1520,Cannot rate The Legian highly enough,50,July 2013,"We stayed here for six nights on the recommendation of two sets of friends (one couple and one family with 2 small children, so with quite different expectations and perspectives). Their recommendations were spot on. The manager, Kevin Abramowicz, is running a seriously high level operation in every respect and is to be congratulated for the standards he has set and is maintaining at The Legian.

The Legian is big enough to ensure that it doesn't feel as though you are staying at an empty hotel, but not so large enough that it becomes overwhelming in terms of size and number of people. The feeling is relaxing and not overly formal - the vibe is a gentle energy which we felt was perfect.

The rooms are huge and well-appointed, with understated Balinese decoration (we had a deluxe suite, which had a separate dining and lounge area and guest powder room, and could be completely closed off from the master bedroom and master bathroom). The grounds are well-maintained and the three pools brilliant. All the staff offer the highest level of kind and smiling but unobtrusive service. The breakfast is a real highlight!

There is a spa (the treatments we had were very high quality) and small but well-equipped gym.

There are less costly accommodation options in Bali, but when all of the benefits of The Legian are added up, we thought it was great value for money. We are already looking forward to when we can next return to The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1521,Simply The Best!,50,July 2013,"We decided upon The Legian after researching hotels on the internet and noticed the positive feed back on Trip Advisor. We struck gold. This is a seriously good hotel from every angle. Our trip to Bali was to a degree an after thought. We were on the way home from Paris and took the opportunity to break the trip and check Bali out as a potential future destination. We loved everything this hotel experience offered. Being in Seminyak it is far enough away from Kuta which was an area they we wished to avoid.The position on the beach is superb and provides a real oasis. The infinity pool and loungers elevated and overlooking the beach is the ultimate spot to relax and watch the world go by. The security at the beach entrance and front of the hotel is discreet and reassuring. We had a studio suite on the third floor overlooking the pool and ocean. This is one of the cheapest rooms in the hotel but it was incredibly generous and very impressive. The ambience and décor is stunningly beautiful. The staff are delightful, very attentive and polite. We only had four nights at the hotel and ate out at three restaurants that were highly recommended to us namely, Sarong, Sardine and Mamasan. Each of these restaurants were impressive. We decided to dine at the hotel the last night of our stay and were seated on the patio beside the pool. We selected the Chefs Menu which proved to be outstanding. Best Wagu we have ever had. We loved The Legian. Very impressive in all respects. One of the best hotels we have stayed in and we will be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1522,One of the best stays ever in Bali!,50,August 2012,"We have been to Bali a few times and this hotel beat every other stay. Great service, location in Seminyak, and amazing food. The resort itself is phenomenal! We really loved our stay here. Can't go wrong with this hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1523,Best of Seminyak !,50,July 2013,We were totally spoilt with the level of service and food at this amazing hotel... We were a group of 38 guests.

1524,Excellent for kids and families and probably anyone,50,July 2013,"After making a terrible decision to book a 'Bali Villa' recommended by friends (we prepaid 10 nights, left after one) - I checked my family (wife, 5 and 8 year old kids) into a two bedroom suite at the Legian. Incredibly large room, master bathroom even larger than the King bedroom. Hotel is very, very good with excellent service. We travel a reasonable amount and I am quite fussy. Legian is a very good hotel, much better than I expected we would find in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1525,Absolutely Relaxing,50,July 2013,"Stayed at the Legian with a large family of 38 for 5 nights and the entire experience was wonderful. They have nice beach and a great pool. the concierge helped us out find great places to eat as it is not easy to get reservations for large group.

I must say that their breakfast spread is outstanding and so is the quality of their food.

Will definitely visit again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1526,Totally spoilt!,50,June 2013,"From the second we arrived to our departure and escort to the airport customs desk, it was total luxuary!
Everything was at our finger tips, and anythig extra was never an issue.
Tod lost his phone and for 2 days the Staff did everthing thay could think of including going back over video footage to see what cab we used to get home, calling the cab driver and thus returning Tods phone!
Couldnt be happier, will be staying here again!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1527,Absolutely wonderful!,50,June 2013,"My husband and I stayed at The Legian for 9 nights on the last leg of our honeymoon. And I am so glad that we saved the best till last! The Legian is absolutely fantastic - we honestly couldn't fault a thing.

We chose to stay in a one bedroom villa over at The Club which is just across the road from the main hotel. The villa itself was awesome - spacious, all mod-cons (including Bose sound system) with an outdoor 10m pool. We were also impressed with the extras you get as a Club guest - complimentary mini bar (alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks), snacks, unlimited laundry, daily newspaper, iPad, fully loaded iPods, chauffeur around Seminyak and of course, a personal butler. Out butler was Yoni who did a fantastic job of looking after us. She made our restaurant reservations, recommended things to do and generally made us feel like VIPs. Nothing was too much trouble and even the smallest details were taken care of (my husband mentioned that he liked passionfruits and we had fresh passionfruits left in our villa every morning). In fact all of the staff both at The Club and the main hotel were excellent and we received top class service wherever we went.

We didn't spend much time at the main hotel but the pool area (which overlooks the ocean) looked lovely. We ate dinner in the main restaurant on two occasions and both meals were very nice. It was fairly pricey (especially the wine) but you are dining in a 5* establishment so you do expect the price tag to match.

The Legian is situated in a central location and you can easily walk to lots of shops, bars and restaurants including Seminyak Square and Ke de Ta. Plus Jimboran Bay is a 45 minute drive away if you fancy a change of scenery (Yoni kindly arranged for us to have dinner there one night).

All in all, The Legian is a class act and probably the best place that we have stayed, in terms of accommodation and service. If you are considering booking then I would say go for it - you won't regret it!

Thank you for a wonderful stay and we hope to come back one day.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1528,A perfect Bali Vacations,50,July 2013,"- Perfect
- Excellent and complete value for money
- Everything about the place is par excellence
- The suites are so comfortable and the service is exceptional
- The airport VIP Visa on arrival, Pick-up and drop service is complete value for money and I would recommend to opt for it
- The place is highly recommended",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1529,Just book it,50,July 2013,"We spent 9 nights at the Legian and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were there during school holidays so the adults pool was a real bonus and very pleastantly enforced by the pool staff. I concur with all the previous excellent reviews. The staff are very professional and do their job exceptionally well, making your stay easy and relaxing. The Concierge staff are amazing and go out of their way to help you make bookings for dinner, tours and spa treatments. Their restaurant recommendations were spot on and nothing was too much trouble.

The breakfast is excellent, best crossiants ever!! but the bacon is very tough (our only complaint about a fabulous breakfast experience). The buffet combined with al a carte options is a very relaxing way to do breakfast, it is nice not to have to jump up and down throughout the meal and have your food freshly cooked. The french toast is amazing and not to be missed, it is worth every kilojoule!!

The newly refurbished spa and gym is excellent. The spa is expensive by Bali standards but you get what you pay for and if you are looking for pampering this is the place to go. The gym has all the usual equipment and staff on hand to give expert advice.

The rooms are excellent we had a two bedroom suite and it was very spacious for the four of us. Having decaf coffee for the nespresso coffee machine in the room was a real bonus. It was very nice to get complimentary freshly frothed milk for the coffee in our room, it arrived within 5 mins of us calling room service. The ice for afternoon drinks also arrived within 5 mins of us calling and was often accompanied by complimentary freshly cut limes (whenever we asked). This empitomises the Legian, it is the little extra touches which make your stay so special. It is very disappointing to get home and dial 5 and find no one on the end of the line!!!

The location of the hotel is excellent we used the lane way (opposite northern exit of hotel) to walk to Seminyak Square (200 metres). The laneway has security guards and we felt safe at all times. The beach out the front of the hotel had a strong sweep but nothing worse than what we experience on the Gold Coast.

If you are considering this hotel - just book it. You will not be disappointed.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1530,"Nothing, yet everything has changed!",50,July 2013,"My recent visit to The Legian was my 5th stay, and by far the best. As all reviews say about this hotel, there is nothing really to fault. Location, service, food and rooms are all well above 5 star. The most recent change is the update of the hotel. To first timers, you wouldn't notice anything, but all of the rooms have been cleverly updated, with no noticeable changes to the decor. It has been kept to the beautiful Legain style - upmarket Balinese. All of the fixtures and fittings have been modernised, including the air conditioning. The new GM, Kevin, was very present, but in no way overbearing. He should be very proud of his wonderful hotel. Also, a big thank you to Rohaan, Director of Rooms, who arranged all of our per arrival requests. We are looking forward to our next visit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1531,Still the best.,50,June 2013,"We recently returned from our 8th stay at the Legian. This year was a bonus visit as we usually go every second year. We enjoyed our visit so much in 2012, that this year we decided to do a detour home from Europe to Australia. Again we were not disappointed. The hotel is fabulous. Suites, just so comfortable. The staff are amazing. Within half an hour of arriving, every member of staff knew our name. It makes you immediately feel at home. Breakfast is always my best meal there. The choice of food is fantastic. Can't wait for our next visit. Maybe next year??",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1532,The best!,50,August 2012,"After our 4 night stay in ubud coming to the legian was breathtaking! The beach, service and location are excellent! We spent 6 nights here and would come back again ad again. The staff were second to none.

This place is worth ever penny and delivers even more! The best in the Seminyak region. Hands down!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1533,"World Class Style, Service and Sophistication",50,June 2013,"I've just returned from five days at The Club at The Legian and have to say it was the best hotel experience I have ever had, anywhere in the world. As many have noted, The Club is a short walk or buggy ride from the main Legian resort, lending an air of exclusivity and privacy to the experience. Our villa, number 6, was at the back of the compound and though we were nervous before arriving about noise from surrounding Seminyak, we experienced no issues whatsoever - it was very peaceful. The photos on the website do not do the villas justice - at almost 500 square metres they are genuinely a home from home, equipped with everything you need for a luxurious and relaxing stay. The decor is understated but elegant and chic, with lots of attention to detail in the soft furnishings and amenities. The outdoor space with 10m pool, dining bale, seating areas, pantry, pond and outdoor bath is simply breathtaking. What really makes The Club special however is the service, especially that of your Butler. Ours, Eka, was a consummate professional and in the manner of all great servers, he quickly understood our needs and began to anticipate them before we could. To have someone remember your prefences from minute one and so thoughtfully cater to your needs is a rare experience indeed. More than a Butler however, Eka became a friend thanks to his warmth, humour and kindness, and I have no doubt this is indicative of the rest of The Club staff also. As for the perks, they have been listed previously but I have to say, having a lexus 4x4 on hand to take us to local restaurants is something I could really get used to! A special thanks to the Club Lounge staff who made beautiful cocktails and canapes for us to enjoy every evening, and to the serving staff of the restaurant in the main resort, who were also exceptional. It's extremely hard to find anything to critique but a minor point would be to change the phones in the room to cordless ones (like at The Chedi), to save dashing in from outside when someone calls. This was hardly an issue though and both my partner and I came away from the Club feeling more rested, relaxed and content than we have a long time. A huge thanks again to Eka, the GM Kevin and the entire team for making this the ultimate luxury experience - we look forward to seeing you again next year.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1534,A beautiful hotel,50,June 2013,The best hotel I have ever stayed in. Staff and the services were fantastic. We came to Bali for a short break to just relax and the Legian was perfect for this. The Club pool and yoga classes were great and our suite was luxurious. The hotel itself is a short walk from all of the action on Seminyak Square but it was hard for us to leave the cool and friendly sanctuary of the hotel grounds. Highly recommended.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1535,Just the best place to unwind,50,December 2012,"We stayed here for 7 days in December. It is the best hotel I have ever been to, not just the food and the outlook, but the amazing service from all the staff. It is definitely worth the money. I would recommend it for couples over families. I am very keen to come back soon.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1536,I'm never staying anywhere else in seminyak again!,50,July 2012,"This was my 2nd stay here the first was 9 yrs ago. Not much has changed except a new pool which is a great addition and its still as beautiful as ever.

We had one of the 2 roomed suites on level 2 with balconies overlooking the pool, ocean and the east also. This room came with a butler (Wayan) who catered to every need and request from room cleaning and tidying to booking dinners and outings
The hotel rooms have not been updated since I was last there but still look great and very clean as you expect from a 5+ star hotel.
In the suite included - all soft drinks and fresh fruit as much as you consumed, a welcome gift and bottle of wine on your first night and every night a plate of petite fours. The service is impeccable and nothing is too much trouble.
The Balconies are great to watch the sun rise and sunsets.
The breakfast is still amazing as is the poolside lunches and the dinner in the restaurant is gorgeous in the candle lit by the sea side.
It's not the newest but it certainly is the best at service, has best amenities you never want to leave and the location is perfect as its so close to all the cool seminyak restaurants.
It's ideal for a family with children or 2 couples.

To sum it up it's an amazing property and well worth the extra cash and with 24hr security you know you're always safe.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1537,Amazing hotel!,50,June 2013,"This has to be one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. The property itself was beautiful, and all the services the hotel offered were great. The rooms themselves are outstanding. We had a two bedroom suite that overlooked the pool and the ocean, and it was a pleasure to spend time on the balcony. The pool is amazing, and offers full views of the ocean. The food is also great, all the way through from breakfast to dinner. The staff are all friendly and helpful, and are always nearby to assist in any way. I couldn't say enough good things about this hotel, and I hope I get to stay here again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1538,"Elegant, understated, beautiful.",50,June 2013,"The Legian Bali hotel lives up to its reputation as one of the best hotels in Bali. The decor,the service, the beautiful pool and beach front location is outstanding. We stayed in a garden studio with a view of the gardens and beach beyond. The studios are huge with separate living areas, kichenettes and beautiful bathrooms. Outside you get a sun lounge area and a decked area with table. The complimentary nesspresso, soft drinks and juices are a wonderful touch. The free iPods an added bonus. The welcome and nightly bites such as macaroons are a touch of elegance.

The breakfast is wonderful with chefs preparing eggs, pancakes and waffles to order, good selection of buffs items. Afternoon tea by the pool another bonus.

Staff are uniformly attentive without being intrusive. The full visibility of Kevin the G.M can be credited with instilling a sense of pride in the work the staff deliver. A big thanks to him for the outstanding stay we had.

To note, the gym/spa is currently being renovated so you can take a golf cart across the road to the villa complex where or villa as been temporarily converted to provide gym and spa facilities.

Definitely a class hotel, and one to which we shall return. Highly recommended.

1539,Great hotel. Amazing service. Beautiful smiles from the staff.,50,June 2013,"The hotel is right on the beach, with its own lifesaver, the choice of 3 pools, 2 bars and a great restaurant.
Located in Seminyak it's easy to go out shopping!
The hotel at night looks amazing with all the candles lit.
During the day you can just stay by the beach or by the pool and eat a delicious lunch and have a massage with the sounds of the waves on your long chair.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1540,"Friendly,clean, beautiful and relaxing!",50,June 2013,"All staff very attentive new out names always around if we needed them, very helpful, beautiful grounds and surroundings. The rooms were
gorgeous with little extra gadgets and giants which we loved. Lovely range of food for breakfast lunch and dinner. Amazing cocktails and mocktails. Massages were just what we needed. Location wise bit far from seminyak square where we found some little gems of places. Room service was awesome!

Would definately recommend it to friends and family.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1541,One of my amazing experience,50,June 2013,"I have been staying at The Legian Bali Hotel in a deluxe suite for couples of day about a week ago and I had a great experience for staying there and enjoying the the food for breakfast and dinner there.
I'm not going to talk about the room here as I have no complaint about it at all, the room was comfortably clean, large and beautiful. I'm more like to share about my food experience at the restaurant in the hotel which was mind-blowing.
When I got to my room, they served me with a very yummy welcoming afternoon tea. I had a very delicious eggs benedict and strawberry pancakes for breakfast on the table with the beach front view. Okay, it's just eggs benedict and pancakes, it sounded ordinary. But the eggs benedict was differently amazing than another eggs benedict I've ever had, the strawberry pancakes, too. You guys should try it and feel the different, highly recommended.

Then I had dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and the food was amazingly wonderful!!!
I had 5 degustation with lovely French red wine that night.Well, I will not talk about all the food that I had that night but I would like to share the most favorite yet most delicious one, in my version of course. There's 3 degustation out of 5 I love the most. First, The Tuna Sashimi. Second, The cauliflower couscous topped with fresh prawn with caviar, and the last one was tenderloin steak with foie gras on top.

I had an amazing experience and a beautiful food experience as well for staying there and I would like to do it again more often next time. Thank you The Legian, Keep up the good work!",The Legian Seminyak Bali

1543,Great Hotel & fantastic service,50,June 2013,The Legian lives up to its reputation as one of the best hotel in Bali. I would definitely recommend this hotel highly to anyone. We love the infinity pool by the beach and the close proximity of the hotel to the beach. The room was also beyond our wildest expectations.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1544,Awesome Place To Stay!!!,50,June 2013,"We have just spent a week in a one bedroom villa at The Club, The Legian in Seminyak, Bali. Absolutely wonderful, the staff were amazing (special shout out to Sande our butler and Suta the bar man) both of these wonderful people made our stay that much more welcoming and enjoyable. The hotel itself is across the road and opens onto the ocean. A beautiful setting for either breakfast or dinner. The Club where the villas are located is truly private and peaceful. Would recommend staying at the Villas to anyone!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1545,can't fault it,50,April 2013,"An amazing place to stay.
From the collection at the airport to departure, i couldn't fault anything.
Staff are the friendliest and most helpful i've ever experienced; unlike some other reviewers, i didn't find the staff here too overbearing - maybe they've dialled it down a bit.
Rooms are huge, and the nicest i've stayed in anywhere.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1546,Best service ever experienced!,50,May 2013,"My husband and 19 month old daughter have just returned from a week at the Legian Club. We stayed in a villa at the club, as opposed to the main hotel on the beach. I couldn't not review as it was just outstanding, we travel regularly and I would have to say the service we received was hands down the best I have ever experienced. We had two nights at the W Hotel first, so from the moment the driver from the Legian picked us up is the moment the good service began, everyone is constantly smiling and happy to oblige any request. I have to made a very big special mention to Chandra, our butler - she was amazing. Friendly/ helpful and nothing too much. All our reservations made, a car to take us/ pick us up to where you are wanting to go for dinner or shopping. Your washing is done daily, when you have a little one - this is a huge luxury. Afternoon tea bought to your villa or you can enjoy in the lounge area, cocktail in the lounge from 6-8.

It is walking distance to most things and otherwise you are driven and picked up.

We will def. be returning to this wonderful hotel. Thanks again to all the staff there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1547,Excellent Hotel,50,May 2013,"Can't really add any more than the other rave reviews about this hotel, just wanted to confirm what everyone else is saying - it is a fabulous hotel. My only criticisms - the attention from the staff can be too overbearing. I would suggest that if you don't want to be fawned over continually whilst you're there then let Management know. With hindsight I should have done and my stay would have been more relaxed. I found that Management really do respond to feedback. The place is run like clockwork and the staff are very well trained. Had it not been for this fabulous hotel I would not have enjoyed myself that much as I really didn't like Seminyak, and was disappointed by the beach. But that is entirely subjective and nothing to do with the hotel. It's my fault. I should have done more research and would have found that the beach has huge surf and the sea is very active. I expected stretches of beautiful white sand and a calm, turquoise ocean, akin to parts of Thailand and the Maldives. It certainly isn't!

Thankfully, this hotel is worth it's weight in gold and was a lovely experience.

Perhaps an adult only area would be a nice touch? I could imagine it getting very much like a 'kids club' during busy periods.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1548,Outstanding!,50,May 2013,"Just returned from our first trip to Bali and The Legian, and we cannot praise this hotel enough.... from the moment you drive into the gates you're greeted with a smile and warm welcome from every member of staff..... nothing is too much! they have thought of everything.... refreshments in the heat of the afternoon by the pool, to taking the liberty of making your checkout late to match a departing flight without being asked! The restaurant was fantastic, the cocktails sublime and I only wish other ""so called"" first class hotels would use this place as the benchmark. We only had a studio suite on the ground floor, however..... this was fantastic with direct access to the pool area and ocean and bigger than some suites we have stayed in around the world was plenty big enough as we only used the room to freshen up and sleep, as there's so much to enjoy outside. A little gripe would be the allowance of one guest on two occasions to bring in large groups to take pictures of the pool areas whilst we're trying to relax and at one stage getting out electronic room dimension measuring gadgets whilst we were at dinner one evening..... certainly a little unusual and intimidating!
Other than this - fabulous staff, great food, a superb pool area with the best ""pool concierges"".
Cant wait to go again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1549,coming back,50,May 2013,"Coming back after 7 years; better than ever; even some of the staff still there; It is THE Place to spend the last few days before departure from this beautiful island !

new spa in construction; new third pool finished",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1550,The most amazing place to stay in Bali,50,May 2013,"I would like to start this review by thanking the Manager Kevin and his entire team for making our first holiday in 3 years so amazing. The Legian is without doubt the best hotel we have stayed in. The staff are so friendly and welcoming - right from check-in to when we left with Kevin standing on the steps to say good-bye, the service was perfect. This hotel is not snobbish in any way - it just offers the best in accommodation and service with no pretensions. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a suite which was so stunning and much appreciated. We spent every late afternoon on our daybed on the balcony with a cool drink, overlooking the beach. You can be assured that all rooms have an ocean view and the studio suites are perfect for couples as they still have an enormous living room and balcony. The pools (3 of them) are overlooking the beach and all wet-edged, so there's one that suits families with kids and then the lower one is great for swimming lengths or just lolling around looking at the beach. We walked the beach every day. Ku de Ta is only a short stroll away and Potato Head not that much further in the other direction. Check out both but don't spend too much time there - they are both trendy with loud music and over priced drinks. If you decide to venture out of The Legian then you are not far away from Éat Street' where we enjoyed numerous meals. Our favourite was Ginger Moon. They have the most amazing food and although they call their food share plates, the servings are very generous. I forgot to mention the breakfast. There's no overcooked self-serve buffet. You order your hot food from a great menu and everything is freshly cooked - Eggs Benedict, the best omelettes etc. Just remember when you arrive for breakfast the next day the wait staff will have remembered what your ordered the day before - how great is that. Also, the coffee is great, the pastries are terrific and I could go on.
I reckon you will be like us and not want to leave the resort much at all. The service by the pool is second to none - chilled water always topped up, cool face towels and spray, friendly chat with the wait staff if you want. (They all love working at the Legian and have very interesting family lives to share with you). Don't forget the delicious afternoon tea from 4pm each day.
As far as the room goes, housekeeping is so on the button. Room made up each morning at a time to suit. Turn down service (with delicious treat) each evening also at a time to suit. Beautiful candle lit on your balcony. And, no need to bring the insect repellent and it is all supplied if you need it.
I could go on however, you need to go there yourselves and enjoy every minute.
We will be booking again for next year without a doubt.
Thanks again to The Legian",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1551,Just keeps on getting better,50,May 2013,"we have been coming to this hotel for the last seven years and just when you think it can't get any better, it does. Lots of small improvements in the last 12 months join together to make an even better experience when staying at The Legian. The rooms have been refurbished with lots of small attention to detail while keeping the overall Legian style which has made it the best hotel in Bali. The staff are superior to any other hotel we have stayed at worldwide and every wish is read from the lips and nothing too much trouble. After years of commenting that the sunbeds should be under sun shades this has now happened. They are however a little too small and in too short a number as you need a shade per sunbed to get adequate cover. As a result the staff were permanently having to roll heavy sun shades around as at present only one shade per two sunbeds is provided and most guests found this insufficient shade coverage.
The GM Kevin is very evident on site and obviously runs the ship as tightly as his predecessors.
Two small suggestions :
On the mains steps down to the beach from the hotel there should be a handrail on one side as not only we ( still relatively young ) nearly slipped on these steps. Witnessed several elderly guests having same issue.
Room service appetizer and sunbed menu ( bring back the Samosas)
Very nice to now see a female hotel security guard. Not only optically a nice addition but good to see emancipation has reached Bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1552,Just keeps getting better,50,May 2013,"Cannot think of staying anywhere else. Just the best staff, best service. Best spa treatments, best pools, best position, best food either in house or at many great restaurants nearby.

Have just arrived home to the freezing cold, need to start saving to go back again.

Thanks you everybody just fantastic.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1553,Wonderful - could not fault this divine resort!,50,May 2013,"The Legian was amazing. We stayed there last week for our 10th wedding anniversary (sans children) and we loved it. The service is second to none, the views and pool / beach area are just so beautiful and nothing was ever any trouble for the staff. We only booked a basic room and it was huge and very well appointed with spectacular beach views. The sunset on the day beds at the beach with a pre dinner drink are the perfect way to end a day. A HUGE thank you to all the staff at The Legain for making our (too short) stay so memorable and pleasurable. We are SO glad we stayed at The Legian as we looked at plenty of other options. The best by far!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1554,"Perfect, tranquil stay in the buzz of Seminyak",50,May 2013,"We stayed at the Legian at the end of a 9 day Honeymoon in Bali and what a place to end the trip. The attention to detail in this hotel is amazing, but it still manages to pull off being relaxed and friendly at the same time. This is the place to come if you want to be in the heart of buzzing Seminyak, but want a luxury, peaceful retreat where you can spend the day chilling on the beachfront with cocktail in hand. We had a suite, a huge room with a 4 poster bed and garden terrace, probably a bit overkill, but nonetheless special. We loved our experience here and would definitely go back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1555,Luxurious honeymoon at the Legian,50,May 2013,"This is one of the best, if not the best hotel in Seminyak. Whenever we were in a taxi and asked return to the hotel, the common response would be ""You're staying in THE Legian?!"".

We stayed for 10 nights at the beginning of May and I'm so glad we made The Legian our choice. We were recommended this hotel by my husband's brother who stayed there 2 years ago.

The staff are fantastic; attentive without being obtrusive, all full of personality and smiles, and had an incredible memory for our names no matter where we were in the hotel or who we interacted with!

We were upgraded to a deluxe 1 bed suite. The room was wonderful and about 800 sq ft with a massive bathroom, gorgeous 4 poster bed, dining room and lounge all decorated in Balinese style. Our balcony with a day bed, overlooked the infinity pools and the sea. Every night we fell asleep to the sound of the Indian Ocean waves, which were some of the biggest and craziest i'd ever seen!

The pool area is incredible and where we spent our days. It was very hot, about 35 degs, but the pool staff are on hand to replenish your ice water and cold face towels so it's bearable. The 3 infinity pools are breathtaking and you perch your head on the edge and just watch the waves for hours! Beach is lovely too but was closed off every day for swimming in the sea as the cross tides directly in front of the hotel were mental.

The hotel restaurants and bars are lovely. Good cocktails in the poolside bars (salty dog for me!), and really good lunches there. Breakfast and lunch in the main restaurant really good as well. Great coffee and selection at breakfast and we had the tasting menu at dinner one night overlooking the pools and sea which was awesome. The Friday night seafood BBQ at the hotel is a must! Would definitely recommend that.

The concierge were awesome suggesting loads of restaurants outside of the hotel (recommend Sarong, Sardine, La Lucciola, Metis for formal and Kunis, Chandi and Ginger Moon for informal. Potatohead was cr@p, would only bother going for an hour for a cocktail). They also booked spa treatments at Bodyworks around the corner which is great for a cheaper spa alternative. However when we used our free honeymoon gift of the in-hotel spa treatment, the Legian's own spa was fantastic if a little expensive, but so is everything in the hotel as you would expect.

The hotel was full of couples on a romantic break and young families. There is not much going on in the hotel after 10pm which suited us fine. However if you do want a late night local drink, the Red Carpet Champagne Bar in Seminyak is brilliant!

Can't wait to return next year for my brother in law's wedding, however I'll have to start saving now!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1556,Sad to leave,50,May 2013,"From the moment you walk into the lobby and are greeted from staff with your welcome drink and cold towel , you know your stay is going to be an exceptional one

The staff make this a remarkable property to stay at

In my eyes this is the best in Seminyak",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1557,Excellent,50,May 2013,"We loved this very high end hotel. Not much to say except that our stay was enjoyable on all aspects, they even let us check out very late for no extra. The hotel could be refurbished as it's getting old, but otherwise it was a perfect stay",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1558,Perfect service,40,April 2013,"We have stayed at 'The Legian' many times in the past few years. This experience surpassed previous stays. We stayed for 3 days on our way to Sulawesi. As the hotel was being renovated, we were upgraded to ""The Club at the Legian"". It was lovely, with excellent service in every detail. ""THe Club at the Legian"" is excellent value, as majority of meals and drinks are inclusive of the villa cost. I love the Legian and will return again. The General Manager personally welcomed us and took time with us several times.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1559,The Club at The Legian:Exceptional service and hospitality,50,May 2013,"Having experienced many of Bali's luxury hotels,we decided to revisit Seminyak and try The Legian.We were met by a friendly team at the airport who ensured a comfortable trip to The Club.The Director, Rohaan,personally greeted us at reception and introduced our butler,Toni.The design and architecture is traditional,private and extensive.All the staff were welcoming and courteous and their attention to detail is unique to The Legian.We had our 16yr daughter with us and Toni treated her as a younger sister and extended his sense of family to all of us throughout our stay.We dined both at The Club and at The Legian restaurant and the choice,quality and service was refreshing and alluring on every occasion.Very few hotels are able to sustain a level of quality and hospitality at all levels but The Legian has achieved this.Once immersed in their surroundings you will find yourself in a place of serenity,relaxation and with one of their smiles on your face.Thankyou to GM Kevin and his staff for a memorable holiday in a great location.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1560,Most Wonderful Hotel We've Stayed In,50,April 2013,"We were at the Legian for 6 nights in April after a week in Ubud. We were overwhelmed by the property and it was a great mix of contemporary Balinese style, comfort, and great service. You know you're in Bali, but the resort is legitimately excellent in all aspects. They were even completing some renovations to 1/2 of the hotel - and we saw and heard pretty much nothing.

We were upgraded to a larger suite - which was similar to a hip NYC apartment - it was wonderful. All rooms have ocean views, but some on the ends are a little in the palm trees, so if that matters to you, ask. The hotel staff is amazing and know your name by the 2nd day. The Manager is everywhere - seriously, he is constantly surveying things - and is particularly nice (and relatively new to the property). If you need anything, they'll get it for you. The staff is friendly and extremely attentive.

The common spaces are simple and beautiful. The concierge is diligent and very helpful. Breakfast is somewhat unreal - in terms of quality, selection and that its available through 11am. Lunch/snacks are very good and great variety; dinner is romantic and delicious. We could have taken 1000 pictures to try to capture the beach and property view, but you have to go. Sunset is fantastic over drinks or dinner. We actually went to the Oberoi nearby for dinner, but the food was not as good - and more expensive. [There are a lot of good options off property too.]

The beach is really beautiful - but has somewhat real surf, so know that. We liked it. Great walking beach. The gym/spa at the resort was being renovated, so they would take us on a 1 min golf cart drive to the sister property where they set up a gym and spa - wonderful facilities even for temporary, so no idea what it will be like on site after renovations are done in a short while. Service was attentive, meticulous, but also not too eager to bother you (we've found that annoying at some places); just truly perfect all around.

So much attention to detail for everything; the entire staff even knew it was my husband's birthday - incredible - everyone wished him a great day - by name. Everything is just wonderful. Would go back in a second; one of the most beautiful, fantastic places we've stayed.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1561,Luxury - Worth every cent,50,May 2013,"Amazing service from friendly, professional staff. Stunning pool area right on the beach, and all different day bed and beach chair options to choose from. Just renovated, the new three-tiered pools are gorgeous, whether you want a lap pool, kids pool or just want a refreshing swim in the main pool. In fact, the entire hotel architecture is stunning to look at and the rooms have a unique authentic Asian interior design which results in understated luxury. Every detail of the room, hotel and its management is well thought out. There is no pretentiousness here, just a relaxing nurturing environment for the ultimate holiday. It's a more expensive option of the Seminyak hotels but you will not be disappointed!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1562,Paradise in Bali,50,April 2013,"My Sister and I spent four days here recently in a two bedroom suite, it was absolute heaven. The staff are extraordinary and so lovely. The hotel is so beautiful and the food is exquisite.
I can highly recommend this hotel for couples, honeymooners and families with older children.
Service is the best I have ever experienced anywhere in the world.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1563,Attention to detail,50,April 2013,"My recent stay at The Legian could only be described as ""Perfect"".
From the moment you enter the hotel hidden behind high secure walls you knew that you are in for a great experience. Attention to detail was superb, Many touches made you feel special from being greeted on arrival by the GM in person, thru to the farewell on check out.
Our room was on the 3rd floor overlooking the grounds, the pool and the beach. Attention to detail in the room was impressive, from the bose sound system, the size of the room/bathroom/balcony,kitchenette, entrance foyer, etc, etc.The turndown service also impressive.
The general ambience of the hotel was calm, friendly and professional. A great place for relaxing stay.
A special ""Thank you"" for Kevin and his staff for helping to make my birthday a special day, one to remember.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1564,The Legian,50,April 2013,"Having travelled to many ""leading hotels of the world"" I can safely say the Legian is by far one of the best. We were greeted with a lovely smile and a warm welcome on arrival and were made to feel at home from the outset. We were in Bali to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and the staff at the Legian went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. want stayed in a club villa and a fantastic butler who did everything to make our trip perfect.

The check in process was immaculately smooth and we were greeted warmly by all levels of staff by name throughout the trip, an excellent touch. The general manager, Kevin, arrived to greet us personally in warm and extremely hospitable manner. In no other hotel have we felt the welcoming presence of its senior staff, who definitely give the impression they care about their guests.

We were greeted into our villa with a welcome bottle of sparkling wine and canapés. Having mentioned that I liked passion fruit our villa was stocked up with fresh passion fruit daily. No request was too small for Toni our butler to carry out for us.

The high walls of the club area meant we had a place of peace and solitude from the craziness of seminyak and stepping out was an adventure in itself.

We had both club and main hotel services available to us. We opted to have breakfast at the vibrant beach view restaurant in the main hotel, where the staff took exceptional care of us. Eddie, the food and beverage manager who also introduced himself to us has done an excellent job with the level of service provision at the restaurant. The swimming pools and loung areas on the beach front were very clean and the service was excellent. Highly recommend a massage there! (the spa was closed during our stay but the massages made up for it!)

There were renovations being undertaken at the hotel at the time of our stay but not once did they interfere with our holiday.

We cannot recommend staying at The Legian enough and will definitely return for another visit! Overall our stay at the Legian was faultless!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1565,Great day at the Legian,50,April 2013,"We had stayed at Chedi Club Ubud earlier in the week and since we had such a lovely time there, we wanted to stop by their sister hotel, Legian Bali while we were shopping in seminyak. We stayed for drinks, spa massages, and dinner and had a spectacular time. Between the wonderful staff and the general manager, Mr. Abramowicz, who welcomed us like family, we felt their hospitality was genuine and very kind. The food quality and variety were fantastic and their wine was great (good wine, esp. by the glass, is actually quite hard to find here in Bali). We were particularly fond of their crab over watermelon salad, and their equivalent of pork belly which had an accompanying sauce that could have been the standard balinese dish, but they elevated it with a few more spices making it more complex. The grounds are also beautiful and the plunge pool is right on the beach which is quite nice! We had a couples massage treatment which was quite nice and relaxing and the facilities were beautiful. While I chose Jimbaran thinking it would be more quiet than bustling Seminyak, we realize that this hotel would have been perfect for its close proximity to posh shops and restaurants on J. Laksmana while also being a quiet oasis on the beach that is much more private than I originally beiieved seminyak would be during my trip planning stages. We can't wait to stay here the next time we return to Bali!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1566,Perfection in Seminyak.,50,April 2013,"Where do I start? This hotel is superb in every way. We have stayed in many hotels the world over, but this has to be our favourite. This is our 4th stay in 6 years, and I struggle to absolutely identify why it is so special.
The welcome feels warm and genuine, the studio suite (which we usually book) is huge and classy. They have 2 balconies overlooking the pounding ocean, one with 2 sunbeds. We actually prefer the studio suite to the one bedroom. The pool, especially after the renovation, is perfect. The pool staff provide a tray with iced water all day, continuously refreshing it. There's the little treats of being served during the afternoon with a refreshing fruit stick or sorbet. The provided afternoon tea with sweet treats in either the ocean bar or at the sunbed. The breakfasts are varied and perfect. It's a mix of buffet and a la carte. Fresh juices, smoothies, poached eggs benedict on brioche, eggs any way, fresh waffles with caramelised bananas and maple syrup - the list goes on. We usually don't eat in the hotels that we stay other than breakfast as like to get out to experience the area, but did have dinner last night and it was superb and reasonably priced.
There's the little touches like the frangipani flower on the bed at night, and the sweet treat. There a coffee machine in the room with complimentary capsules, and complimentary soft drinks from the mini-bar.
The beds do tend to be firm, so if you like a softer sleep, ask for the feather top. It made a huge difference to our comfort and because we requested it on booking, was organised prior to check in.
The Legian is our yardstick by which we measure all others, and have yet to find one that even comes close.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1567,Lovely hotel great service,50,January 2013,"Located on Seminyak beach, but private and quiet. Excellent services, staffs are always there to help. King size bed, very comfy. The only downside is its a bit pricey, but worth your money! Overall its a great experience! Highly recommend.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1568,Lovely stay at The Legian,50,April 2013,"Had a wonderful stay at The Legian last week. I hadn't been to Bali before so feel very lucky to have stayed at such a lovely hotel in such a super location - right on the beach and right by the shops! I had had a hard time deciding between the Legian and the Samaya when looking at accommodation and ended up picking The Legian, with no regrets. Whilst it needs a little updating (rooms, pools infrastructure, lighting in the grounds etc and this is underway), the service, the facilities, the relaxed atmosphere and wonderful food totally outweighed the areas where the decor needs to be updated, it was just an impeccably run hotel. We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe room one the ground floor. It was a little dark in the bathroom and as we preferred the doors open and minimal a/c I got a few mozzie bites (in retrospect, I should have asked for a fan) but the room had terrific access to the garden, pool, bar and restaurant. Next time I would try a room on an upper level simply to have more natural light in the bathroom. I would return to The Legian (and to Bali) without hesitation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1569,Perfect Location & Service,50,April 2013,"We have been visiting Bali for 19 years but this was our first stay at this excellent hotel.
Rooms are much larger then the average size rooms found in Bali, as a matter of fact most of the rooms are suites.
Service is close to perfect, staff members are extremely friendly and helpful. The restaurants are excellent and breakfast is superb. But for me the best about this property is the location, a beautiful beach with an infinity pool across 3 levels.
The property is within walking distance of both the KuDeTa and Potato Head, two top beach bars in Seminyak.
Currently one wing is undergoing renovations, this does not impact the stay - as a matter of fact it results in guests having even more space as only about 60% of the hotel rooms are currently used for occupation.
I can only recommend this property and I will for sure go back to the Legian very soon!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1570,Can't imagine a better hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2013,"We spent five nights here in late March with two other couples. All of us could not fault The Legian on any level.
The room was amazing: we had a ground floor room which allowed us direct access across the gardens to the pool and beach. This does mean the balcony is less private, but we found it very convenient for quick trips back to the room etc. The kitchenette in the room features a Nespresso machine for reasonable coffee. All juices and soft drinks are complimentary in the mini bar too. A pleasant surprise! As were the delicious dessert treats that were left in our room during turn-down.

The level of service is outstanding. We ate regularly at the pool bar and enjoyed their seafood bbq night. Excellent food. We ate at the Oberoi hotel for one meal and found their staff to have poorer English and much less attentive service that The Legian. We also attended a wedding at the Anantara Resort and again felt like we had made a sounder choice by staying at The Legian.

The proximity of the pools and sun lounges to the shoreline is outstanding. Pool staff are always ready to provide you with cold towels, face mist and cold water.
We would find it very difficult to return to Seminyak and stay anywhere else. The Legian is worth the $!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1571,Another wonderful stay at the Legian,50,April 2013,"This is our second time staying at the Legian in Bali. They have done some renovation to the suites and pool area, and a bit of renovation is still going on in one wing of suites. It is still an ideal property to stay in Bali. The location is excellent, shopping nearby, great beach area and walking distance to wonderful restaurants. All the rooms are suites or larger, and are spacious and well thought out. There are villas across the street, but we choose a suite overlooking the ocean. The suites have a sitting area, moveable flat screen TV, two balconies and a large modern bathroom. We loved the ipods in each room full of great music and blue ray stocked movies. The snacks each day were a nice touch as was the tea time in the afternoon. We also liked the yoga class in the morning, but would have liked it offered each day. The included breakfast is fresh and tasty, and the food in general is quite good. The staff is attentive and kind, especially the general manager who is accessible and helpful. If you are looking for an enjoyable beach vacation, good for families with teens and couples, the Legian is a great choice.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1572,must be experienced,50,March 2013,"Our stay at the Legian was outstanding in every regard. We have already informed may people we know that this is a resort that ""must be experienced"". The resort more than exceeded our expectations. The staff were all very attentive and friendly. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a deluxe room which was very spacious and has a huge balcony overlooking the ocean. The Restaurant and food in general is worthy of a specific mention. My partner is hard to please when it comes to food but he had the best meal ever at The Legian (the Striploin). We attended other dining 'hot spots' well known in Bali and came away unimpressed saying each time that it wasn't as good as The Legian. I was highly concerned about traveling to Bali as I have a peanut allergy, however, I was reassured by staff at all times that my concerns were taken seriously and the menu would be adjusted according to my needs. The Legian is a resort that takes great pride in meeting the needs and expectations of its visitors. We would like to thank everyone for making our time at The Legian so perfect. We will be back. Tanya and Jason",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1573,Perfect hotel,50,March 2013,"I have never called a hotel stay perfect until stating at The Legian (GMH hotel). Stayed in a deluxe room (suite) with view overlooking the pools and beach. Access directly from the hotel to the sand. The room and facilities were fabulous++. The pool perfect, service excellent and above expectations, breakfast so tasty with great healthy options, best location, - I do not have enough words to describe how beautiful this place is. 6 star rating. Large bedroom and king size bed, large private balcony with very comfortable lounge, very large bathroom with his and her sinks, shower, large bath and toilet, then a separate lounge room and entry hallway with a second toilet next to the front door. If you can afford a holiday of luxury, stay here. Best hotel I have ever stayed at by a long way. There appears to be some refurbishment to one of the accommodation areas, but did not affect my stay at all.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1574,Luxury in Bali with a Generous Smile,50,March 2013,"We would strongly recommend the Legian Bali, it is just one of the best Luxury hotels we have stayed at.  This is our second time to the hotel and we are very glad we returned..  We  really researched the room sizes since we have a 3 year old and we believe it has the largest and most luxurious suites with fantastic views of the ocean.  But what makes this hotel is the staff.  There commitment and attention to every detail.  Always remembering your name, always watching and willing to help.  Always with a smile.  The service at the Hotel is excellent.  The manager Kevin is always very visible, friendly and keeps a watchful eye on everything.  The hotel is very central in Seminyak.  If you want a luxurious, relaxing holiday with great service and a generous smile this hotel cannot be beaten. Finally get them to book and recommend your restaurants since they seem to be able to secure the best seats in the restaurants. Our favourite was Metis Restaurant . We had a great holiday and we are sad to leave. Pat, Agnes & Thomas",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1575,Fabulous Property,50,March 2013,"Having stayed at this property some 10+ years ago, we were delighted to find on our return visit that it had improved with age. The property is a fusion of contemporary and Balinese architecture. It is simply a beautiful hotel with huge suites (separate bedroom, huge double bathroom, separate living and dining areas, a small kitchenette and washroom and enormous balcony with a very comfy day bed and outdoor setting). The thing that really makes this property something special is the staff. All of them were absolutely beautiful - nothing is too much trouble. Everyone is friendly but not familiar and the staff genuinely seem to enjoy working at The Legian - which makes a huge impact on staying guests. No tacky breakfast buffet here - a sophisticated breakfast is on offer every day. Whislt we did dine out regularly, (as there are so many great restaurants around Seminyak these days) other meals and snacks we enjoyed here were fantastic. Afternoon tea is included every day if you feel inclined. I did try a spa treatment which was OK - I'm sure once the new spa and gym is open later this year, it will be fantastic. At the moment, the hotel is undergoing some refurbishment which the management is at pains to try and limit the disruption and noise to guests. The Legian is a class act - we were not disappointed the second time round.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1576,"Great Service, good value and perfect beachfront location.",50,February 2013,"We stayed at one of the suites at the hotel for 2 nights and were highly impressed at this property. We have been to Bali numerous times and stayed at some very nice properties and looking at the reviews, we knew this property is going to be good, but was genuinely impressed since it’s on par with some of the other major properties in Bali which are twice/thrice more expensive than Legian.

When we checked in, the resort manager came out and welcomed and talked for a few minutes which is something you would expect from Aman/Four Seasons property, but Legian does it and that is always a good touch. The hotel itself has only around 80 suites which makes the service personal and I liked that about this property. When you are staying at other resort hotels in Bali (100+ rooms), you do tend to get the feeling that you are one of many guests, but here we felt that the service was personalized and impeccable.

The suite room was of good size with sufficient area for both bedroom and living room area and the balcony was on the big size to sit outside and enjoy the ocean view. The bathroom again was big with his/her side and it is modern, but not over the top modern feel to it. The amenities and the decorations in the room had good Balinese touch to it with arts/paintings.

We tried dinner at the hotel restaurant once and it was great. The seafood selection at the resort is quiet fresh and the overall food quality is excellent. Breakfast at the resort is ok, but not that exceptional. It wasn’t anything bad, but based upon the other food we had at the resort, the breakfast felt bit plain. We tried the food by the pool for lunch and that was excellent. Fresh and great taste.

We spent a lot of time by the pool and it has great view of the ocean/beach and the service at the pool area was excellent. The infinity pool overlooking the ocean is stunning and looks very done/maintained. Special praise goes to the pool area staff who were kind, looking to help and great service overall.

Overall I think for the price you pay, this is a great value property, close to Seminyak, great beachfront location and incredible service. I would rate this property on par with Aman/Four Seasons/St Regis properties in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1577,Another Great Holiday,50,March 2013,"My husband and I have just come back from another wonderful stay at The Legian Bali. Our 22 year old son also stayed in a separate deluxe room and was blown away by the room, the views, and the service. The hotel again exceeded our expectations. The south half of the hotel was closed for renovations, but we were located on the north side of the hotel, and were not disrupted or disturbed by any of the work being undertaken. Again, all of the staff were amazing, extremely friendly, and my husband I thoroughly enjoyed chatting with them during the day. We stayed at the hotel during the Nyepi ceremony period, and I have to say, I am so very glad we stayed at The Legian during this time. Of the half of the Hotel which was available for occupation, only about two thirds of it was occupied, which meant it was extremely peaceful, and our service was exceptional. I also found the hotel's respect for and adherence to an important cultural day, while still providing a beautiful place to relax and eat, fantastic. On Nyepi day, we were required to stay within the hotel grounds from 6am on the 12th March to 6am on the 13th March. The only changes to our services was the removal of the tv cable service on the 12th March (we were still able to watch dvd's) and hardly any lighting on the night of the 12th March. I have to mention, the day before Nyepi day, most shops and restaurants closed from about noon, and they stayed closed until late on the 13th March, so if you are an avid shopper, you might want to book your holiday around this day. My husband and I however, enjoyed being part of this cultural experience, which also involved numerous cultural ceremonies which commenced a couple of days before Nyepi day. We also prefer a relaxing holiday, with time to read, do some exercise, eat very healthy meals, and swim in the beautiful pools under palm trees while the waves crash onto the beach immediately in front of the hotel. My husband and I arrived back in Perth yesterday and we are already looking forward to our next Bali Holiday and staying at The Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1578,As great the second time round!,50,March 2013,"My husband and I had our wedding ceremony and dinner reception at The Legian in 2010 and for obvious reasons, it's been in our top 3 (2 of which are GHM properties), if not FAVOURITE hotel. Even though we've been back to Bali many times since, we never managed to get a reservation until this past weekend, and just like in 2010, this hotel is still by far, the best hotel we've stayed at in Bali.

Admittedly, the hotel is due for an upgrade which they are currently undergoing, but even with the construction (which we were informed would be complete by June/July), service and running of the hotel is absolutely seamless. Everyone from reception team, F&B, the spa (Tin!) and including the pool/beach staff make sure they know your name which is what makes the service feel especially personal. Last time we stayed at The Club so I thought this only came with having a butler!

We stayed in a Studio suite because we wanted a view of the ocean, but even after the one-bedroom Club suite, the Studio suite in no way feels cramped. Plus it was wonderful falling asleep to the sound of the waves! And definitely one of the best things about staying at The Legian is the breakfast -- best sautéed mushrooms ever! We spent a lot of time by the beach and have to say, the new infinity pool is absolutely stunning and a great place to stay cool, work on your tan while enjoying front row seats of the ocean waves.

Thank you to all the team at The Legian for making our return stay as memorable as the first. We will definitely be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1579,a perfect start....,50,January 2013,"We went to bali for our honeymoon and started from THE LEGIAN, SEMINYAK. they upgraded us to a super delux on arrival. The view from the room was fantastic (it was on the top floor). My wife was awestruck by seeing the beauty of the room, and special honeymoon decoration they had done for us.

beach was quite, breakfast was fresh and great variety of food was served. An indian could have many veg options at the hotel. Over all a great experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1580,Service is Impeccable,50,February 2013,"I have now found another hotel that can join my list of the Top 5 hotels in the world for Service. We arrived without luggage, due to Singapore Airlines and immediately the hotel took care of us. Even though we are in the rainy season, we still had some great weather days. We stayed in one of the Club Villas, which was great value for the price. With our own butler, Ary, who was first rate, we were pampered from minute #1.
The Spa has been moved from the main hotel to the Club, which is across the road. This was great for us, but I guess a little inconvenient for the hotel guests. From now to April, they are doing some renovation in the main building, so they have closed off 2 parts of the hotel. However, even though there is work gong on during the day, you can't hear anything when you are at the pool.
The Spa services are great and not too expensive (70 to 100$) for a 90 min treatment.

We will definitely consider returning there. Congrats to Kevin, Rohann, Ary, Shumi and all the team!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1581,A return stay - the service is still excellent,50,January 2013,"Each area in Bali has its distinct character and we definitely like staying in Seminyak when we are in town. Seminyak's appeal lies in its sunset facing beaches and its trendy and fairly upscale town, should you like options outside your resort. However, there are a limited number of hotels to choose from and in particular, limited high-end hotels. There is a new W Hotel there but we don't care for the purple/white/90s decor (and as I understand, its location is not as good) and The Oberoi is getting old, and the rooms smaller (at least when we last did a hotel tour, around 2 years ago). Therefore, we still think that The Legian is the best choice in Seminyak ... for decent rooms and great service. We stayed at The Club Legian last time, which is not beach-side but has large, impressive villas with butler service. This time, we stayed at the less expensive hotel section but found the same great service.

In particular, I like to commend Mr Rohaan Chandra, their Director of Rooms, for his professionalism and excellent service ... we had arrival/airport problems with one of our family members and he was proactive, resourceful and helped find a solution to our problem. He is very pleasant to work with and is certainly someone who would do what he can (within their hotel policies of course) to address guest needs. With leadership like this, you know that the hotel is in good hands.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1582,"WAW , WHAT AN EXPERIENCE",50,February 2013,"An absolutely gorgeous place
This is the best Hotel and restaurant in Bali

The food in the restaurant is magic as usual and always a great experience
The service was exceptional
I will be back very soon
Great job to all in the legian",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1583,The Good Life!,50,February 2013,"The Good Life! Old World Charm, at it’s magnificent finest! Tropical Ocean breezes, off the crashing surf sets the scene for an enjoyable lazy lunch or suburb dinner with uncompromising levels of unobtrusive attentive service and the best food in Bali. Yesterday we had the most enjoyable lunch I can remember: Tuna Tuna Carpaccio with White Truffle Mayonnaise, Rucola Salad, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Parmesan Cheese; Pan–Fried Hokkaido Scallop, Red Onion Confit, Herb Vinaigrette; Cappellini with Freshwater Shrimps, Prawn Oil and Konbu; Wagyu Tenderloin, Périgord Foie Gras, Truffle Jus, complemented with a Shiraz/Grenache from Australian Rolf Binder. Chef Dorin out performs time and time again with simple fresh wholesome dishes.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1584,Top Class,50,November 2012,"We stayed for three nights in a 2 bedroom suite. The room was gorgeous, spacious enough for 2 groups to feel ""together, but separate"" which is what we wanted.

The hotel itself is impeccably maintained, with ultra-accommodating but not overbearing staff. The beachfront setting of the pools, the deck, the bars and the beach itself is faultless.

The breakfast was slightly disappointing, but only because all the other food we enjoyed there was so good.

The location, on the edge of Seminyak is perfect whether you want to walk into town or along the beachfront.

We had a late flight and, having checked out at 2pm were offered the option of freshening up in another room before our airport transfer – a nice touch, that was much appreciated.
Nothing else to say - it is truly excellent.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1585,After the pool renovation--EVEN BETTER!,50,February 2013,"This is our favorite hotel in Seminyak, but things often change so quickly in Bali these days, you just never know if your expectations will continue to be met, year end, year out. Rest assured that The Legian is better than ever and will continue to get better, according to their plans to renovate the already amazing rooms. The service is impeccable; everyone seems to really like their job and that goes a long way to creating a relaxing, enjoyable atmosphere. The spa massages never disappoint, the food is excellent, the beds comfy and rooms spacious. I highly recommend the corner room 131 (which curiously is on the 3rd floor). It has balconies on 2 sides, ocean views, a small kitchenette-- it's as close as you can come to having your own private villa. All in all another amazing experience. Thanks to Kevin and his entire staff for looking after us so magnificently.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1586,Relaxing. Superb,50,February 2013,"We stayed across the road at The Club. Had a 1bedroom villa & butler Purna was superb. Friendly without being too in our face. Customer service started the minute we landed at Denpasar. There's a guide there waiting for us & guided us through the visas & fast track service as we landed late in the evening. He kept us company whilst we waited for our bags. There were many porters about. Then guided us all the way to the driver, complimentary transfer to the hotel.
From the drive to the smooth check-in, whereby Purna met us at the entrance. Our suitcases arrived within minutes of us opening the door to our villa.
Purna's many restaurants recommendation were superb. All drinks & nibbles in the villa bar are free so are laundry. Rides into Seminyak and other places were complimentary. The hotel even picked up our taxi bill when we arrived back at the hotel from an evening out.
Sunsets were amazing. We ate lunches at the pool bar. They really know how to take care of you. Ice water, cool towels, facial mist, complimentary sorbets etc.
We will be back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1587,Unforgettable first time in Bali,50,February 2013,"We stayed in a villa at the club and the secret ingredient that really made the difference was our butler Wydi. He ensured we had four great nights, booked excellent restaurants for us and when we left very early presented us with lunch boxes for the trip home. He found my phone when I forgot it in the gym and tracked us down when my wallet fell out of my pocket on the way to dinner. When we decided to take a few hours in town he arranged for our baby sitter to come in early. Wydi made our stay special but all the staff are great. Nothing was ever any trouble for them at any time. The quality of the hotel is excellent, the food is great, the villa was remarkable and we loved it. Highly recommended!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1588,Just devine...perfect... amazing....stay here!,50,December 2012,"My family and I stayed here early December 2012. Wow,.. the service is amazing..... the breakfasts are just unbelievable....They remember how you have your eggs, how you have your coffee, the fresh beautiful array of fruit for breakfast is just supberb. The pool area is beautiful and the service you get when you sit around the pool is 10 out of 10.. fresh towels, lots of cold icy water....We found this hotel to be just the right size..... not too big and not too small... We were going to stay at the new W located approximately 1km up the road. After we went for a walk there.... I am so glad we chose to stay where we did. This place has a real balinese feel about it. The location is just great, right on the beach and our room had a view out to the office, infact most of the rooms have a view. Room sizes are huge. Our kids just loved the pool too. I would definetely stay here again...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1589,Luxury hotel worth the money paid,50,January 2013,"This is stunning hotel which is kept impecably and is very elegant despite being one of the oldest luxury hotels in Seminyak. The service is amazing and the staff can not do enough to make your stay relaxing. They rememered how I wanted my coffee, my eggs and more. The pool is beatiful and you can't beat the sunset views. The hotel is little and there is only one restuartant but there are so many restuarants around the area of Seminyak you don't need a bigger variety within the hotel grounds. The rooms are beatiful and the gym is excellent. A pity that the SPA prices are ridiculously high. Highly recommend it and I look forward to my next visit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1590,Peace and quiet with style.,50,May 2012,"The excitement of Bali is the busy, bustling lifestyle often in an enervating environment. Once the senses and body are sated, somewhere to relax, be spoilt and re-charge is needed. The Legian, Bali is just such a place with its spacious well appointed suites, beautiful, peaceful gardens and the gentle soothing of the ocean as it softly caresses the beach. You are relaxing nearby with a tall, cool drink.
Sooner than you think possible you are ready for action in the knowledge that The Legian is there waiting to offer solace again. You are in a World of your own.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1591,Great kindness,50,January 2013,"We were staying at the Chedi Club in Ubud but had a late night flight out, so the Chedi arranged for us to spend the afternoon and evening at their sister hotel the Legian. We were not even spending any money there (except for drinks at the pool) and they were so gracious and kind as if we were top paying guests. They even gave us a suite to shower and change in before our flight gratis! While I must say I love the Chedi Club first and foremost, next time I stay in Bali, I will leave at least a few days to stay at this beautiful and expertly run hotel as well! Thank you Legian for your kind hospitality!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1592,Wedding at the legian,40,November 2012,My daughter married here in November.her suite was beautiful and lovely views.they paid great attention to detail.they decided on the Balinese buffet (much too spicy for me) so it is worth considering as I do like some spice in food.the suckling pig was the only thing I could eat.if your wedding is only adult guests then it would be ok.but considering that we had 10 children there there was nothing on the buffet that they could eat apart from suckling pig and wedding cake.i personally found and felt that children are not welcome here which is fair enough as not all adults want holidays or weddings with young children present.but it's worth considering if u have children attending.the hotel is nice and has good reviews.drinks are very expensive bintang was very overpriced.the legian wasn't a place that I would stay at and I visit Bali at least twice a year.i have written this review based on my experience at the wedding with 4 grandchildren.the wedding set up was very good and all looked nice.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1593,Fantastic Experience,50,January 2013,"If you want a beach resort in Bali - this is the place to go. Rooms face the roaring Indian Ocean, fabulous views from a huge, well appointed and very comfortable room.
Staff are great, accommodating and pleasant. Food is very very good with a large variety. The town is a short walk away filled with restaurants and nice stores.
I would return again and urge to you treat yourself to a wonderful 5 star resort.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1594,The club at legian is outstanding,50,January 2013,"Just returned from staying at a one bedroom villa at the Club at the Legian (not the main Legian hotel - across the road). The room rate includes a butler who made our stay truly superb. We initially didn't know what to ask him to do but once you get used to it there is no going back (Hendra - you are fantastic!). The Club is quiet and slow paced, although you get full access to the Legian Hotel across the road if you wish. The villas are huge, private pools are large, all drinks (including beer and basic spirits) included and the personal butler delivers whatever you want whenever you wish. The staff truly go out of their way to make your stay memorable with lots of little things like not many hotels do. You really do feel very looked after.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1595,Outstanding!!,50,January 2013,"Just returned from 6 nights at the Legian, fantastic experience. We were upgraded on arrival to a 1 bedroom suite as we wanted to stay on the ground floor so our 1 year old son could play on the lawn in front of the suite, spacious and very well appointed, huge bathroom and great view over the lawn to the ocean.
Staff were outstanding, nearly all the staff took the time to remember our son's name and always spoke to him, very helpful in any way, nothing was an issue for them.
Pool staff were great, great to get fresh iced water and cold face towels, as soon as you went for a swim your towels were fixed up and water always topped up, we nearly always managed to get the large bale's that were totally shaded, great for our son.
Also loved the evening sweet snack left every night during the turn down service, they even asked what time suited our son's sleeps for housekeeping and turn down service, truly great service.
The GM of the hotel was also frequently around and always stopped to speak, he was there on our departure and thanked us for staying with them. Airport transfer was excellent, water towels and a team member waiting at the airport who took luggage right up to check in counters, great way to end the holiday, except for a 6 hour Virgin Airline delay!
Highly recommend anyone wanting 5 star luxury and service to book at the Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1596,Perfect,50,December 2012,"Stayed her in December 2012 and I could not fault this hotel. As soon as the staff saw us walking towards the pool area they would look for a deck chair for us, lay down the towels and supply free iced water. Poolside service was excellent. One day I complained that my beer was not cold enough so the bar staff put half a dozen beers on ice for me and kept asking me all afternoon if my beer was cold enough, now that's exceptional service. I found all bar, food and front desk staff excellent in all areas of services. This is a 5 star resort with very reasonable food and drink prices. Another positive is there is no road between the resort and the beach which keeps a lot of the hawkers away.
My wife and I have stayed at many resorts in Seminyak and this is one of the best. Breakfasts are fantastic. One morning Roger the GM walked through the breakfast area talking to all the guests making sure everyone was happy. I really could not fault this resort and will be coming back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1597,THANK YOU JETSTAR,50,January 2013,"Only reason we stayed at this wonderful hotel was due to JETSTAR cancelling our flight back to Sydney. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was immaculate the staff are amazing but not in your bubble, we were given a late check out at 6 pm normal time 12 noon we spent our full day at the 3 pools had an amazing breakfast including the best chicken curry outside of South Africa the GM Personally came and said goodbye a first for me and I have travelled extensively the hotel transfer vehicle had cold bottled water fresh towels and a person at airport to take us thru to customs if we ever do Bali again it would only to stay at this hotel.
Only one downer the beach ain't great",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1598,Truly deserves the 5-star rating,50,December 2012,"On my last trip to Bali, I've decided to try The Legian because of all the good things I've heard about this hotel. The starting price of the rooms here was more expensive than most of the other properties in the proximity, so I had high expectations. And I wasn't disappointed... the service throughout was helpful and friendly, even the General Manager had the time to greet me during check-in.

I stayed in a deluxe room, which was really spacious (balcony, kitchenette, extra toilet) and had all the amenities you could hope for. There were nice touches like pre-loaded iPods (combined with an excellent stereo system) and a map of surrounding area. I also liked the list of movies you can borrow at no charge; the selection was well chosen.

The public areas, while not super-big like in a resort, are stylish and well-kept (really liked the lobby/library area). Of course another highlight is the beach-fronting infinity pool. One thing they didn't have was a business centre or even one or two PC stations. But I don't imagine many people go here with this in mind, anyway. Besides, wi-fi is included in the room price and there's good signal throughout the hotel.

I was really impressed with my experience at The Legian. Would definitely come back again, or try the neighboring property (The Club).",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1599,*** Not just a hotel but a wonderful experience that will bring you back ***,50,January 2013,"Words cannot describe the experience we had while staying at The Legian. When we first arrived we stayed in a deluxe room in the hotel. Stunning: spacious and very well appointed. the decor is a mixture of Balinese traditional and modern. We then transferred to a one bedroom villa at The Club which is just across the road. This is our sixth trip to Bali but our first time here and we have 'hit the jackpot'. We have stayed that the Sheraton properties, the Ritz Carlton in Jimbarran Bay, the Westin but NOTHING comes close to or compares with The Club at The Legian. Why? The Club at The Legian is totally unique. The staff are amazing: nothing is too much trouble. They are friendly and genuinely want you to have a wonderful experience. But most importantly, the staff are so proud of the Legian Brand. They love working for the property. They love their job and that makes a huge difference when it comes to hospitality. It's not just a job to them, they are part of the Legian team and the Brand. The villas are stunning: spacious and well appointed and the attention to detail is outstanding: frangipanis strewn over the bed for the turn down service. If you stay at The Club you have access to all the facilities at the hotel. The Club is very exclusive and private. If you are travelling with children, the hotel is probably the best option as you are very close to the beach and there is more for the kids to do. if there are 2 of you or even 4 adults, The Club is the way to go. The pool is sensational. Everything about this hotel is premium. Why will I be back? Simply: the staff. Hotels can have similar hard products: restaurants, pools rooms etc but it's the staff and their genuine care and attention to detail that is worth every cent. Do yourself a favour, give the Legian a try. It's simply sensational.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1600,Back second time and it's still outstanding!,50,November 2012,"For us The Legian is the best place to stay in Bali. I absolutely love their gorgeous specious rooms, their professional outstanding service and the most delicious tom yam soup! It is a 5 star all the way around from grounds to hospitality. This time we also got a deal. We stayed 4 nights and only paid for 3 including breakfast and soft drinks from mini bar. Their pool area is well maintained and beautiful. They offer a complimentary tea with cookies at midday there. Once you laid out you get an ice water and fresh hand/face towel. One thing tho I like to have a morning mimosa laying out by the pool, which turned out to be a 30 dollar one each day , because they use an actual nice champagne for it. I would't mind if they used prosecco;). Breakfast buffet was delicious. Besides the buffet you get to order an omelette or an eggs benedict...etc a la cart, but also complimentary. It was my BDay this time travel. We were picked up by the hotel's fancy car( which we arranged over an email) on time and arrived to the hotel just a little passed midnight. They had all the info on us saved from last time we visited, so the check in went so fast and smooth. We went straight to our accommodations where fresh drinks and welcome sweets were waiting for us along with all the check-in paper work.The next day at breakfast my boyfriend surprised me with a Champagne , carrot cake and a candle. They arranged everything perfectly. It was very sweet the way they did it. The carrot cake was delicious, the Bday song was not nosy or annoying and I got to make my wish.Than back in the room I had gorgeous flowers waiting for me. He asked for it they made it happen! During our stay we also used the GYM( fresh coconut water,water, apples...etc), Sauna and the Spa. At the Spa we had a couples massage, which was so relaxing and romantic. What can I say look no further it's a best place in town!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1601,just perfect,50,January 2013,"The Legian offers all that can be expected from a Leading Hotel of the World. Room, staff, restaurant, service and the rich breakfast are just perfect. Also the snacks near the pools have that outstanding quality: the best sate that we have eaten during an almost three weeks stay on Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1602,5 Star Resort,50,January 2013,"You Hear of Hotels saying they are a 5 Star Resort, and when you arrive you feel a bit let down,
This is definitely not the case at The Legian, as soon as you arrive at the airport you can opt to be greeted at immigration for $45 per person to save all the queuing, you go straight through, then driven to the hotel by a luxury vehicle, you are greeted by the Management who guide you around the resort before showing you to your room, We were booked in for one night in The Main Hotel in a One Bed Deluxe sea facing Suite, and Seven nights at The Legian Club staying in a One Bedroom Villa with a personal Butler (A young Lady called Chandra who was Excellent)
Both the Suite and villa were clean & spacious, and I would recommended both,
But if you want a total relaxing private holiday away from other guests, The Club is the place to stay, a private gated Villa with pool, outside covered bath, outside eating area where your butler will bring you your Breakfast or Evening Meal to you, a free of charge mini bar, a total chill location,
The Main Restaurant is first class, with a first class menu, while we were staying there I mentioned to the Hotel Manager (Kevin) that it was My Wife's Birthday, and that I would like to arrange a special evening meal, Kevin said no problem leave it to Me, He called Me the next day with a suggested private menu, which looked amazing, we arrived to a truly beautiful private table laid outside on the beachfront, The meal was exquisite, My Wife said this was one of her best Birthdays she has ever had,
We would like to thank all The Legian Hotel employees for a Truly Five Star Experience,

1603,5 Star Holiday,50,December 2012,"For my partners 50th we decided to celebrate via 5 star. The Legian is everything one could wish for in 5 star accommodation, beautiful & spacious rooms, exceptional staff that simply cannot do enough for you, great food, fantastic swimming pool & surrounding area, absolute beach front location & management that walk around all day meeting & greeting guests with genuine enthusiasm. If you intend going to Bali & are looking for somewhere ""special"" to stay, The Legian is the place to stay...you won't be disappointed !!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1604,Outstanding service,50,December 2012,Spent an excellent New Year at the Legian with my family. The staff are exceptionally friendly (but not fawning) and competent. Special mentions for the Concierge and the poolside teams. Rooms very large and comfortable. All amenities excellent. Overall a superb experience.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1605,Perfect Vacation!,50,December 2012,"The Legian Bali impressed from arrival to departure with impeccable service, superior accommodations and fantastic food & beverage. We spent three wonderful days (and nights) at this amazing beach-front property from December 24 - 27, 2012 and only wish we had stayed longer. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with oversized bathrooms, large indoor and outdoor sitting areas, desk, wifi and queen size bed. With many new hotels opening up in the Seminyak as well as many other areas in Bali this is is definitely one of the older hotels but it has kept itself current and can compete with newer, modern properties on all levels, e.g. W Retreat and Spa (see separate review) or also St. Regis, Alila and Anantara where we stayed on previous occasions. The service is outstanding and the pool area right next to the beach is the perfect place to relax and unwind. The breakfast is amazing, as was every other meal we had at the hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1606,Could not fault The Legian,50,November 2012,"I had the pleasure of staying in the Studio Suite at The Legian on a work related trip in November 2012. The room was immaculate as was the service throughout our stay. We only stayed 2 nights and I would not hesitate to stay again. I am quite the fussy traveller and do like the best of comforts when I travel and The Legian exceeded all my expectations. The view from our ground floor room was just gorgeous and a short walk across the gardens to the pool area. The room was huge with a bathroom almost as big as the room again. A lovely king size bed with amazing pillows ensured a restful sleep every night. Breakfast was also amazing with the attentive and friendly staff cooking anything for you upon your request from the delicious menu. They could not do enough to make you feel welcome and very well looked after.
Luxury at it's finest!! :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1607,Back Again...,50,November 2012,"As it was my best friend's 50th Birthday, so I decided to bring her to The Legian. My husband & I have stayed in The Club at the Legian & loved it, but we decided to stay in a 1 bedroom suite in the hotel. Well, what can I say, except to say that it was the perfect Girls Break! We were totally exhausted (relaxed) by the pampering. Morning beach walk, swim, yoga overlooking the beach, breakfast, swim, spa treatments, lunch, swim, afternoon tea, swim, sleep, Seafood dinner at the hotel! Our greatest dilemma was that it was so difficult to leave the hotel!!!
The staff are wonderful and it was nice to see the Hotel Management also taking an active interest in the guests.
Thanks to all of the staff, Inc pool staff etc, for their kind & friendly attention. And to The Club staff (particularly Arisna, our butler) for their welcoming smiles and service, when I returned a week or so later with my husband!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1608,The best around,50,December 2012,"In according to the many people we talked to and in according to our own feelings, The Legian hotel is the best experince you can get in Seminyak. Hotel is so good and Palm beach with its sunsets and nice cocktails is so great, while surrounding is so awful, you just want to stay all the time in the hotel. Service was perfect. 5 star class indeed. Great experience for 2-4 days max. Would not recommend to stay longer as absolutely nothing to do around while its a pain to go anywhere else due to enourmous traffic (it took us 2 hours to go from airport to Ubud) and 1,5 hours from The Legian to the airport (which is on site from the hotel). Recommend to take hotel car to the airport, as at least you spend this time in the best car on the road :)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1609,Christmas breakfast in the club,50,December 2012,"My wife and 3 children aged 11, 9 and 4 and in-laws are staying in a beautiful villa at The Club at The Legian Hotel in Seminyak for Christmas and New Year. I can highly recommend The Club villas if you wish to relax and unwind. The villas are spacious, private, have a lovely pool and are serviced by a very attentive butler catering for your every need, (my shirt was pressed in 5 minutes and delivered back!), not to mention a fully stocked mini bar daily and laundry service. The Club Lounge also offers complimentary drinks 6pm to 8pm and is only 1 minute away from the Legian Hotel if you want to use their facilities. Your butler will take you in a buggy if you wish. If you are considering Bali and want luxury, location and great service look no further The Legian offers all and more in abundance. Our butler has even offered to take my son on a surf trip!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1610,There is Service ...and then there is Service,40,December 2012,"If you are like me, you like Service and be pampered when staying in a high class Hotel. We had a week to assess and judge and conclude the Legian has two great assets: Nr. 1 - a Management Duo of professionals who make the best out what they have on hand. Nr. 2 - a team of staff with impressive service to the extend that during meals it becomes overbearing (I like to enjoy a meal without constantly being interrupted. With all due respect, the staff shows off a well trained service competence but ....alas...display an overkill when waiter number 5 comes to your table, repeats your name and asks how you are doing - and all within 10 minutes).
The Hotel offers a nice pool setting for chill out and relaxation. Trust me, wheather permitting you will be able to relax while enjoying watching surf and sunsets. The Hotel itself will be undergoing much needed renovation during the next months (or so we have been told) and the substandard outfittings of rooms, elevators and spa should be then worthwhile raving about. Until then, enjoy well meant and best of service and quality massages.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1611,Perfect,50,January 2012,First time i stayed ther was 1 years ago.But i still remember all the peace and warm for the employee. cant wain to come back this Christmas. good view and excellent room hotel. My kids love this place so much even the beach more like private beach so no one interrupt us while we;re playing with our kids.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1612,Go for the club wing,50,December 2012,"We were really impressed with The Legian. The club villas are impressive. Having a personal butler at ones beck and call is fantastic. Our butler, Wayan, was just perfect. Additionally, the club wing provides a hotel car for pick up and drop off to the local shops and restaurants up to 10pm which means savings on taxis. The spa is also pretty impressive and we would recommend the java sea wave massage and hot stone combo which lasts 90mins but you only pay for 60mins (for the month of December only). The general manager is really welcoming and seems to have a good handle of things. A great place to stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1613,Amazing Resort...exceeded expectations!,50,December 2012,"This was my first time in Bali and lets say The Legian made the holiday! I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I return. The resort exceeded expectations in all areas. We stayed here with out 5 month old baby and the staff we so helpful. The rooms are huge, and the view of the ocean every morning and the sound of the waves is priceless. I think the Legian has the beat pool in Seminyak....iThe GM and all the staff made the stay pleasurable! I would return back to the Legian in a heart beat!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1614,The Absolute Perfect Holiday,50,November 2012,"This Hotel is the absolute best. If you want to really do yourself a favour book a holiday at the Legian. It far exceeded our expectations. We booked a deluxe 1 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor, the views were just beautiful. The room (more like a small apartment) was amazing. The terrace has a day bed which became our favourite place to watch the day start and the sun set. We arrived at the resort and just didnt want to leave, everything was perfect. Service always efficient and discreet. The staff are so friendly and totally professional. The GM Kevin introduced himself on our arrival and always greeted us. This is the first time that this happened to us and we travel a lot. He certainly appeared to be always watching the overall running of the Hotel and it shows. The new infinity pool is outstanding and many hours were spent hanging off the edge and watching the ocean. We dined several times at the restaurant and the food was always excellant. We spent 4 nights in the main Hotel and 4 nights in the Villas which are across the road. I loved the Villa and especially our Butler Wayan he was awesome and just did so much for us to make our holiday special but I dont think I will go back to the Villas but only because of the view from our room in the main Hotel. It was spectacular. Cannot wait to return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1615,amazing hotel,50,December 2012,the hotel is right on the beach and all suites facing the beach. really relaxing and has very good service. the beach is amazing and location is very near the shopping area. the manger rohaan chandra actually is on the floor at the hotel actually supervising. never seen such a thing good work rohaan chandra that is why hotel has won the award. the breafast is amazing try the local stuff. we had room 431 was huge over 100 sq mts. everything was perfect . worth a stay. they even have a vegetarian menu . really top of the line.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1616,Absolute luxury on the beach!,50,November 2012,"This hotel was the highlight of our trip to Bali. Everything was 5 star from the huge, comfortable rooms to the stellar service and food. There are 60 rooms in the hotel but doesn't feel crowded at all. We were easily able to get lounge chairs and the attendants always make sure you have two towels and cold water. The hotel is beautiful (not so much from the outside), but it's an amazing place to stay on a nice part of the beach. We took a walk down towards Kuta Beach and it got noticeably worse. The beach is clean and peaceful where this hotel is. I found the waves to be a bit high for me to go swimming but the hotel has an incredible three level infinity pool. We will definitely be back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1617,All-Suite Ocean Hotel,50,October 2012,"Rooms are huge and the view from the second floor is excellent. We had our breakfast on our terrace which was a great way to start (I am tired of those busy buffet.) So we loved it this way.
Food is fairly overpriced but you have so many restaurant outside that it is not a problem.
The architecture from outside looks a bit like stone castle and is not very delicate in my opinion but once you get in your room, it is very pleasant. Service is good though we had one bad experience but this was an exception.
I had a shirodara massage. Expensive but nice.
In conclusion, this is a typical luxury hotel, you pay everything twice. You pay the room but then all the services come with a high price tag.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1618,A fabulous luxurious end to our honeymoon,50,October 2012,"Wow! Great service, from the welcome, with a refreshing Balinese drink whilst checking in from a sofa, right through to the hotel staff member negotiating us through the minefield that is the airport.

Our suite was bigger than our house, with a stunning bedroom, lounge, bathroom, kitchen area, dining area and guest toilet! The turn down service each day involved us being left a poem about local environmental elements, as well as a dish of treats on our dining table. Sleeping in a four poster surrounded by white muslin was very relaxing, and our luxurious lounger on the balcony was a great place to watch sunset from.

Sleeping with the sound of the waves hitting the shore was just great, and so relaxing.

Plenty of sun beds and very attentive staff making sure you were fed and watered around the pool were great. The three tiered infinity pools were gorgeous and really
made you feel you were swimming alongside the ocean.

We got a complimentary four course meal as we were honeymooners - the food was fabulous, and we felt really bad not to be able to eat all of it! Drinks at the hotel are not cheap, prices a little higher than other similar hotels we stayed in across Asia.

We were slightly surprised at how many young children there were at the hotel - not a problem for us, but unusual for a high end hotel.

The spa was great, to have a Balinese massage in a gorgeously appointed room, again with the sound of the ocean audible alongside the relaxing music is hard to beat.

We'd recommend walking along the beach in the evening to try some of the local beach bars and live music.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1619,The Legian just gets better,50,September 2012,"We have stayed at The Legian a number of times and it remains a favourite.

The ambience, service and position make The Legian an exceptional place to stay in Bali. Since our last stay in July 2011, half the hotel has been refurbished and many of my old concerns have been remedied. The airconditioning is quiet and the newly refurbished bathrooms are excellent. I understnd the remainder of the renovations will be completed by May 2013.The standard of the rooms and facilities is now very good and the addition of a large beach front lap pool adds significant benefits.

The hotel is also under a new general manager and as a result the whole place looks sharper and the attention to detail within the hotel and in the gardens is noticeable.

The Legian is not a large hotel and this helps to create a warm and friendly atmosphere. The staff seem to remember your name and your individual likes and dislikes in a way that makes it a very relaxing place to stay.

The food is varied and of a very high quality although I still find the evening restaurant a little formal and expensive if you are entertaining a young family as we were.

The Legian continues to get better and we will be returning.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1620,"Great location, arrogant overbearing staff and mediocre food",20,October 2012,"What a great view from the restaurant, wonderful, very special atmosphere with lovely lighting and superb feel. In fact we were there for just one evening meal and it was probably worth paying the overpriced bill and putting up with the staff just to be in this place - especially if your hotel is less well located.

However, and sadly its quite a big BUT, this hotel suffers from the arrogance common to many tropical hotels in that it seems to believe that unless you are entirely satisfied, you must be wrong.

The waitress was overly attentive, coming to ask us if our meal was ok every 3 minutes, as did the wine waiter and the manager - even interrupting me mid sentence on a number of occasions as I was talking to my wife. I found this extremely irritating as I had come to dinner to spend some quality time.

We have eaten at many places around the world including some of the finest including Heston Blumental's 'Fat Duck' in Bray. Although not a professional chef, I enjoy cooking and take great pride in experiencing and preparing food.

I was therefore very surprised when my Braised Wagyu Shank with Traditional Spices and Eggplant turned out to be full of cartilage and gristle. I mentioned this to the waitress who sent the manager over. He explained to me with no apology that Wagyu beef contains fat and that it was slow cooked and that I must be making a mistake because this restaurant was of the highest quality. I'm telling you straight it was not marbling or well rendered fat - it was gristle, and in almost every mouthful.

Very disappointing that the food was so poor and the attitude of the staff was so arrogant and pompous.

On receiving the bill, there was then the unpleasant surprise of the highly over-priced gin and tonics before being asked to come with my credit card to what I can only describe as a dirty back room to enter my pin. I felt like they didn't believe that it was my credit card at all and that I had been brought to a 'secure area'.

Not impressed at all at the way I was treated by the staff.

Such a shame that these people rely on the beautiful location but neglect their ingredients, preparation and customer service. If they want to be considered to be in the top echelons of hospitality, they need to make some changes.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1621,Beach Bar - What a treat,50,October 2012,"We dined here for a late lunch, whilst not guests at the hotel we were welcomed and treated like VIPs!

Dining at the Beach Bar where we treated ourself to french champagne, complimentary breads, the most fantastic salad and delicious mixed satay for 2. It was perfect in everyway, the bar & pool manager (who's name unfortunately escapes me) was exceptional engaging us in welcomed conversation and humor, tip top service and the offer of beach towels to enjoy a plunge in their beautiful pool.

All this for less than $80AUD (french champagne $25 a glass included)

Would we do this again?

YES",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1622,Best Hotel of our honeymoon,50,October 2012,"My wife and I stayed at the Legian for 8 nights from Sep 28 to Oct 6th as part of our honeymoon. We had a great experience from start to finish and I can't recommend this hotel enough. Our arrival was painless, we had arranged the hotel pick up. On arrival at the property I found the check in to be efficent. We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe suite, rm 121, the room was well appointed, with a comfortable bed and excellent facilities. We stayed in four high end hotels on our travels including a 5 star in both Dubai and KL and I can safely say the service at the the legian was streets ahead. As nice as the property is, from location to all its facilities, it is the staff that I will remember best. The level of service was very good, and my wife and I could not have hoped for better service. Thanks from us both to the management and staff. Mr and Mrs H.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1623,Absolute Perfection in everyway,50,October 2012,"We booked the Legian based on great reviews from Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. We have just had 7 nights in a 1 bed suite, did I say suite, more like an apartment (131 on 3rd floor). The suite has a large living room overlooking the beach, a large dining room and a beautiful bedroom with large bathroom off that. The suite just did not lack for anything and we wished we could of taken the bed and pillows home with us. When you can get away from the room, then you have a whole resort below you. As it only has 69 suites, you never feel like the place is over crowded. Breakfast is included in the room rate and has an extensive range, with a choice of cooked meal as well, all served overlooking their 3 infinity pools that cascade towards the beach. Eddie, the Restaurant Manager was always there to greet you, have a chat and would never forget your name. All staff from the General Manager, Kevin, to the room staff were always keen to help and were all so friendly. We ate at their restaurant a couple of nights, including the Seafood Night, where tables are setup right above the sand, highly recommended.
The resort is very central to a number of good restaurants, within walking distance, along the beach - Ku Da Ta, La Lucciloa and Sea Circus are a few.
My wife and I have stayed in many excellent properties around the world and this is in the top two or three. We will be back !!!!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1624,Fabulous,50,October 2012,"My husband and i stayed at the legian for 6 nights in early October. The hotel is beautiful, chic, elegant and modern. We loved the breakfast, the pools, the sun beds and the service. There were plenty of sun loungers around and the location of the hotel means getting into town for food and drinks is very easy too. We rented their scooters for two day trips which was great fun too. We will definitely be coming back to the legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1625,Perfection in Paradise,50,October 2012,Returning to Bali after an 11 year absence we chose to book the The Legian. The hotel had been recommended by friends as their favorite spot to stay in Bali and after a wonderful 8 days there all I can say is we will return and it won't take 11 years this time.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1626,Wedding at the Legian,50,August 2012,"my husband and i got married at this hotel and had our wedding reception in the beach house. Everything was perfect. Considering i booked and planned everything from the UK the whole experience was stress free and the staff and events organiser Ngakan were all extremely helpful.
The food and wine were just lovely, the butlers in the beach house were so helpful and friendly and the beach house was just amazing. I cant fault the hotel/beach house at all and will definatly be returning for an anniversay.
The location is perfect as well, just on the beach, close to good reataurants and shops and the hotel felt very secure. And a visit to the hotel spa is a must, soooo relaxing!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1627,Honeymoon Wonderland,50,October 2012,"Currently staying at The Legian. Will be here for another few days.

My wife and I (recently married,but together 15+ years), have traveled and stayed in some of the nicest hotels in the world.

The Legian may be the best hotel we have ever stayed in.

Great location, great service, exceptional amenities, attentive staff is what makes this Suoer luxury resort one of the best in Bali.

1628,"The Legian ""kids club"" Bali.",40,September 2012,"We have been wanting to stay here for many years.... and have been to Bali more than 19 times.... Before we start writing - don't get us wrong - we don't dislike kids..... but our intention for this trip was to stay in an exclusive hotel, and have a few days of luxury with some quiet, quality time together, lazing around the pool, reading books, drinking cocktails and soaking up beautiful surrounds.
The Legian is a stylish, elegant hotel, and we fell in love with it once we arrived - esp at night - it's just gorgeous!
HOWEVER - we had left another hotel in Seminyak ( that had one child) to arrive to The Legian which had 15+ children daily taking over the main pool.... who were most of the time occupied two of the three pools.... we were quite surprised that having chosen this hotel for our 'couples time' to relax in an exclusive hotel to find so many families and kids, and found that we were rather disappointed!!!
We understand totally that families and couples with children travel and holiday together, and go to fabulous hotels too - infact ALL of our friends have families and stay at hotels around the world..... but we believed that the number of kids here outnumbered the adults easily!!
In saying that - staff were attentive, friendly and offered fantastic service at all times, the hotel was well kept, well maintained, rooms were great and it was truly a pleasure to stay there!
Breakfast was abundant and above exceptional! great food - lots of choices and delicious!!!
TIP for others: grab a double day bed by the lower pool level - lovely way to spend the day with your other half!!!
TIP - remember sun sets at 5:45pm - so get a seat facing the beach and enjoy a drink in this lovely pool location!
NOTE: If you're looking to spend quality 'couples time"" together and don't want a hotel with LOTS of kids - perhaps look elsewhere.
Overall experience: Fantastic!!!! However, it's back to The Samaya for us!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1629,The Jewel in Seminyak,50,September 2012,"We have just stopped there for 7 nights and can honestly say we could not fault it. The setting is brilliant to start, set right on the beach with lovely gardens and fish ponds. You are immediately away from the hustle and bustle of the town. The staff were all with no exception the most friendly and helpful people that you could wish to meet, making the holiday that little extra special. We were upgraded to a studio room which was amazing and the little extra touches like complimentary water and a selection of freebies in the mini bar were very much appreciated along with the evening local sweets served to the room. The breakfast choice had all the things you could possibly expect. We dined at the restaurant a couple of times at lunch and also at diner and this too was excellent, with of course a lovely view of the sea making it a brilliant setting to dine.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1630,Romantic 5*,50,October 2012,"We stayed for one night at the Legian Club, opposite from the main hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were provided with outstanding service from our personal 'Butler' who was on call for the duration of our stay and who attended to our every need from providing our afternoon tea, drinks, canapés and then arranging our dinner reservation and booking the complimentary car service. The one bedroom villa was very spacious with a four poster bed, separate study area, large sitting area and dressing area with separate shower. The sitting area hosted a range of complimentary drinks and nibbles, while a fridge in the outside storage area was filled with essential items, although we didn't use this. The garden area was very well kept with a personal 10m swimming pool and a very large bath under cover which was perfect for a candle lit hot bath when the rain started.

I would have no hesitation in recommending the Legian Club for anyone wanting a little luxury in the heart of Seminyak. We didn't have time to use the main pool and facilities at the Club but others that we met spoke very highly of the shared facilities.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1631,Always relIable,40,September 2012,"Back for our third time to the legian. They have freshened up the properly and added another swimming pool and increased the deck area. This hotel is standing the test of time well.. Got lots going for it. Great location and aspect, generous rooms and more than required facilities. I'd say it's good value for the price - even though at the upper end of the price specturm still you feel it's money we'll spent. Two stand outs compared to four seasons and st Regis, service and F&B. On both these elements the legian is way way way ahead of its competitors. Might have something to do with the fact the GM and senior management are always walking the hotel, meeting guests and making fine adjustments. Didn't see senior managment at the others and often never do.

The legian is a pass and is still holding its own",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1632,Expensive but Flash!,50,March 2012,"Stayed here for three nights with partner after a conference over at Nusa Dua. Obviously high class from the moment you walk in. Room was as big as my house, nice pool, great staff. Would stay again on next visit to Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1633,The best 5 star of its type I've ever stayed in!!,50,September 2012,"I'm writing this as a very fussy traveller staying in 5 star hotels, This hotel did not disappoint. The location is perfect, right in the heart of Seminyak and located right on the beach. It's grounds and swimming pools are exceptional and all maintained to a very high standard. We stayed in a studio suite and is all you need, they're very large and well laid out. They have the decor just right with a traditional Balinese feel but modern with Bose surround sound and high quality furniture and products.
The management have it just right here with exceptionally trained staffed in all areas. The place has a real family feel which to me makes it well managed and the staff enjoy working there. Any request is seen to immediately and they go over and above expectations.
As it was our honeymoon we were so pleased to have made the right decision choosing the Legian. We did get to see some of the other high end hotels we had considered before booking, like the Samaya locate next door, and we we're so happy to have made the right decision.
I never normally go back to the same hotel despite the experience, however, We will certainly be returning to The Legian for a wedding anniversary in the near future!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1634,Best Place to be in Seminyak,50,June 2012,"Being well informed on the Bali hotspots, this hotel in Seminyak is one of the best. Best location, on the beach close to where all the top restaurants are at and next to Kudeta, it has high quality service, serves good food, and all with a lot of class. Highly recommend when in this area.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1635,"A beautiful hotel, wonderful place to stay",50,July 2012,"The Legian is a wonderful place for a week in Bali. The hotel is right on the beach and the gardens and the view of the sea are beautiful. The three horizon pools run into each other, and the third one is a lap pool.

The staff are very professional, and looked after us very well, especially when it came to restaurant bookings and organising a day trip to Ubud. They could not have been nicer or more attentive.

The restaurant is excellent - the dinner we had was among the best we had during the week there (expensive however). The breakfast each morning was to die for - a real highlight!

Our suite was extremely comfortable with a large balcony with a day bed so you could read and look at the sea.

One of the best things was the location. We could walk to Ku De Ta, the Oberoi, and to some basic shops and markets. It was a quick taxi trip to get to the main Seminyak shopping strip to try on clothes, shoes etc. But it was not so busy that we felt overwhelmed by traffic the minute we walked out of the hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1636,Stay at least two nights-Date Nights,50,July 2012,"Having Date weekend,perfect when you never want to leave the resort and pool-beach just orsm....... You love the indian ocean from all rooms in the resort ,try not to stay in the room ,there are plenty sun lounges with losts of privacy if needed
Its the most secure Hotel in Bali",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1637,Will return,40,August 2012,"My family and I spent a few days at the Club at the Legian which is their villa compound across the street from the hotel. We stayed in their largest villa, a 3 bedroom property. The villa is a walled in compound comprised of three balinese style structures: a master suite with dining room, a small kitchen (in need of maintenance) and a two floor structure housing 2 large suites each with its own tv siting area. A ten metre lap pool and garden is at the centre of the compound. The rooms are very nicely designed, very clean and comfortable but probably due for refurbishment to justify the rate. The villa comes with a lot of services including a dedicated butler. Murta, our butler, was great.

The walk from the Villa to the Legian restaurant/beach takes 5 minutes but a golf cart is available if you need it. The Club has its own restaurant (highly recommend the singapore slaw), bar, and a large swimming pool that doesn't get much use, the three level ocean front infinity pools at the hotel are much nicer.

We had already spent a few days in Bali when I booked and I can comfortably say I looked at most if not all of the ""5 star"" properties in Seminyak, Jimbaran and Uluwatu. The Legian is probably the nicest beach front property in Bali, centrally located in Seminyak, very attractive design, not too big, good food, highly competent management--Kevin, the GM, goes out of his way to make things right.

We will probably return to Bali and will not hesitate to stay at the Club at the Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1638,Stayed for our honeymoon a little disappointed in the room,30,June 2012,"We stayed here from the 4-19th June for our honeymoon. It is a lovely hotel but we were a little disappointed in the room we were given. The staff were friendly enough but we felt that they were a lot more attentive to regular guests. There was absolutely no entertainment which we found a little bizarre, we couldn't stay in the hotel of an evening we had to go out every night if we wanted to be entertained. Food was lovely a little two over priced so again we had to go out for food or lunch. One side of the hotel was completed when we were there yet they didn't move us to a nicer room considering it was our honeymoon. The room we were in was 123 it was very dark, the view was blocked by palm trees so couldn't see much from our balcony, it was a alright room but a bit dated. You may think I'm being a bit harsh but I'm saying this because on our last day we given a complimentary room to freshen up before we come home & this room was massive, brighter better way nicer than the room we were put in and it was only the floor above our room. If we got treated with a little more attention like the other guests we would probably come back. Most staff were absolutely fantastic but not everyone.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1639,Incredible,50,August 2012,"Why go anywhere else.. Breakfast... outstanding, service...friendly and they bend over backwards, 2 bedroom suite.. Priceless... I'm already planning my next trip. The new pool is awesome, and the whole five days there were easy and effortless.. Seriously the best",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1640,A truly special place,50,August 2012,"My husband and I chose the legian for our first stop on honeymoon and it was the best decision we could have made. Staff made us feel very special leaving us a card and cake when we first arrived. The rooms are incredible and the setting overlooking the beach, is perfect. I could not fault this hotel at all and hope to return in the future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1641,Relax in luxury,50,July 2012,"We spent the first 2 nights of our honeymoon at the The Legian in early July, as we had a quick stopover in Bali before heading east to Sulawesi, and it couldn't have been more perfect. We were picked up at the airport and whisked away to the hotel with cool towels and fresh water, which was very welcome after 3 flights to get us there.
The attention to detail is wonderful, the restaurant staff know your name, you are provided with iced water (regularly replenished) at your sunlounger, the food was great, the rooms were wonderfully spacious and comfortable...
What with the exhaustion of the wedding / longhaul flights we didn't venture much past the hotel for the 36 hours we spent there, but the little I saw from the airport to the hotel has changed incredibly from the Bali I knew in 2001, when I spent 6 weeks travelling there. In my opinion for the worse, and I wouldn't choose to spend a whole holiday there, but The Legian was the perfect haven for our little stopover, and to relax in total luxury.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1642,Best Experience,50,July 2012,"I had a ground floor unit in July 2012. The rooms were huge and so stylishly finished.
The service was the best I have experienced - really.
The food at the resturant was as good as I had at the other well known eateries (but perhaps slightly more expensive as well).
I will be going back without a doubt.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1643,"Excellent service, wonderful hotel",50,July 2012,"Just spent a wonderful week at the club and the legian where the service was excellent. Bona our butler, Edward the restaurant manager and in fact all of the colleagues at the legian have fully embraced everything we hear about high customer service - with a genuine smile! I have absolutely no reservations in recommending this hotel over any other in the region. All I would say is be ready to be wooed by some awesome Balinese hospitality.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1644,My 'Home away from home'.,50,June 2012,"Just returned from our bi-yearly Bali holiday. Stayed at The Legian in Seminyak, and as usual - our 7th stay there - it was pure heaven. The suites are so very comfortable. The large balconies are fabulous to sit and watch the setting sun. The staff are unbelievable. They remembered our names from two years before, and couldn't do enough to make our holiday perfect. Breakfasts are great. The treatment around the pool is fantastic too. Cold towels, and ice-water which is replaced regularly.
Can't wait for our next stay there. Hopefully in two years.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1645,Wonderful place.,50,June 2012,"At our arrival I was not disappointed to hear that one of the ordered rooms was not available as we were offered an upgrade. My son and his girlfriend stayed in the ordered room which already was quit big and beautiful. Our - upgraded - room was almost too big and even more beautiful. Impeccable service, e.g. last day we asked for a late check-out (16.00h) which was immediately granted for the biggest room. At the same time enough fresh towels were brought to that room to accommodate the showering of 4 people instead of 2.
Pool deck has stunning view over the ocean and even there service is really great.
If I ever go back to Bali and want to spent a few days at the beach to relax I know where to go!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1646,Even better than last time!,50,June 2012,"We stayed at the Legian between 15th and 23rd June in a deluxe suite. We arrived a little flustered quite late. The car we had ordered did not arrive to pick us up, we waited and looked around for half an hour, and ended up getting a taxi to the hotel. We explained the car organised by the hotel did not arrive, and the staff at the hotel were very apologetic, and offered us a complimentary return car when we checked out on the 23rd. It did not take us very long to relax and settle into the wonderful ambience of the Legian. The staff are so kind and gentle, and our room and surrounding hotel grounds were heaven. Breakfast was brilliant again, on day one my husband asked if there was vegemite, and every day after a waitress would bring us vegemite without us even asking. The hotel grounds are just beautiful, and they've put in a lap pool too. Last time we stayed here I swam in the ocean because I didn't want to disturb the peace of the relaxing pools, but being able to swim in the lap pool for a bit of exercise was just brilliant. I was going to do a yoga session on Thursday, but I got sick Wednesday night, and was out for the count on Thursday. Would be great if the Yoga was on every second day instead of twice a week, and perhaps a little earlier than 8am, still it's complimentary, and from memory, the classes were excellent, so I shouldn't complain. Thank you Legian for another wonderful holiday!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1647,Incredible!,50,June 2012,"We stayed at the Legian Bali for 3 nights and were sad to leave-it was an outstanding stay- perfect for us.
We had booked the Studio Suite, which was on ground level and about 20 meters from the beach and we could hear the waves at night. The suite was beautiful, and had a little kitchenette and wonderful bed/living room and amazing bathroom.
We spent a lot of time by the pool during the day and enjoyed both snacks and lunches there- all super tasty.
The hotel is not too big so it was not too crowded but very relaxing.
Service was impecable from start to finish- and we also loved the location of the Legian Bali; near everything but also not in the middle of chaos and noise. 100% going back next time in Bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1648,Like always perfect,50,June 2012,"End june 2012 we stayed @ THE Legian the new pool looks great and the service was like always perfect And on à personal level .
Bigger rooms with al stunning seaview you will not find .
À small note is that i think the breakfast get bored when you stay longer but that is because im spoiled in premium hotels in Bangkok And Hongkong .
Looking forward to be there again on 19 july

1649,Beautiful luxurious hotel on the beach,40,May 2012,"This very luxurious hotel is situated right on the beach on a very popular stretch.
The hotel is big, but has a very intimite style, as the staff will greet you by name and are very helpful.
The rooms are excellent, with a large sitting area, lovely bathroom, and soft beds.
The room we had, had a balcony on the beach side, and it is just great to wake up and see the sea.
The gardens between the hotel and the beach are well kept and very stylish, with gorgeous flowers and trees.
The room had an ipod, with earplugs and an in-room docking station, and a beachbag.
The lounge area along the beach, has good sunbeds and the bar is close by.
They serve high tea!
The breakfast was very complete, lots of fresh fruit and any type of eggs we could wish for!
We did not dine in the restaurant. (went out to local places a stroll along the beach)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1650,"Perfect room, excellent food and amazing view",50,June 2012,"Cant think of one think about this hotel I didnt like except we only stayed for the weekend...did not want to leave. Our suite was so beautiful we had room service so we didnt have to go out!
And the room service was quick, ring for a drink and it arrived within 5 mins, 15 mins for food! was quicker than some restaurants we went to. Cant wait for my next trip, I know where I will be staying. It is on the expensive side but worth every cent.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1651,Legian Wedding Bliss,50,June 2012,"We have just returned from our wonderful wedding at the Legian, Seminyak! The resort, setting, staff and food were wonderful. Ngakan was always there to answer any queries we may have had and is a real credit to the wonderful hotel.

The resorts new pool area looks fabulous - we were lucky it opened 3 days before the wedding.

We had a lovely room and would highly recommend this property to anyone wanting a truly amazing holiday or wedding!

Thank you again everyone at the Legian for making our day so special, cant wait to come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1652,The Club at the Legian - best of both worlds!,50,June 2012,"We have just returned from five nights at this outstanding hotel. The Legian Hotel is situated on the beachfront, however we had booked a one bedroom villa at The Club, directly across the road. We had heard before we went that we should be staying at the main hotel, however we couldn't disagree more. From the minute we entered The Club we were treated like VIPs, and we were immediately introduced to our private butler, Toni, who we had the sole use of for the duration of our stay. Words cannot describe our first impressions when we entered in to the private grounds of our villa. We had just come from the Viceroy in Ubud and the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong, both amazing hotels, but this topped the lot. The private space you get is overwhelming. A fantastic pool, dining area, day beds and luscious gardens. The villa itself is very well equipped and generous in size. We liked the two fully stocked iPods and docking stations, and the advantage of staying at The Club is the free mini-bar, which is stocked with gin, vodka, whiskey, beer and a vast selection of soft drinks. Lots of nibbles too! An additional advantage is complimentary cocktails during happy hour, every day from 6pm until 8pm, perfect after a day of sunbathing! We cannot rate the Club enough, but one of the things we really liked was by staying here we could use all the facilities of the main hotel too, so we had the best of both worlds (hotel guests cannot use The Club). You can therefore choose to spend the day by the pool of the hotel, then retreat to your own private sanctuary thereafter - extremely romantic and perfect for honeymooners like us. You cannot beat a midnight dip in your own private pool ;) To the main hotel itself, the facilities are fantastic, and in particular the food and friendliness of all the staff is unrivalled - we were blown away by the quality of the food and felt it was reasonably priced versus other hotels on the island. The chef's tasting menu at your own 'intimate dinner' experience is very special and although we were already married, thought it would be the perfect way to propose to your loved one! Very attentive staff at the pool, always ensuring you are topped up with iced water, cold face cloths and suntan lotion. There is a new Swiss General Manager who introduced himself to us. The impression he gave us was that he was going to bring some new ideas to the hotel and The Club to make it even better, and therefore we can only imagine how great it will be then! 10 out of 10 on all aspects and we will definitely be going back and will stay at The Club every time.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1653,Best Day Ever,50,June 2012,"Firstly very big thank you to Ngakan Juliarta and his team for the best wedding day ever. We have just returned from a wonderful 2 weeks in Bali which included our daughters wedding at The Legian Seminyak. Ngakan and his team organised a afternoon and evening which all our guest will remember for a long time. From the excellent service to the food and magical venue we could not recommend this Hotel more highly.
Our daughter and her new husband stayed at the property for a few days and their accommodation was just great, beautifully appointed rooms and the pool area, even though under going some re-furbishment was just magical. New infinity pool just lovely. THANK YOU AGAIN NGAKAN for all your assistance",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1654,REALLY BAD,10,May 2012,Unfortunatly we stayed here and most of the staff were really helpful about everything but like most a selected few at reception really killed our holiday experience. Along with the 14+ year old rooms which are all in need of renovations i would heavily advise you that you would get a lot more bang for your buck elsewhere in the seminyak area ...... If i were you i would try the W hotel up the road 2 mins...... sorry guys really bad.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1655,Great Hotel but a little pricey,40,December 2011,"We checked in here after 3 nights at Royal Pita Maha in Ubud.

The hotel is very classy and about 5 mins walk to the main market.

The rooms are clean, hospitality is good (actually in any part of Bali), but a little pricey. The part about the rooms is that you get a complimentary Ipod with surround sound and some nice tracks loaded on it.

The pool is great and just on the beach.

The service is good and I would definitely recommend it for couples.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1656,Beach side Bali Bliss,50,June 2011,"I have stayed at The Legian repeatedly over the last 10 years. I would have been perhaps eight or nine times. The Legian is absolutely stunning. Unfortunately, the development of the neighbouring area, and particularly the hotel adjacent has impinged upon the serenity one use to feel, the real Balinese nature of the place. If you are looking for Bali, you need to go further afield now but if you are looking for beach, it doesn't get any better closer to Seminyak. The new Italian manager has made it more approachable and family friendly, although I did love the cool and smooth hospitality of the former Swiss manager, who had it running like clockwork. the food is better now though. Funny that!
If you've never been to Bali, spend 4-5nights here and go up to Ubud for another 4-5 or head to Chandidasa on the far side of the island. The former GHM hotel there (once called the Seria) is now an Alila hotel I believe. As is the former GHM property in Ubud.
I havent been there since the renovation so I would be interested to hear/see what has changed. I am not mad on the Club on the other side but if you want your own villa and pool it would make sense.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1657,Class act,50,April 2012,"Our first stay here, despite many visits to Bali. Wonderful hotel. Not quite up to Aman levels, but a wonderful place nonetheless. Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1658,Incredibly romantic - 5 star plus!,50,April 2012,"We stayed here for five nights in April and were blown away by the gorgeous villa, the superior service (better than anywhere I have ever stayed including the George V in Paris! Location is perfect if you want to wander, eat out or shop although we did not stray far from the villa:)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1659,"Amazing service, wonderful accommodations, excellent location",50,April 2012,"My wife and I were concerned about the ongoing construction at the Legian Bali, but found that any disruption was kept to a minimum. This is a quiet property, well situated near Seminyak restaruants and shops. The beach is sandy, the surf is strong, but there are vendors and an occassional horse. The suites are large, very thoughtfully designed and maintained -- most with great views of the pounding surf. Hint: bring your IPOD -- they provide IPODs, but you might enjoy your own music on the great Bose central music system. The restaurant memu is limited, but the food quality was very good. The dinner tasting memu was superb (well priced for the quality) -- the best food that we have experienced in many Bali restaurants. The pool situation during the renovation is limited, but the opening of the new lap pool will address this. Best feature, however, was the superb service -- professional and caring!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1660,"Great service, but not best in Asia",40,April 2012,"Like in most GMH hotels, service is fantastic here too. Yet the beach is just ok. Not too much to do for kids either.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1661,Luxurious relaxation,50,April 2012,"True luxury, the staff are superb - there whenever you need them but otherwise not intrusive. Wonderful location, our suite (all 1300 sq ft of it) was a delight, peaceful yet we could see and hear the waves crashing on the beach below. The current renovations were practically invisible and didn't disturb us. We'll be going back there, all the way from the UK!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1662,Fantastic location and best hotel in Seminyak,50,September 2011,"The Legian Bali is perfect for either a romantic getaway or for family trip. Service is good recommend going to to the sunset bara couple of buildings away - i think it was called Ku de ta.

We stayed in a Deluxe suite and the room was huge, we had a living room, kitchen, outdoor terrace and a big bathroom.

This hotel exceeded expectations - really enjoyed it for the 3 nights we were there.

Loved the fact that they give you your own ipod which you are free to take with you for the duration of your stay in the hotel",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1663,Amazing experience,50,March 2012,"We stayed at The Club at the Legian for our honeymoon in late March. Our stay completely surpassed all our expectations. The service was spectacular, the villa was larger than our house, and it is in the perfect location. We could not recommend it highly enough. In particular, our butler, Chandra, was beyond amazing. She made our stay so special and we wished we could have stayed for longer.
The only negative of the hotel was that there were significant renovations taking place at the main part of the hotel. While this didn't impact our stay too much as we were at The Club, it was disappointing not to have a good pool area or full restaurant facilities.
Otherwise, for a special occasion, it is the perfect hotel!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1664,The best!,50,April 2012,"We had our trip to Fiji cancelled at the last minute so we decided to go to Bali. We booked to stay at The Legian 2 nights before we left. A little unsure about what we were going to find due the current renovations. Once we got there we could not have been happier! The staff were so helpful and lovely. The studio room was absolutely amazing with a beautiful view of the grounds and beach. Plus the room was huge!

We had 2 massages while we were there and they were the best!

Everyone remembers your name! Just little things like giving us face towels that smell like frangipani and glasses of water while we sit on the sun lounges. It just made our experience fantastic.

As for the renovations...we hardly noticed they were there. Yes it does block some of the view from the pool to beach but we sat away from the pool next to palm trees and got a spectacular view! Using the pool to refresh.

Definately recommend this place and we will be going back for sure!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1665,Best breakfast ever!,50,April 2011,"PANCAKE HEAVEN!Staff amazing! Service 10/10. Staff are so polite and always there to give a helping hand. I didnt want to leave, they make you feel like your right at home. Very clean and always servicing your room:)

Amazing!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1666,'The Legian' best of the 3 hotels we stayed at while in Bali,50,January 2012,"We spent 12 days in Bali and thought we would spoil ourselves by staying our last 3 nights at The Legian and it was just wonderful. The rooms and hotel were fantastic in size, features and comfort. The hotel staff were the most helpful people we had com across in our stay in Bali. The night we left the concierge 'Ngakan' even offered to deliver some baby vitamins that my wife had bought from Australia for a women's and children charity foundation in Ubud, i tried to pay and he refused and said it wasn't a problem for him as his family lived in Ubud. This was just one of the many things that made our staff great. Our 18 month baby was treated like a princess and the hotel provided electric bottle sterilizer free of charge for cleaning her bottles etc.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1667,Paradise,50,September 2011,"Did I just wake up in paradise? The hustle and bustle of Bali's Kuta is left behind when you venture along the road to Seminyak and the wonderful Legian Hotel. Far enough away from some of the less savoury elements of Bali this oasis is not cheap but worth every cents - great Restaurants nearby or a courtesy bus away. Excellently appointed rooms, suites .
Excellent pool, services and spa
Lay back & enjoy..... even if the kids are with you
Will we go back - absolutley!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1668,We come back,50,February 2012,"Last year we had a good experience in this hotel and were glad to come back, and it was not a mistake. As my wife doesn't like elevators we had a spacious room on the ground floor.
We come back next year.

1669,Loved it!,50,October 2011,"This was one of our three hotels in our Bali Honeymoon trip and we loved it. When we arrived the staff set us up a lunch in our room and a bottle of wine to celebrate which was a great welcome!

Our room was huge and comfortable and the bathroom was great, I loved having double sinks.

There are a lot of extra touches which make The Legian stand out compared to other hotels. Every day you get a little snack in your room. You get free soft drinks which is amazing and there's lovely afternoon tea. Rooms are turned down each night and this is wonderful. There are also Ipods you can use which have a huge selection of music.

Breakfast was OK, I found it strange staff never seemed to remember who you are so we were asked for our room number every day despite staying for a week.

The pool area is nice and simple but the double sunlongers are great! Loved these! The beach is lovely and sunsets gorgeous. I liked watching the people flying (and selling!) kites on the beach. My husband had a great time in the sea, massive waves!

This hotel is in a great location as you can walk to the bars and restraunts in 5 minutes albeit down a dark alley! At first I was nervous but be assured we found it very safe with a number of security guards dotted along the way.

We loved it and would love to go back on day.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1670,Our favorite hotel in the whole world,50,June 2011,"My family and I went 5 times in this hotel, we think it's the best! The staff is so nice with children which is rare for a hotel like this one. The food is excellent, we always eat in the little restaurant near the pool. We had a luxurious suite, with a saloon, two bedrooms, a kitchen and a TV room. Everything is perfect and my family and I agreed to say that this is the best hotel that we ever stayed in!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1671,Heaven,50,January 2012,"We stayed at the Legian between Jan 28-Feb 4, it was truly wonderful, the best service we had in a hotel. We stayed in the One bedroom suite, it was very spacious with a big living area and a kitchenette. The restaurant was nice but there could be more variety.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1672,A low point,10,October 2011,"We stayed for two nights in a basic room. The room was big, certainly big enough, but we were given the furthest room overlooking an enormous building site (there was actually one on both sides of the hotel at the time) - and when we asked if they might have another room - they said they were fully booked - and that ""lots of people had complained about the building site - which is why they had placed a letter in each room- telling you about it.."" surely it would have been better to warn us in advance? i would recommend you contact the hotel to check - as they said it had been going on for a year - and looked no where near finishing.

In addition the food in the hotel wasn't good, the bed was uncomfortable, the airport collection arrived 1 hr late with no apology, quite a few of the beach beds were stained, my magazine and book were stolen from my lounger when I went to the bathroom, the swimming pools were extremely busy and the whole place just felt huge, dated and depressing.

On a happier note Seminyak was better than expected and had a few nice shops (within walking distance of the hotel) and several great restaurants. We had dinner one night at Sarong - which was exceptional - you have to book in advance - but would highly recommend. Taxis are really cheap and easily organised - cost about £1-2 to get to the restaurants. Ku de ta is no longer the place to be seen - but its a 1 minute walk to the hotel and still does great cocktails with a view so good place for a drink stop. Also wherever you stay don't bother with hotel airport transfers - there is an efficient and safe taxi service with a set price from the airport (exactly 10x less than the hotel rate) which you can sort out on landing.

I really wouldn't recommend this hotel - its not anywhere near good enough to justify the price. Its a package holiday hotel - which is fine if you pay that rate - but if thats not your thing or you are being hit for the full published price - run for the hills.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1673,Pretty Good...,40,January 2012,Stayed for 4 days in January. Upgraded to a one bedroom suite (always pays to book direct and avoid the 3rd party websites). Our room was very good and nicely appointed. The restaurant was of a very high standard and enjoyed the food. There could have been more local fare though. Only drawback I found was the pool was a bit small to cater for the number of guests in the hotel. Had to put up with other peoples noisy kids with no chance of escape. Apart from that it was a great stay. Thanks.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1674,The Best in Bali,50,February 2012,"The world tour continues and we are now back at our 'home' in Bali, The Legian, Seminyak. We come here every February to escape the European winter and we stay for a month. It's officially the end of the rainy season here and the hotels are all fairly empty so great deals can be had on rooms. And there is very little rain! This is our 7th consequitive year here. Its divine. Right on the beach. Great walking on the beach every day one way to the mess of Kuta but the other to miles and miles of wonderful open beach. Surfing if you want. And a short walk from the hotel is the fabulous area of Seminyak ideal for shopping and eating out. The rooms are spacious, as the hotel was originally built as an apartment block so you can get plenty of room! The food is terrific as are the staff. If you want a change from the hotel there's a great little Italian across the road which is very cheap. Also recommended is Le Entrecote and Bali Cafe nearby and upscale (expensive for Bali) is Metis, and Sarong.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1675,Wonderful hotel!!! beach so so...,50,February 2012,"Stayed there for 3 nights, on the one bedroom deluxe suite. The hotel is terrific! We were wellcomed by the staff when we left the car, check in very easy and ready for us on arrival, all explanations about the hotel and room amenities were fine. Room is REALLY nice - large, well decorated, comfortable, nice decor, perfect air conditioning (temperature outside was 33 dec celsius), beautiful view of the ocean.
Staff is fantastic. They all call you by your last name. Always ready to help, either on the swimming pool or at the restaurant. They prepared a nice tour for us, and I could rent a motorbike from the hotel - what I really recommend!
Very good breakfast, good drinks at the bar. Fruits and soft drinks complementary everyday in the room.
Semyniak beach, on the other hand, is not so nice for those used to white sandy beach. I was told by locals that here is the place to stay, but... I have been to nicer beaches in many countries.
For shopping and restaurants, that´s really good. Some nice streets on walking distance (or using the hotel´s shuttle or the motorbkie) make our stay even better - nice spot in Bali.
Overall, we are very happy here and recommend The Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1676,Great hotel,40,February 2012,My Wife and i stayed at the legian club in a private pool villa which included butler service complementary internet and car drop off to surrounding areas which we both thought was good value. The room was large and well appointed and the location of the hotel is great because it is nearby all the good restaurants and bars. The staff we very friendly pitty about the general manager who we walked past several times and we were never acknowledge by her this would never happen at the four seasons. All in all a great hotel.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1677,Perfection,50,February 2012,"My husband and I stayed here as a splurge the last two nights of our honeymoon. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite that's bigger than our condo at home! We've been treated like royalty here the entire time. The service is impeccable and anticipates everything you could want or need. If you can afford to stay here, by all means, do so. Of course the food and drinks are very expensive here, but there are less pricey options in seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1678,Happy returns,50,January 2012,"We stayed at the Legian for the second time and were welcomed back like old friends. We were upgraded and had beautiful suites opening on to the lawns. The restaurant, pool and facilities are fantastic. We think the rooms are a little dark but if you want restful, peaceful surroundings this is the place. Staff excellent and food terrific. Close to Seminyak for shopping but quiet and serene behind the facade.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1679,Great end to Bali Holiday,50,December 2011,"We stayed our last 3 nights of our trip at The Legian as a special present for my girlfriend.

Both of us loved the place, very relaxing and quiet. Service was also excellent, anything you wanted or needed was only too easy for the staff to accommodate.

If you do stay make sure to have dinner in the restaurant at sunset and order the chefs tasting platter, expensive by Bali standards but worth every cent and more. I went back the next night to have it again!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1680,luxury designer all suite hotel/best on east coast of bali,50,July 2011,"The only hassle about this fabulous hotel is mking sure you have the right place when makie the booking, as there are many hotels nearby with the name ""legian"" in them.

-The Legian is a member of The Leading Small Hotels of the World so that indicates the level of service to expect and that you will receive - also the price you will pay - but is worth it and try negotiating and booking through the hotel itself.

-the hotel is in all respects in immaculate condition - it is really impossible to tell when it was built [I suspect this century]- because everything, including the grounds- have been very well maintained

-The Legian is an all suite hotel and the suites are a design sensation that could have stepped out of Architectural Digest. Stayed in a one bedroom suite [see photos]. Entrance is by carved double wooden doors into a wide foyer that leads to a central dining room table. To one side of it is a large lounge room with writing table, after which there is also an ample balcony with double daybed facing the ocean. To the other side is a large curtained four poster bed, to the side of which is a substantial bathroom area with shower, bath and double vanity[ with two mirrors that innovatively are on either side of the long vanity table]. The suite also looks fantastic in the evening because of its lighting design.

-the suite floors are parquetry and the ceilings high. Indeed, the feel is of a luxury apartment and indeed, the hotel staff told me it was 110 square meters in area, but there are many even larger suites [eg the 2 bedroom ones are 50% bigger again]

- the suite includes premium entertainment equipment including large swivel TV, blu-ray player, Bose sound system and even iPods.

- the grounds are as manicured as a golf course and in them is a large infinity pool that has an al fresco dining area next to it. Overlooking the beach front are a number of luxurious daybeds. Surfing lessons are also available, although most of the time we were there the beach was closed because of rips.

-the breakfast/ dining room overlooks the pool. It is also fun to dine outdoors next to the pool in the evenings. The food is excellent and very good value for such a luxury hotel. For instance, one evening featured a ""Royal Balinese Feast"" including the famous ""babi guling"" roast pig - only $25. Another evening there were the endless courses of the famous Dutch colonialist inspired Rijstaffel - another bargain at $30

If you happen to be in a party of 6 [as some in our group were], seriously consider staying in the ""Beach House"". This is a huge walled off villa in the hotel grounds with in effect three suites on the first floor and vast entertaining areas and pool running to ocean on ground floor. Effectively its price is equivalent to what you would pay for three double suites, but you actually occupy a large, private villa[minimum three day booking was required when our group was there]

after having visited Bali for almost 40 years, I am happy to report this hotel is among the best there is and although it has equals [most even more expensive], there are none better on the famous Kuta/Legian/Seminyak surf strip of Bali",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1681,"Luxurious, Relaxation, Serene, Tranquility...",50,January 2012,"I guess my title says it all. The Legian Bali is a gorgeous Balinese style hotel perfectly situated right on the heart of the beach and every room has the sea view. We stayed there for 10D9N, we were in heaven... The Legian Bali offered not only a Luxurious accommodation, but also a very relaxing environment where we could just lie down on the sunbed facing the sea, went for morning walk at the beach, lie down for a read or went for a swim at the ocean or at the swimming pool. The view was magnificent! Each corner of The Legian Bali was soothing and filled with serene, unruffled tranquility... There was hardly any noise around the hotel and the Zen and calming atmosphere of The Legian Bali relaxed your mind and soul. It was just a really beautiful place to be...

Their Customer Service was tip-top! Balinese are the loveliest people on the planet and each and everyone of them in The Legian always greet the guest with a smile and they always fulfilled the guest's requirement with the best they could. From the reception, concierge, housekeeping, waiters/waitresses to driver, they all have the 5 star service attitude. We have requested for a room change at the beginning of our stay due to the brightness of the room, in return, they upgraded us almost immediately to a brighter room and we couldn't be happier! However, I have to say that regardless of whether it's a studio suite or one-bedroom suite that you stay in, each room is huge and spacious with a lounge room, kitchenette, it's own private balcony and sunbed. The rooms are amazing! And the view is spectacular! Besides the room and the wonderful sea view, The Legian Bali is also located very closely to the shopping area, a short stroll would take you to Seminyak Square and the closeby area for food and shopping. It's an easy access to everywhere else.

And what could I say about the food in The Legian Bali? One Word: AMAZING! Breakfast was a wide selection from Asian to Western, from fruit to sweets. They made beautiful poached eggs! Have it as Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce or Poached eggs with toast, that cannot go wrong. Try any flavor of pancakes, they were all delicious! And the French Toast with strawberries, mascarpone cheese and maple syrup was definitely to die for... So yummy! I love the Asian Congee, Nasi Goreng, Mee Goreng, Balinese Fish, Spicy Chicken etc. Try as much as you could and keep your options open to the morning breakfast. Try as well the Fish n Chips (although it's under Children's menu) for Room Service, OMG! I was really impressed with the battered fresh fish! The batter and the fish were both really fresh! And the chips were really well cooked, it was finger licking good! The portion was definitely good for lunch or snack and for both adult and kids. And I would highly recommend for you to try their dinner. My hubby and I are both foodie and we've almost been to most of the popular restaurants in Seminyak. And I would have to say The Legian Bali restaurant has one of the best technique, taste and presentation for fine dining. I would highly recommend their Chef's Tasting Plate especially if they have the Truffle Ravioli with Mushroom foam and shredded Truffles. It was definitely the most beautiful and delicious dish that cannot be missed! The homemade ravioli that was so thin but so deliciously well cooked, with the amazing flavored mushroom foam topped with dry shredded Truffles, the presentation and flavor of this dish, to us was a Winner!!! The Jamon Iberica (smoked ham) from France was absolutely fantastic! The aged smoked ham thinly sliced and accompanied by a piece of bruschetta, that flavorsome combination was just magnificent. Also, if you LOVE soft shell crab, The Legian Bali has definitely one of the most beautiful Soft Shell Crab made ever... The freshly deep fried Soft Shell Crab with the green in-house recipe butter sauce and top with watercress salad, the incredible combination of the plate absolutely blown me away... That light but flavorsome butter sauce with the fluffy deep fried Soft Shell Crab finished with the refreshing watercress salad, was a speechless combination... I love what came with the 4th course. The Wagyu sirloin with Pan Fried Foie Gras... Droolingly delicious... Also, definitely try their famous Beef Rendang. Such beautifully slow cooked Beef in Rendang sauce, the meat was cooked for hours and they were so flavorsome and tender, each bite you could feel the tendon and the meat beautifully dissolved together. Have them with rice and the chili eggplants, this local dish would leave you lingering around your taste bud with that powerful, beautiful flavor... Last but not least, Dessert... The simple Rasberry Meilleu-Feilleu was unbelivably light and delicious... A beautiful way to end the dinner...

I have read a lot of reviews about restaurants and especially the number one restaurant in Tripadvisor: The Breezes Bali. I could only say I was sooooo disappointed with The Breezes Bali's food, it was a let down for me. There was no chemistry in the food although the presentation was pretty. However, the food was lacking the most vital factor: the unity of food & flavor synchronization... I had really had a better meal in The Legian Bali restaurant, Sarong, La Lucciola, SIP Wine Bar, Mamasan, Metis etc. Each of them to us, was really better than The Breezes Bali. For the price we paid at The Breezes Bali, it was not worth it.
In contrast, that meal that we had at The Legian Bali was a highlight of our trip. We loved food and in The Legian Bali restaurant, we found the chemistry and synchronization between food/flavor... However, I do have to add that the ambience in The Legian Bali was really not as flourish or as beautiful as the Breezes or Sarong or Mamasan etc. It was a simple, open Kitchen concept restaurant with really warm waiters/waitresses and chefs.

In conclusion, we had an amazing trip and staying in The Legian Bali was one of the best choice we've made! We felt the fullness of the trip. It was filled with luxurious, enjoyment and relaxation... We will definitely stay at this beautiful place again, a place that we call Paradise... =)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1682,Probably the most classy hotel in the beach front,50,January 2012,"Spent some 10 days in this hotel and I can recommed it to strongly, even if it is a little pricey.
The rooms and service was smooth and polite, the breakfast amazing. Especially the consierge merits a mention as anything we needed or wanted to do was organized, from golf trips, to surf course, transport and even low-cost restaurant experience.
Especially the fresh fruit provided to the rooms daily made me happy and the discretionary soft drinks were good too.
Legian is classy, with discreet clientele of all types. Location is perfect.
Just a couple of things to bear in mind:
The gym is very small with too limited equipment.
Restaurant (tested only once in the evening) is overpriced for what it is. Not recommended. The luch offering is slightly better but not worth the money.
Bar is relatively expensive, but it helps to keep the random visitors away and hotel area safe and cozy.
Laundry service is very good, although they lost one old T shirt by accident. So just see that you get your stuff back.
(Even if there were noisy kids at the pool, the sea and the waves were so strong that the kids were not disturbing the atmosphere at the pool. )
When I go back to Bali, I will most likely return to Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1683,heaven in bali,50,July 2011,"We have returned for a third visit to this stunning hotel in July -we went with our teenage and adult children(3) and stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. We travelled around to other areas in bali and stayed the last 6 nights at The Legian to end our trip.
As usual this hotel did not disappoint-the rooms and service were impeccable-breakfast is amazing and most days we ate lunch in the pool bar/restaurant-the quality of the food is 5 star and has a huge variety to choose from.
Free wifi throughout the resort was enjoyed by us all-particularly the kids who love their internet and viber on their phones.
The highlight of the resort is the service by the pool by the beautiful staff who put out your towels each day,bring you fresh iced water continually-and the double lounges on the edge of the resort which look onto the beach are hard to beat.
The position of the hotel is perfect-close to seminyak center with all the best shopping ,and close to all the best restaurants in the seminyak area. The concierge is so helpful in making any bookings you need.
I cannot reccomend this hotel highly enough-it may be more expensive than others in the area but definitely worth the extra price-and I cant wait to return-hopefully in July 2012.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1684,The perfect holiday AGAIN!,50,December 2011,"We are usually a bit hesitant to return to the same hotel in a resort area, fearing that the repeat stay will never meet the excellent expectations that were fulfilled the first time. But we were happily rewarded for our bravery. We continue to believe that the Legian is the finest hotel in the Seminyak area, bar none. The attention to detail, great service and fantastic food is simply amazing. We even managed to change our room during the busy holiday season, without a hitch. My husband had booked a Club Villa mistakingly thinking it was on the beach. We arrived late and discovered this error. But Eddie, our butler and the hotel manager quickly changed our reservations and got us into a lovely room at the hotel the very next afternoon. On my birthday, totally unprompted by us, the staff at breakfast appeared at our table with a candlelit cake and a rousing rendition of ""Happy Birthday"". The staff are professional yet friendly and always smiling. We won't hesitate to book another trip in 2012.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1685,Bali Love,50,April 2011,Personal service at a top level. An experience for a lifetime! Picture perfect place where you really have it all in one place.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1686,The Legian Club has spoilt us for any other hotel !!!,50,November 2011,"My husband and I spent 6 nights in the The Club recently and were treated like royalty. Our butler Arisna, was not only extremely attentive, but was able to anticipate the little things that we didnt even realise we wanted until after he took care of them!!! He looked after us beyond the ""call of duty"" and is truly an assett to The Legian! All of the staff are wonderful and nothing was ever too much trouble. My husband even brought the recipe for my favourite cocktail and the Club staff went over and beyond to get the ingredients and perfect the taste!!! What can I say about the villas, service, food, transport at our beck and call, breakfast, the hotel, cocktails, canapes etc etc etc..... WONDERFUL!!!!
Of course, as with all fine and exceptional hotels, it is all of the little things that make your stay special. A small exqample of this involved our 19 year old daughter who joined us for the last 2 nights of our stay...we were going to pick her up from the airport in a Club car...but as we were running a little late, Arisna had checked the flight schedule and decided to send another car ahead of us, just in case she arrived before we got to the airport and had no one to welcome her!
A wonderful stay...we cant wait to go back to this gorgeous home away from home!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1687,"Top notch service, it's the staff that make The Legian 5 star",50,December 2011,"The Legian is truly 5 star. The staff are what make this hotel such a delight to stay at. Always so helpful to assist in anyway, we were always greeted by name and with a warm smile. We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe which was huge - the size of an apartment. Top marks also go to the chefs. The food was divine. Most days were spent lazing on the huge daybeds by the pool, reading a book or watching the ocean. The hotel location is perfect to all the popular restaurants/bars in the area.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1688,Welcome to heaven!,50,December 2011,"We cut short our stay elsewhere in Bali and headed to the serenity of The Legian on the recommendation of a friend. You couldn't prise me out of the hotel - we ate there, slept there and relaxed there. It was fabulous! The staff were pleasant, helpful and unobtrusive. The meals were very good and the room was super-luxurious. It was pricey, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for a special holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1689,"Beautiful place, great value. We regret Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay",50,December 2011,We got an ocean view room. You could hear the water crashing. Soft drinks and water are complimentary as is afternoon tea. The sunsets are way more amazing than Jimbaran bay. This hotel was way nice.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1690,Fantastic!,50,November 2011,Absolutely a great hotel. The breakfast in itself is an experiment. Eggs Benedict are the best I have had.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1691,Wonderful Hotel,50,November 2011,"Stayed here 19th - 26th November 2011.
Checkin: The weather was hot, and the ride in the taxi from the airport was slow. As with the Intercontinental, we were ushered to a lovely seating area and were welcomed with a drink, some refreshing towels, this is such a fantastic first impression. The concierge who took our bags for us, and the chekin clerk were really lovely.
Hotel appearance: Really well maintained, elegant, and tasteful. While we were waiting for our room key we noticed three people with folders paying particular attention to where art and craft work were being placed in the lobby. I'm not sure if they were the artists or hotel management, but a great deal of attention was placed on aesthetics, which sums up our feel of the hotel overall. It is an older building, however it is immaculately maintained and beautifully decorated.
The room: We were upgraded from a deluxe suite to a double room suite, the room was enormous and beautiful. There is only one tv in the living room, and no tv in the bedroom. At first I thought this might be a bit disappointing, but it proved perfect. Complimentary softdrinks and juices in the minibar, free fruit replenished every day, and a sweet treat was left for us in the evening. Every room has an ocean view, and the balcony is large with a daybed, a small table with two chairs, and a wooden clothes airing rack.
Breakfast: Amazing. The buffet was basic, but had everything you could want, and you also had the choice of pancakes, eggs, tomato, spinach, mushrooms, the list goes on, cooked to your taste. I thought this was great because I could avoide the stodge and have an great helathy breakfast every day. The dining room was just wonderful, overlooking an infinity pool, with the ocean waves rolling on to the shore beyond that.
Activities: The hotel offered four free 90 minute yoga sessions each week. It was great. The ocean at the hotel edge is beautiful to swim in too. I usually like to do laps in a pool, but the ocean was far more tempting. I was worried about sharks, and checked with the lifeguard who said in the seven years he'd worked at the hotel, he'd never heard of a shark in the area.
Staff: They were just wonderful. Very helpful, very kind and gentle people. They added to the serene and relaxed atmosphere of the hotel.
Location: Perfect location. My husband and I wanted to do some shopping at Kuta, and we really wanted to work off breakfast, so most days we walked along the beach to Matahari and Discovery Plaze. It takes less than 50 minutes. Then caught a cab back to the hotel for 50,000rhp. There was no shortage of shops, reastaurants and spas very close to the hotel either.
My husband and I really loved this Bali trip, and I think hotel greatly contributed to this. We're already talking about wanting to go back, and also staying for a couple of nights at the Legian's sister hotel in Ubud, the Chedi.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1692,THE LEGIAN lived up to all expectations,50,November 2011,"The Legian is one of those hotels you just have to experience. The rooms are huge, the hotel staff unbelievably efficient and all the ""little""things are taken care of to make your stay just perfect. 2x ipods in your room, afternoon tea by pool or in your room every afternoon, delicious cooked to order breakfast , i-pads on loan in foyer if you dont bring a laptop and complimentary wi fi in room and around hotel .The bar snacks at the pool were delicious.. Absolutely nothing is any trouble to the staff except when asked if we can have a late check out by 2hours. This could not be done which was a real shame as the hotel was not full and it would have made our stay sentational but then having to wait in foyer wasnt that bad.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1693,the best part of our honeymoon,50,September 2011,"there is like 5 staff for every person. They can anticipate everything you need. there is nothing, nothing at all to say that is bad about this place.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1694,"Phenomenal service, great all round hotel",50,June 2011,"Nothing was too much for the staff the Legian. Firstly, as a honeymoon couple we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom luxury suite on arrival which was the size of a large London apartment! Now I'm not one to really use a concierge service that much at a hotel and service in general, whilst important, isn't my highest priority but at the Legian you just couldn't help be impressed by it. They were incredibly helpful with dinner reservations and resolved with ease a potentially highly stressful problem with our return flight home. Service by the pool was equally attentive and you really get the impression that every member of staff is doing their utmost to ensure your stay there is perfect.

As for the place itself, it is without doubt a great hotel but in terms of architecture and atmosphere just not as uniquely special as others in Bali. The hotel is sheltered from the crowds of Seminyak to some degree but you can't quite forget you're close to a very busy resort town. Clientele can be very varied too, yes you get the beautiful trendy young couples but also the families and slightly uncouth middle-aged westerners.

Breakfast however is superb and the free ice-cream by the pool a great touch. So if visiting Seminyak I would definitely recommend the Legian and for what it is, a famous hotel for all, then I really can't fault it. However, just make sure you dig a little deeper into Bali and also stay at one of the fantastic boutique hotels away from this part of the island.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1695,Practically perfect in every way,50,November 2011,"We stayed at the Legian Bali for a week at the beginning of November 2011. Our stay could not have been more lovely. I had called beforehand to let the hotel know that I would be 6 months pregnant, as I did not want to have to walk too far from our room in the heat (Bali is rather humid in November). Upon arrival we were seated in the comfortable lounge area and provided with drinks while the staff checked us in and informed us that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a (huge!) suite. The week just got better from there... All the staff were always so helpful and kind, it felt as if nothing was too much trouble. The hotel design is elegant and understated - dark woods match crisp white walls and beautiful, simple artwork complement without dominating. There is complimentary afternoon tea by the pool each day, water and soft drinks in the mini-bar are complimentary, wifi throughout the hotel is complimentary - and probably lots more I can't remember!

If there had to be a weaker spot, it would be the food. It was good, but for the prices (not expensive by Western standards, but at the top end for Seminyak) it never quite reached the heights that the rest of our stay at the Legian acheived - having said that, it is hard to compete with all the fantastic restaurants in Seminyak so maybe we were a little spoilt!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1696,Always 5 Star,40,October 2011,"We stayed at the Legian with our 5 month old and nothing was too much trouble. They had set up a cot with mosquito net and not just a portacot but a proper one, provided a bottle steriliser, baby bath and highchair, all free of charge. We had to hire these items at the other hotel we stayed at so this was a nice addition.

The deluxe room gives you lots of space which was great with a little one. They service your room twice daily & replace towels etc which is fantastic. Free soft drinks in the minibar and plenty of water supplied for drinking and brushing your teeth. The breakfasts are great and we had it on our villa balcony everyday.

The only things to fault was the Nasi Goreng I ordered wasn't very authentic and had spicy crispy/fried chicken (looked & tasted like KFC hot & spicy) on the side which I've never seen in a nasi goreng before. The other issue was that the earthquake happened while we were there & there was no action plan. We were quite worried at the time and ran outside the builing, but the staff didn't know what to do we were worried that it might have triggered a tsunami & with a 5 month old it was pretty scary, but they were all laughing & no-one even spoke to us.

Apart from that, the pool is great & staff are very friendly & I would recommend this first class accommodation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1697,Do we have to leave?,50,November 2011,"We stayed for 5 nights in a deluxe suite and cannot fault this hotel. The staff are so helpful and remember your name. Great buffet breakfast with western and asian food ( if you are Aussie they even have Vegemite). Complimentary soft drinks in minibar, Bluray library, complimentary afternoon tea,shuttle to Jl Seminyak, all rooms face the ocean,sandals and beach bag provided I want to live here!
We did have a problem with our A/C in the bedroom but was fixed in ten minutes.
Will definitely come back",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1698,Loved it,50,September 2011,"Stayed for 6 nights and wished we could have stayed longer. Everything from location, pool,bar,staff, service was excellent. Buffet breakfast was superb. We'd go back straight away if we could",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1699,A true 5 star hotel.,50,October 2011,"Everything went really well from beginning to end. Large suite, good service, excellent included breakfast.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1700,"Great service, fabulous location",40,October 2011,"A good mini-bar, comfortable beds, attractive rooms, the sound of the waves in your room -- they're everywhere. What makes a good hotel great? Staff, staff, staff. The Legian has been a fixture on this beach for 15 years or so, and I'll bet most of the staff have been there since the first day. They are warm and welcoming, and take great enjoyment from having happy clients in their ""home"". Good management that empowers them to be creative is essential -- this is not the kind of service a manager can simply command. Overall, it is very impressive.

On the other hand, there are always a few things ... The iPods in the rooms contain a huge stock of albums, but would greatly benefit from a selection of well-composed playlists -- when I go on holiday, I don't want to wade through Metallica and Burt Bacharach, I just want to choose a good jazz playlist. Next, the in-room decor could use a critical eye. The giant shells were impressive 15 years ago, but today we are reminded that these are endangered species and most are probably on the CITES list for banned trade. And how about certification as an officially green hotel? That would REALLY make clients happy.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1701,club @ the legian - best hotel we have ever stayed at !!!!!!,50,October 2011,"we stayed here after 4 nights at the amazing GHM Chedi Ubud. We thought that that hotel could not be beaten but how wrong we were .

how this hotel isnt at the top of tripadvisor i do not know. elegant luxury . gorgeous grounds , beach , pools etc etc

we stayed at the club across the road for 4 nights in a pool villa. you get between the hotel and the club by spending about 1 minute travelling by golf cart! i thought the villas at chedi where amazing but they blew even those away. amazing butler called Sura . the great thing about the Legian Club is your butler only works for you - so is always there for you.

just absolutely amazing. service. spa . restaurants . afternoon tea at the villa . free cocktails. my local newspaper from the UK brought to our room every day.

any questions - Sura had an answer. where to get handbags ? where to eat ? where to get authentic Bali souvenirs ? Sura had an answer and a car waiting to take us there!
the list is endless

amazing amazing amazing - truely a leading hotel of the world
we met the assistant manager at a cocktail night and had a note from the manager on arrival and an email after. brilliant service.

we were treated like VIPs from start to finish thanks to the level of service at the hotel and being on honeymoon and booking through the legendary travel agent David Ourisman all helped!

stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels in europe and usa and this was the best",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1702,Excellent Hotel,50,October 2011,"The Legian is an excellent hotel. The staff are friendly, helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, it is spacious and clean, there is a turndown service each night and the small treats that are left is a nice touch. The mini bar is well stocked and the soft drinks and water is free. The spa treatments are lovely and well worth a treat. The Hotel meals are a little expensive and be aware that alcohol is extremely expensive, a bottle of wine can cost up to £50, however, all that said, the meals are very good. There is a wide range of restaurants outside of the Hotel, we went to Hard rock cafe in Kuta and also Chandi in Seminyak, both restaurants provided value for money and the meals were lovely. There are beach sellers, but if you politely say 'no thank you' they will not bother you. When you arrive at the airport, be aware of the porters as they will offer to help with your case and then escort you to the money exchange bureau, you need not pay anymore than 5000 rupees per case.
Remember to take your mosquitto repellent as you will most certainly be bitten at night. We had a good holiday and will certainly stay at other GHM hotels.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1703,"Great Hotel, Club Disappointed",40,September 2011,"We stayed at the club in one bedroom Villa. The Villa was of good size, luxurious and the free mini bar was generous .We had a private butler which was trying his best to give the best service. However we expected him to be more knowledgeable of the area, dining options and shopping options. his English was OK but in times we couldn't understand each other. some amenities expected in a basic hotel bathroom were not there. We love staying in luxurious places but we didn't feel the club here worth the money. the rooms at the hotel will be of much greater value.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1704,The Club - A Real 5/5 - Genuinely Brilliant,50,September 2011,"Stayed for 4 nights as part of an extended honeymoon in Indonesia/SE Asia.

Had a villa at The Club. Having flitted between the hotel and the Club area constantly, I can honestly say The Club has a distinct edge (as you can spend as much time at the hotel as you like, but then retreat to your villa). Having breakfast at The Club was a no-brainer as they have their own kitchen and staff - we only saw 2 other couples the entire time, whereas the buffet in the main hotel was rammed.

Great butler (Putu) - a genuinely sweet natured man who couldn't have wanted to help us more than he did. His patience with my constant demands for ice, vodka and chopped limes was heroic! (the complimentary bar is the best I've ever seen)

The ipods have a lot of good music from Kylie to classic punk like The Misfits.

The pool at The Club is 35M and rarely has anyone in it or by it - it's yours effectively. The pool in the villas is also sizeable and perfect for a cool-off dip or a drunken naked divebomb at midnight!

The bed is smaller then you expect, but the interior of the villa is so cool, it really doesn't matter.

6 pieces of laundry per person are included - this was an unexpected perk having arrived with loads of dirty clothes.

Dinner over the road at The Legian is quiet and relaxing with the waves crashing down on the beach. Service was spot on and the Indonesian food very good. The special ice cream bowls also are worthy of a mention (they have an inner bowl with crushed ice to stop the ice cream melting - ingenious.

Spa - excellent. The massages were very good.

Communal areas of the hotel - excellent...a very cool layout and design - very tasteful.

Overall one of best hotels I've ever stayed at. Recommended unreservedly.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1705,Beautiful hotel with amazing service,50,September 2011,"Amazing hotel with attentive, friendly and helpful staff. We plan on going back to Bali in the next couple of years and will definitley include a stay at The Legian as part of the trip!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1706,Great stay at beautiful property,50,September 2011,"You can't beat the beach view at the Legian, especially at sunset. The hotel is beautiful and the entire property well designed. We stayed in a pool villa at the club and cannot say enough about the service and dedication of the staff. They remembered every preference and made sure we were well attended to. The only downside of the club is that the villas do not have sea view but the private pool is a great place to unwind in the chaos of Seminyak.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1707,Absolutely perfect!!,50,September 2011,"We've just returned from an amazing honeymoon which included a week stay at the Legian and what can I say, it was just perfect! It is a very elegant and traditional hotel with a wonderful relaxed feel as soon as you enter. The smell of the beautiful flowers is very noticable too:-) The staff were all lovely, always smiling, always very welcoming and nothing too much trouble. The concierge and reception service was very efficient and helpful. The room we had was amazing and huge. We had a dining area, a lounge area, a large balcony with a day bed and table/chairs, a beautiful bedroom with a 4 poster bed and netting that was pulled to at night when they turned the bed down. The bathroom was huge too with 2 washbasins, a large bath, sep walk in shower and separate wc. Breakfast was extensive with a local option, and the full range you would expect from a top hotel and again the service excellent and prompt. We didn't have dinner while we were there as we wanted to eat out, but we did have lunch a few times and the food again was excellent! Complimentary afternoon tea each day was also a lovely touch! The pool area is lovely and the position of the hotel is right by the sea! Each day your provided with sun lotion, cold/wet flannels and a glass of iced water which was constantly topped up or refreshed during the day...just what you need in the heat! The sea isn't gentle, the waves do crash but they're excellent fun especially if you get a boogie board and ride a few waves! The sound of the ocean is something we've come back with in our minds....very relaxing! A few final things to mention...the spa is excellent and a balinese massage really sorts those knots out! You also get a bag in your room to use for the pool/beach was is handy to know as I wouldn't have taken one if I'd known. If your going out for food try Ultimo, we went twice and had an excellent meal both times:-) Note that wine is expensive no matter where you go, it's due to the high import taxes. We tried a local red, Two Islands which was good. As you can imagine we really didn't want to leave and I would go back to the Legian tomorrow!! We will definately be back!!:-)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1708,Bliss in Bali,50,September 2011,"This place feels like home. The room was so spacious and had all the creature comforts you expect. But above all what makes this place so fantastic is the staff. Denis, pool concierge took very good care of me. I was travelling on my own and she made sure I had plenty of magazines and drinks. At the Spa the ladies are all so professional and kind. The Balinese massage is the perfect way to start a holiday, really gets you relaxed and ready to enjoy the sunshine. And you can enjoy walks on the beach without being harrased by any vendors :)

Highly recommend waking up for breakfast and having the omelette and french toast (best!).

The surrounding area of Seminyak has lots of cute boutiques and good bars like Ku de Ta and Potato Head.

I'm really looking forward to going back some day",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1709,Just fabulous.......again!!!,50,September 2011,"We are regulars - every 12 months for 2 weeks. We start our holidays in Bali by visiting and staying elsewhere - this time in Ubud and then completing our holiday at ""the Legian"". the service is brilliant...nothing is too much and you never have to wait. Breakfast is the best...huge selection and always delicious, Best pool with the best ocean view. Rooms are awesome...very spacious.
Only criticism....NO FOXTEL.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1710,Perfect - and I never thought I would say that,50,September 2011,"I suppose others may find fault (maybe for them the bed is too soft or too hard) but for me The Legian was perfect and in over 75 reviews on tripadvisor I have never said that before and never thought I would.
We stayed 5 nights and wished we had stayed more. The 1 bed suite had a massive bathroom with walk in shower, two sinks, enormous bath and seperate toilet. The large balcony had a day bed and other furniture and the room included a guest toilet, small kitchenette, free soft drinks, free wifi.
The breakfast buffet was extensive and well cooked omlettes, waffles etc on request.
Great service, a good gym and spa, free afternoon tea and the most beautiful sunset every night.
Seminyak itself is a small town with a number of very good restaurants (Metis, Sardine, Sarong, Ku Da Te, Gado Gado) and is far enough away from Kuta to avoid that hellhole.
My only complaint - The Legian is too far from London!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1711,The Cub - Best in Bali,50,August 2011,"I stayed at the Club in Villa 5 for 5 nights.

I did not expect such a cosy, chilled out and private villa with garden and pool. Everything was been taken care of. The butlers name was Bona - He is highly recommendable as he is caring, intuitive and well understandable. Great guy!

The drinks in the Villa are for free and refilled every day including Beer, Vodka, Whisky and Gin which considering the generally high alcohol prices is a real feel on the wallet. Cocktails in the Club are for free from 6-8pm.

The Best out of 4 hotels that I stayed at (St Regis, The Club-Legian, Chedi Club and Maya Ubud)

Highly recommendable",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1712,Best ocean views,50,July 2011,"We stayed at The Legian for three nights and simply loved it. The rooms are huge, gorgeous, and have stunning ocean views. It was lovely to fall asleep to the crashing of the waves. The breakfast buffet was amazing (the french toast was the best I've ever had). The staff were wonderful. Although this hotel is expensive, they don't nickel and dime you like many fancy resorts. Most items in the mini-bar are free, there is complimentary afternoon tea, yummy snacks left in your room at night, free wireless, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Legian and would definitely stay here again if we returned to Seminyak. The only downside was that the beach was not as nice as I expected (and there are two unknown water sources running into the beach that smelled dodgy).",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1713,Stunning!!,50,July 2011,"This was our third stay at the Legian in 6 years. We are reasonably frequent travellers to Bali - 6 times in 6 years - and enjoy experiencing different hotels and villas, but without doubt The Legian is our favourite destination probably anywhere in the world. There's really only one word to describe it, and that's exceptional in every way.
The rooms are understated, large, and quiet, with large balconies. The staff without exception are wonderful but non-intrusive. The views over the Indian Ocean are magnificent The breakfasts are first class. We don't usually eat other meals within hotels, preferring local restaurants, but had dinner last night prior to our flight home and it was wonderful, with an ambience to die for!
Our only ""criticism"" to the staff on our last day was that the bed was very firm and the feather pillows not our choice, (very similiar to most beds we've had in Indonesia) and were informed that they will easily supply a pillow-top mattress and pillow menu on request. I know what we'll be requesting next time round!
We can't wait to get back - it's a magnificent, but reasonably expensive, holiday - but well worth it.
We've tried the rest, and will keep going back to the best.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1714,A great all round hotel experience in Bali,50,July 2011,"The Legian Hotel in Seminyak offers a great all round experience. The hotel itself is ideally positioned, offers a wide range of suites to meet virtually all needs and provides a very high level of service.

From the moment you arrive, having taken advantage of priority visa clearance at the airport and enjoyed seemless travel to the hotel, the staff make you feel welcome and comfortable immediately.

The reception staff give you a tour of the hotel which allows you to feel at home as soon as you arrive. It also allows you to understand and appreciate all the hotel amenities so that you can take full advantage of them right from the start.

The rooms are large and very well equipped with modern technology (TV, Blue Ray DVD, and IPod equipment). The rooms have small kitchens which in particular offers families additional benefits. The rooms all have balconies overlooking the sea and gardens which are delightful.

The hotel is situated on Jalan Oberoi in the centre of Seminyak and is surrounded by a wide selection of shops, restaurants and bars. Despite its proximity to so such retail therapy it sits behind high walls and is completely private with total security. The hotel has absolute beachfront access onto the ocean and the lifeguards are both helpful and attentive to all your possible needs including surf and boggy boards and advice as to the best place to swim.

The hotel restaurants are exceptional. The beach bars offers cocktails, drinks and a wide range of high quality food all day long. The two beach bars are surrounded by the beachfront and manicured gardens with a large amount of sun loungers and daybeds. The main restaurant is open for breakfast lunch and dinner and combines great food with efficient and understated service which makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. The staff were at all times friendly and attentive.

For us, the quality of service stood out as exceptional and in particular the lifeguards supervised and helped our young child to surf and enjoy the beach safely. Our only minor criticism was the hot water system which was a little inconsistent but this was a tiny flaw in an otherwise great experience.

We look forward to returning to the Legian Hotel Bali in the near future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1715,Fantastic place - hope to go back asap,50,July 2011,"This was our first trip to Seminyak so were uncertain of what to expect.

The Legian surpassed our expectations on nearly every score. This is a truly first class 5 star establishment. Some ""5 star"" hotels seem to have gone through a check list of what is required to get the 5 stars but miss out on offering any real experience. The Legian has all the necessary facilities but more importantly it offers a real 5 star experience, from the quality and number of the staff to the personal touches and intimacy of the place. The atmosphere was great, it was buzzy without being overly busy, the food and all the bars excellent, the pool and beach front are awesome, some of the best in seminyak, and its location is great with ku de ta 5 minutes walk in one direction on the beach and la lucciola and potatohead are 5 and 10 minute walk the other way.

Our room was lovely with great ocean views and views over the pool. We were nearly always referred to by name which i found astonishing, the staff were falling over each other to help us. One touch which I loved was that they not only organised a car to take us to the airport, but once at the airport there was a member of staff in Legian uniform who took our bags and checked them in and guided us to the check in and passport control. Truly surpassing my expectations. If we had been more organised then they would have taken car of all check in and we could have gone straight to the passport control an hour later!

As for Seminyak itself, it is a very buzzy and busy part of bali, but even tho it has the great hotels and bars and a big beach, it is still bali and the roads and infrastructure are not western standards. Its worth heading down towards the Kuta end of the beach as it gets much more busy and clubby down there which is fun to experience.

All in all a brilliant hotel and I would say maybe the best I have ever visited.

NB: we were on honeymoon and it was perfect.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1716,Wonderful stay,50,July 2011,"Really hard to find fault with this fantastic resort. Nothing is too difficult for any of the staff; facilities (pool, spa, gym, restaurants) are all of a very high standard; location is amazing, right on the beachfront and a short walk to shops and restaurants.

The room was immaculate, great bed and bathroom, plus kitchen facilities that included complementary soft drinks, juices and water. Also make sure to enjoy the complementary gelato offered poolside each afternoon!

Staff were unfailingly pleasant and friendly, but still managed to be quite unobtrusive - they were quick to make themselves available to assist, but otherwise were busy with their work and would leave you to it.

Travelling solo in a resort full of families and couples can be uncomfortable and often you tend to fade into the background, but again the staff went out of their way to provide the same level of service to me as to everyone else.

You can walk down a couple of steps to be right on the beach, or remain on the sun loungers and sun beds on a grassed area. Everyone out there is provided with water and sunscreen lotion which I thought wasa really nice touch.

This resort is not cheap, but I felt happy to pay the premium given the level of service and the options. Highly, highly recommended!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1717,Tightly run dame,40,July 2011,"Traditional grand hotel with amazingly helpful and charming staff. Very happy with our spacious and calm rooms. Breakfast delicious and all food of high standard. The atmosphere is sedate, so not so good for party animals (try The W instead - James Bond on ice). Concierge service most helpful and efficient. Guess my only negative comment would be that the decor is a little dated but everything is very clean and well maintained. What's not to love?",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1718,Fabulous hotel in the best part of Seminyak. Look no further!,50,June 2011,"If you enjoy peace and relaxation, spacious guestrooms and suites,than take advantage of Legian's elegant beachside accommodations. My boyfriend and I stayed at The Legian this June and what can I say....the place is the ideal lodging option for romantic getaways and family vacations. I can go on and on for hours about hotel amenities,but I will put it in one word- luxury. The service was impeccable from start to finish. We were offered a VIP airport pick up, which we agreed on and were ever grateful we did. We were picked up wright from the gate and had the smoothest visa/immigration and luggage reclaim process, had a nice ride and were welcomed at the check in despite the fact of a late night it was 2 a.m. The beach part is very important when you travel to such countries like Bali. I was pleasantly surprised to find it very quiet. It was barely anyone, just a few people walking. Also the infinity effect of the pool makes you feel like you are bathing in the sea...so amazing. The location of the hotel is perfect itself, I think. It is far enough from the noisy busy shopping area in Seminyak(still walking distance) , but steps away from some of the nicest restaurants like La Luciola and Ku De Ta. Plus you get a ride to town or cafe wright from the hotel. We used local restaurant for lunch almost everyday and a couple of times for dinner and it was great. The delicious breakfast was included . It is definitely a five star hotel. Smiles all around. We stayed at The Legian for a week and were sad to leave.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1719,Overrated...,30,June 2011,"There are now plenty of other resorts in the Seminyak area that offer great service and newer/ fresher decor for a similar price.
This hotel is approx. 14 years old and in need of refurbishment. The service was ok but not of a 5 star standard. This was my 6th stay in Bali and I would not recommend it nor return to The Legian until they have completed a renovation...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1720,Sheer luxury,50,May 2011,"We have been fortunate to stay in many 5 star hotels all over the world, but this hotel would rank #1. The rooms are perfect, well appointed, very clean and quiet. The staff can't do enough for you and the breakfast is incredible. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxation and a bit of pampering. We heard that the rooms are renovated annually, so you get old world luxury with a fresh, modern feel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1721,A wonderful stay,50,May 2011,"My new husband and I stayed here on the first stop of four places in Bali for our honeymoon. We stayed at one of the villas at The Club at the Legian, and were blown away by how amazing the accommodations and service were. The villa is huge with a living room, bedroom, huge bathroom inside, and then lots of sitting areas outside around the pool, and an outside bathtub. The pool is quite large. The food was amazing, and our butler, Bona, was fantastic. Literally everything you could possibly want (and then some) is offered to you there. The minibar is complimentary with teas, coffee, a few spirits, water, snacks etc. The food is excellent and we loved having breakfast daily in our room. The trip across the road to The Legian is offered by buggie and takes about a minute. The beach / pool chairs there are plentiful and when we were there, it was relaxing and not crowded. The area is great and while it was cloudy in the evenings while we were there, you can see the amazing Bali sunsets without having to face the crowds of Ku de Ta. We are very glad that we selected the Club over the hotel as the intimacy and accommodations in the villa (plus the private pool) were well worth the minute travel to the beach.

As a whole (and this is no fault at all of the hotels), we didnt love the Seminyak / Legian area. It just didnt have any soul...meaning it was very western, very touristy, and lacking in feeling particularly Balinese. Traffic in the area is awful, so much that we actually cancelled one day of our tours as we just couldnt face it again. Had we known, we would have skipped this area of Bali entirely as the rest of the island is so much more beautiful and peaceful, but if we found ourselves having to stay in this area again, we'd rush to the Club at the Legian. If you are debating whether this area of Bali is for you, I'd err on the side of no.

Truly top notch hotel..cant think of a single thing they could have done better. and i'm picky!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1722,Bali Paradise,50,September 2010,"I love the Legian hotel. We have stay here 5 times now over the last 4 years. Each time it is a very special place. The staff are first class, the facilities are world standard. The rooms are luxurious and large, the views are incredible. I particularly like the daily lunch special and the omelette for breakfast. It is a short walk or drive to many of Seminyaks restaurants and other attractions. The fact the beach is rough does not worry us as the pool at the Legian is terrific and right on the beach. We are going back in September, cant wait.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1723,Wow!!,50,June 2011,"Our holiday was perfect in every way, thanks to the wonderful staff at The Legian. The service was impeccable, the breakfast divine, the pool and lounges are fantastic, the view is magnificent, what can i say - but I can't wait to come back !!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1724,Expectations exceeded,50,May 2011,"After one disappointing night in a Sanur hotel, our amazing experience at The Legian's sister hotel Chedi Club in Ubud made us decide to gonfor quality and choose The Legian for the rest of stay. We figured, being 3-4 times the scale of Chedi Club in no. of rooms, it would be good but perhaps not great. Well, it was more than great. Welcomed by name, given a wonderful ground floor suite with unbelievable facilities such as Bose soundsystems and two fully stuffed iPods, and with every single staff member doing their very best to make us comfortable.

Everything this hotel offers is top quality, as every review seems to confirm. But most notable is the personal attention we experienced. The hotel manager, Carla, the restaurant manager Chendra, all would stop by every now and then to see how we were enjoying our stay. We were even invited to a cocktail party at the Legian Beach House, and were given a wonderful tour of this exclusive 6 guest top notch accommodation. Something to remember for our next wedding anniversary!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1725,Splendid experience on every level,50,May 2011,"The Legian is just one of the best places I have ever stayed, and l loved every single moment of being there.
It is like staying in a big comfy mansion, a home where nothing is too much trouble for the amazing staff. I cannot thank them enough for looking after me so well. As a solo traveller I really appreciated the way I was treated at meals where not once did I feel uncomfortable or odd for dining alone, but rather delighted at the care and friendliness.
The hotel is close to all the attractions of Seminyak and walking distance to great little massage boutiques around the area, a favourite pastime of mine while in Bali.
It is the pool though and those comfortable day beds looking out at endless breaking waves that are the highlight of the place. You could (and I did spend a whole day in total bliss shaded by coconut palms and the most attentive pool staff I ever encountered. STUNNING!!
My room was awesome with incredible views of the pool, the gardens and most importantly the sunset into the ocean. Nothing lacked, and all my senses were totally catered for with little touches like incense cones and an ipod set with soft music to lull me into dreams of tropical paradise. Good part is I would wake in the morning knowing I had yet another day to spend there.
The restaurant food is to die for, breakfast, lunch and dinner, and even though there are a ton of good places around the area it was very easy just to eat in knowing the food would be excellent.
I will visit there again. Perfect for time out, very classy but with a relaxed non pretentious environment, The Legian has won my heart.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1726,Couldnt fault it,50,May 2011,"We have just returned from 10 days at The Legian. We travel a lot all around the world and have very high standards. We normally stay at the Four Seasons hotels however we went with a big group so thought that this would work out better. We were right! I went with wife, help and twin infant babies and my mum and grandma were in a seperate suite. The suites are HUGE. There are many ""little touches"" that are great. Such as 2 ipods filled with great music that one can use freely whilst in the resort. Little notes left on pillow each night. Complimentary afternoon Tea and Snacks served betwen 4-6pm. All complimentary soft drinks replensihed daily in suites; These are all very nice touches and paying the amount the one does to stay there, one would expect this however most resorts of this calibre still charge for this.
What made the stay even more pleasurable was the nature of the staff. From the people who make up your room and work in the grounds right up to the AGM - Didier who we spoke with several times.
Everyone addressed us by our name. Even people who I swear had never seen me before, knew our names. They went out of their way to make one feel welcome. The food was also great. We ate breakfast and lunch in the hotel every day and also had room service and a beach Seafood BBQ. All of the meals were great!
We would definately go back to the Legian and I couldn't recommend it highly enough",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1727,Superb hotel!!!!!,40,May 2011,"Sometimes its the management and staff running a hotel which makes all the difference, and this is the case with The Legian. Physically the hotel itself is very nice with large well appointed rooms ( so large the light switches are a bugger to find), large well kept grounds and pool, nice hip ing the has been well looked after, although the styling has an older robust feel, rather than some more contemporary hotels, and this seems to suit the target clientele.

The staff and management of the hotel are fantastic, as other reviews have pointed out they are helpful friendly and know your surname even though we only stayed 3 nights. Our departing flight was at midnight and checkoutform the hotel was at 12noon, but they have a spare suite for guests to use (1hour bookings) at no cost plus we were able to stay at the hotel (luggage in storage) all day and use the facilities. We spent the day by the beach and boogie boarding before watching the sunset, using the courtesy suite and leaving for the airport. We oveheard others who had been at the airport since midday, so this service made all the difference.

Ignore the bad review, the rooms are fully equipped and the tv is in the living room not the bedroom, you should get up to watch and why would anyone go to Bali to watch tv anyway!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1728,Dream come true,50,May 2011,"The reason what makes this hotel so fabulous is the extremely helpful and friendly staff. We have been here for five days and have had the most splendid time. Our room is perfect, ample space inside, tastefully furnished, views direct out onto the sea and a bed to die for. The Spa is also definitely worth a visit. Each masseur has learnt each massage for three months before they can practice and they are heavenly. The Tibetan Hot Stone massage is highly recommended. Ignore the review of the person who wrote such disparaging remarks. None of it is true. I could not recommend the Legian more highly.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1729,Magnifient Hotel in a Class by Itself,50,March 2011,"Absolutely stunning room and view with two balconies. They have thought of everything and then some. Very friendly staff always willing to help. Hotel is expensive but worth the cost for special stay. Much of staff welcomed me by name by second day. Beach is lovely to look at but rough while we were there. Not much beach at high tide but very wide at low tide as it is almost flat. Great theme suppers. Suggest you walk up beach to next hotel ( under construction) for a wonderful beachfront dinner. Not much in the immediate neighbourhood besides a variety store. Taxi needed to go into town unless you like a walk on fairly poor street. Significant security at the hotel. Free soft drinks in room bar, ice delivered every afternoon, twice a day room clean with fresh towels each time. Sun tan lotion and ice water brought to pool lounges.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1730,Outstanding hotel!,50,March 2011,"We stayed for three nights at the Legian and everything was perfect. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was awesome: large, comfortable, all kind of amenities. We didn't like Seminyak that much so we spent most of our time in the hotel, at the beach, pool, bar or restaurant. The staff was friendly and helpful - on our day of departure we got a late check out at 7pm. Overall a great stay.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1731,WONDERFUL HOTEL AND STAFF,50,March 2011,"Well, you can ignore the review below from who seems to be a serial complainer. I was there at the same time as this person and experienced none of the negative points he raises. This hotel is in a great position in the north of Seminyak away from the hordes but close enough to the action if you need it. The beach is clean and has wonderful surf to jump around and body-board in. The hotel has more of a members-club/boutique feel to it, especially when atmospeherically lit at night. Rooms are huge: the one-bedroom suite we had was 110 sq m PLUS the large terravce outside. They are stylishly decorated in subtle neutral colour schemes with all mod cons including some nice touches like Bose I-pod docks.
The pool area is lovely with a tiered swimming pool leading down to the beach and very comfy day-beds elevated up from the beach.
But, the best thing about the hotel, apart from the rooms, is the service. It is second to none, Everyone, from the pool-attendants constantly refilling your water glasses and checking you are ok to the wonderful General Manager, Carla, is striving to ensure your stay is as special as possible.
One small criticism...the bar-tender at the pool-bar could mabe fine-tune his cocktail making skills, especially at their prices!
Overall a great hotel for anyone from romantic couples to young families.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1732,If you want an old tired run-down hotel next to a construction site - stay here!!!,10,March 2011,"I don'y know where the other people have stayed that reviewed this previously. Maybe they have never been in a five-star hotel but my experience with this place is horrible.
The hotel is old and is in disrepair for a supposed 5-star hotel
The first room I was allocated was located adjacent to a construction site
The second room offered was still next to the construction
The third room offered was not satisfactory
The furniture is old
No amenities are offered in the room
The balcony has no lights so we cannot use it at night
The bath overflow was not working - the bath tub overflowed onto the bathroom floor - the bathroom floor had no drain.
The bed is small
No TV in the bedroom
The AC not working properly
Food that we ordered was not good - for a sandwich the bread was stale
The towels and bed linen are old and grey rather than white.

The pictures shown for this hotel on its website and the description of the hotel and its facilities are misleading.

This hotel has spoilt my trip to Bali. It is by far and away the worst value for money for any hotel that I have ever stayed in.

As it is late at night here we will stay one night but will check out in the morning and find a proper hotel.

I believe that the Legian should be removed from your site as it is in no way a leading hotel in anything except deception.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1733,Paradise,50,March 2011,"Loved the location, the hotel, the service and just the small touches that completed my experience there...

The staff were friendly and nothing was too small for them to attend to. I had an issue with the air conditioning as it was getting too hot in the evenings when it came time to sleep and I only mentioned it casually thinking I was just having hot flashes but after further investigations, they found a fault. They fixed it and I slept better on the 3rd night.

Comfy beddings, good shower pressure.... great view from my balcony. I did not have to leave it to view Bali's sunset... I just sat with a drink in hand.

I would suggest not leaving the hotel altogether as it could be a lovely honeymoon or a great romantic getaway for couples.... I look forward to bringing my husband there in the future.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1734,Very Impressive,50,December 2010,The location is perfect. The rooms are spacious and all have views of the ocean. Fresh exotic fruit was placed in the room every night. The staff and concierge were amazing and on top of every restaurant reservation and every excursion. Eva Air cancelled my return flight and the concierge was in constant contact with Eva Air and China Air until the situation was resolved. You can rent a private car for 8 hours to Ubud for around $130USD. The complementary breakfast was very good and the croissants were actually better than most places in LA or NY. Very impressive indeed.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1735,You get what you pay for.,50,January 2011,"The Legian in Seminyak is expensive for Bali and totally worth every Rupiah. The staff are attentive, the rooms are enormous and fabulous and the position and amenities excellent. We spent three happy days here enjoying the ocean, the pool, the food, the complementary afternoon tea under the pavilion, quite sheltered from the hurly burly outside the gates. We were caught up in the flight delays because of the volcano eruption and had to return to The Legian twice from the airport. Both times we were met by name with a smile and the keys to the rooms we had just vacated. The concierge staff managed to talk to airport staff when we couldn't and were extraordinarily efficient and helpful. Would give an unqualified recommendation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1736,I love just everything about it,50,March 2010,"As a girl, i really love doing spa and the spa in this hotel was great. I had a great time with the spa. It was the greatest out there. I was also amazing had a dinner while watching the beach. It was really worth paying actually",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1737,definitely the best place to stay in seminyak,50,January 2011,"The service is amazingly well trained, they call you on your name from the first day. They know after a breakfast what you like and how you like it to be prepared. When I got the Bali Belly in a club, they sent me nurse, everybody was taking care and ask my partner how I am.
This hotel has amazing garden with beach, and service all day long. They want you feel happy and just relaxed. Friendly, professional. I simply recommend with any case...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1738,And I'm fussy.....,50,January 2011,"Yes I am fussy, I will admit. The legian is AMAZING! The staff, the food, the rooms!! You are totally away from the busy dirty areas, it's almost like the legian is an island itself. The ONLY negative comment I have is.... Bad bad bathroom products, I have travelled the world, stayed in some amazing places and always had decent bathroom products, so this quick 7 day trip, I left my usual shampoo conditioner etc at home, soooo wish I didn't, and can't really buy any quality hair card products. I know to most men this would sound trivial, but to a chemically treated long blonde hair girl, this can make or break z holiday!! Xx",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1739,My favorite hotel,50,May 2010,"I have stayed at this hotel three times. Twice in May 2006 and again in June 2008. I have been meaning to write a review for years but it's difficult to find the words. From the moment you receive your welcome drink you know you are in an unusually indulgent paradise. All senses are stimulated here by the beautiful rooms, location, attentive staff and delicious food. After our first visit, we canceled our reservations at a different hotel, and after a trip to Borneo we came back to the Legian and were greeted like long lost family members. Two years later, I received the same welcome upon my return.

If you are hesitating about whether to stay here -- don't. All these years and many travels later, the Legian is still my favorite hotel experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1740,The spa was fantastic,50,January 2011,I did not stay here but did use the spa and it was fantastic. 2 hour massage was worth the $150 AUD it cost. For 250000 IDR you can use the pool and gym all day - totally worth it. Although they are not very good at making cocktails. I ordered a frozen lychee martini and they could not do it at all it tasted watery and was not very nice.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1741,Bliss,50,June 2010,We stayed at The Legian for 9 nights in June 2010. The service was amazing and the location perfect. We were travelling with a two year old and another family with two children. Despite the fact that there isnt a kids club it wasnt a major problem. Although if we had of been on our own it would have been hard constantly entertaining our little boy. The breakfasts are the best of any hotel I have ever stayed and the rooms are ideal.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1742,beautiful hotel,50,October 2010,"This is a beautiful and serene hotel. The view of the ocean from the infinity pools, dining room and bar is amazing. The water was rough, but the beach in front of the hotel is well maintained. The beach chairs are wonderful and relaxing. The gym was nice, but small. The food was great and there was tons of variety for breakfast. The staff is very helpful and as you would expect from people on Bali, extremely pleasant and lovely. The room itself was huge and the bed was quite comfortable. The bathroom was huge and very nice, as well.
If I recall correctly, there is a resort being built next door. I never heard construction noise early in the morning or in the evening. Nor could I hear construction noise while relaxing near the beach.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1743,Highly Recommended,50,November 2010,"My partner and I (early 40’s Australians) stayed at The Legian Seminyak from 12 to 21 November 2010 in a one bedroom suite. Lonely Planet (probably not the best guide to high end accommodation I’ll concede) describes The Legian as “brash and flash” in a somewhat pejorative tone, this is (now) inaccurate, halcyon and self-restrained are probably better descriptors.

The Accommodations
The suite was huge and well-appointed with considerable attention to detail. While the hotel does not appear to have had a recent refit this is of no concern as the suite was designed in a style which does not date rapidly and is solidly constructed.

Amenities
The gym is good for a hotel of its size and generally appears underutilised so there is little if any competition for equipment. The Spa has a range of treatments, I only availed myself of the massages, and they were very good. I spent much of my time in the pool and it’s surrounds (being inherently lazy) and it is quiet and relaxing, the hotels website photos are accurate. We took a hotel car and driver to Ubud for a day (1.25 million Rupiah/8hrs), concierge assisted with an itinerary and instructed the driver, the driver acted as an informal guide at temples with which he was familiar. The hotels cars are new and comfortable and the hotel provided a breakfast box that easily sustained us for the day. The food is very good and caters to the western palate.

Staff
The staff is the hotels strongest feature they are all fluent in English, friendly without being intrusive and present as genuinely motivated to, and capable of, delivering a high standard of service. As the hotel is small (50 to 60 suites) this allows the staff to quickly become familiar with each guests particular wants and needs.

Guests
The clientele is predominantly (in descending proportional order) Australian, Western European, ASEAN. The adage that “The worst thing about Bali is the Australians” is not evident at The Legian. There is a mix of occasional honeymooners, couples with pre-school age children (noting we weren’t there during school holidays), adult daughter/mother or father/son combinations, gay couples however the majority of guests are couples in the 40 to 65 age bracket.

Location
The hotel has about 200m of absolute beach frontage (while it is not for the exclusive use of guests it is not used by many non-guests), is a 3 minute walk to Ku De Ta, and 10 minute walk to the main shopping eating streets of Seminyak, about 30 minutes from the airport (contingent upon traffic) and about 15-20 minutes to Kuta (and its various attractions/repulsions).

Conclusion
A very relaxing and enjoyable getaway, I highly recommend The Legian to travellers wanting a quiet high end beach holiday.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1744,fabulous,50,November 2010,"From arrival to departure the staff were wonderful. Discreet, elegant, friendly and very professional. My room had everything I needed and more. Loved the pool area and the pool staff are terrific. Left my sun glasses and next day at the breafast table there they are! Beakfast was the best I've had anywhere. The staff second guess what you want and whats more, get it right! Great location but be warned its very difficult to leave this place. You feel very spoilt and pampered!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1745,1st class service - beautiful hotel,50,October 2010,"We stayed here for our honeymoon for one week, it could not of been more perfect... In fact I don't know where to begin. To start with we were greeted with a refreshing moktail on arrival and seated in the lobby area while are check in was taken care of, I didn't realize that they had taken are bags already but when were given our tour of the hotel then our room our bags were waiting for us in our room. Our room was upgraded as we were honeymooners we stayed on the top floor, the view, the bed, the living area of the room was great, it had everything! The little things I loved about this hotel was the house keeping of the room nothing like I'd ever seen, in the morning they would open all window shades and clean and leave fresh fruit in the afternoon they would close all the shades clean and leave different chocolates to try each night and a little poem on the bed. The pool was amazing the pictures on the net and hotel site do not it justice, the pool staff were attentive at all times, as soon as you have chosen a sun bed, he was at your side with two towels each, glass of water, sunscreen and scented cool towels very refreshing. The breakfast was to die for, not only was it buffet you could also order from there delicious menu - French toast to die for. We got invited to the general managers cocktail party, which was held in one of the villas, we had cocktails on the house and got to meet the general manager, who was lovely - which is probably why her hotel that she managers is too. Overall it was magic, can't wait to return!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1746,Beautiful Villa with outstanding customer service thanks to our butler Sudiana,50,November 2010,"We stayed in The Club Villa's at The Legian Seminyak Bali. The Villa style accommodation was breath taking, complete with dipping pool, outside bath and open living rooms. The location was good with most of Bali's top attractions only a small drive away which our resort drivers were more than happy to drive us to. The customer service was amazing and was made extra special by our own private butler Sudiana, he really made our trip special and any request of ours was met with a friendly smile. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Bali!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1747,Best Hotel we have stayed in ......,50,October 2010,"WE stayed here for 8 days, after a week roughing it in Thailand. A stunning hotel, beautifuly laid out, lit and decorated. The Room we had had seven rooms contained in it - two bedrooms, massive bathrooms, lounge, dining area, kitchen etc. Little details are what makes this place great ..... each room had a surround sound system and they even gave us 2 fully loaded iPods. The staff are excellent and the management run this pl;ace very smoothly indeed. Nothing was too much trouble, and people seemed genuinely eager to make sure we had a good time there. highly recommended. We have stayed in nice hotels around the world, and I think this was the best so far!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1748,Attention to the Details are Amazing,50,October 2010,"Was there for some relaxation and my wife booked the room after reading the reviews.

I must say that the staff were very attentive to little details and proactively sought out our comfort. From the arrival, taking our names, serving us the welcome drinks, to a short briefing of the facilities, everything was perfect. The rooms were very clean, and staff were always a phone call away. For example, at the swimming pool, as we arrive, the staff will provide towels as we took our seats. Even to the checkout, we asked for an extension of 2.5 hours due to the flight and we were granted it outright after checking of the availability. And this was done by the front desk staff. She had no need to ask her manager and some higher approval. Just too many details to mention, but everyone we met was friendly and there was a sense that they were very willing to assist in every way.

Overall, I would stay with the hotel again. Have traveled the world and the service ranks up there in the Tier-1 category.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1749,Six star quality and service.,50,October 2010,"Just got back from staying at the wonderful Legian and had a fantastic time. The Hotel is well located in Seminyak, close to many fabulous restaurants and bars. The suites in the Hotel are amazing, yes they are slightly old, but its nice to still get a quality Balinese feel rathe than the sleek modern look which is everywhere at the moment. I travel all over the world, and have never had such great service. We had the VIP meet and greet at the airport, so while others were waitng in ques, we were whisked straight through and then transported in a lovely car, with cool scented facecloths and water. On arrival into our huge suite. there was champagne and nibbles awaiting us. The staff remembered our breakfast order each day and the pool side service was great. Yes it is expensive to eat at the Hotel, but the idea is to get out and about. I highly recommend Sarong and Metis as great restaurants, and you must try the Rock Bar at the Ayana Resort. You can get a lovely massage at nearby Bodyworks. Am already planning my next trip back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1750,Stunning from start to finish,50,October 2010,"We stayed at The Legian in Seminyak for the second part of our honeymoon trip. it was absolutely stunning, a real 5 star resort, and definitely one of the best hotels in Seminyak, if not the best. We were treated like royalty throughout our stay, the staff really couldn't do enough for us.

Our suite was immaculate and had every convenience we could think of, and some we hadn't!

There were so many great restuarants nearby to try out, that we didn't dine in much, but the resutarant menu looked delicious, and we had the occasional light lunch by the beach which was all superb.
Our suite had an outside varanda space as well, which was great for relaxing in. The pool and bars were just a short walk from our suite.

The weather was wonderful the whole tinme, but not too hot to walk around during even the hottest part of the day.

The hotel is about a 15 to 20 miunute drive to Kuta which is really worth a trip, especially for local handicrafts which was about 30% of prices quoted in the plush boutiques of Seminyak.

We loved best the real luxury of Seminyak, the hotel facilities and fabulous resaturants.
Not so great was that Seminyak is very commercialised and caters for western tourists. Expect to pay from about £40 to £50 per head for dinner at a popular high end resuatrant. The wine particularly is extraordinarily expensive. I ordered by the glass (as hubby doesn't really drink wine) and it tasted watered down to me, but still cost about £10 per glass!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1751,That is hospitality and service...,50,August 2010,"At last a real 5 star hotel that deserves them...Each and every one:
1*: location: ON the beach. Not by, near close to...ON the beach.
2*:service, service and service: the one you expect .Not the one you were told about in Asia but never really enjoyed.
3*:food is good. at the beach restaurant, at breakfast and for dinner. really good.
4*:rooms are vast, well equipped, neat, comfortable. so are the beds...
5*Even full, the hotel and its compounds are quiet , and amenities available for everyone!
Go, its expensive but worth each and every penny...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1752,Traditional Balineses Style Hotel,40,September 2010,"The Legian is a traditional Balinese style hotel, built many yeras ago. It still has that traditional feel about it with decor and room furnishings of the 70/80's era. It is located just outside Seminyak right on the beach front. Our stay started badly as the hotel failed to pick us up at the airport as prearranged. After some phone calls and a wait of one hours we were finally transported to the hotel, but not before the car driver tried to get us to pay 350,000 RUP for the trip. We refused to pay and were still taken to the hotel. Upon checking out the hotel tried the same trick and again we refused to pay. This was because we had already prepaid prior to our arrival. Upon arrival we were greeted in a pleasant manner and shown to our deluxe one bedroom suite. The room was large with a separate bedrrom with a king size bed, living area and separte bathroom with a full size bath as well as a shower. The room also had flat screen TV, ADSL internet, DVD and ipod player. No wireless interent although wireless is available in the hotel lobby area. The staff were very polite and friendly always refferring to us by name and were available to assist with bookings etc. However they would only book tours with the hotels own arranged tours which were more substantially more expensive than local tour operators. The hotel is approx 20 min walk from the main Seminyak shopping street with stretches several kms along the main road. The out door areas were fantastic, nice gardens with a great pool, however we found the pool water too hot to be really refreshing. The beach which is right in front of the pool is great for surfers, however rips abound and the red flag was raised the entire time of our 4 day stay. This makes the hotel not really suitable for young children. Drinks service around the pool area was slow, although there was always plenty of staff around, they were slack when it came to taking orders and returning with your drinks. Eating at the hotel is expensive as are drinks and Spa services. The food at the evening meal was excellent, however the same could not be said about breakfast, which was poor for a hotel of this standard. The Legian at Seminyak is approx 20/30 minutes from Kuta by car with the hotel providing a limited shuttle bus service. Seminyak is quieter than Kuta, but it also lacks the extensive designer shops that Kuta has. Overall, we had a nice relaxing stay with the traditional feel of the hotel contributing to our relaxing stay. Our advice is eat elsewhere as there are plenty of good restaurants close by.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1753,Divine,50,September 2010,"We stayed at the Legian for our first holiday away without our children (aged 5 and 2). The rooms were very large and included a large balcony area and internal sitting area as well as a kitchenette. The service was excellent in every way. Breakfast was included in the price of our room and you could chose from fresh fruit, asian style breakfast, baked goods/toast and a cooked breakfast which was excellent. After breakfast, we would head to the pool area where there was more than enough seating and no issue with people ""bagging the best day beds"" and never using them. Two large cabanas next to the pool served snacks and lunch and drinks could be ordered by the pool. All food was very reasonably priced - alcohol was expensive, but that is the case throughout much of Asia. We were very impressed with the level of security both at the entrance to the hotel and also the beach access - unless you were a guest of the hotel it was difficult to gain entry - there were two security guards at the beach entrance and also a lifeguard was posted for swimmers at the beach. We ate the majority of our dinners at the hotel - they were that good and so reasonably priced - they had a number of theme nights eg seafood barbecue and all the dinners were excellent. The hotel was well located to Seminyak, so shopping trips were just a walk or cheap cab ride away. We had a lovely time and would definitely recommend it to friends. Our only issue was the Jetstar flights too and from Bali - they were horrible, with the flight over being delayed by 18 hours!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1754,Beautiful and ageless,50,March 2010,"When we were shown our room we thought we had received an upgrade as we were in a huge suite, apparantly all the rooms are as big as ours or bigger. There is a huge foyer, kitchenette, guest toilet, dining and lounge, huge bathroom, bedroom and massive balcony with a bali bed and table and chairs and that's standard. Our travelling companions room was different to ours but just as large. The decor is elegant bali style and I found the hotel ageless and in very good condition, it was obviously built to last, with beautiful materials and is maintained to a high standard. The service was impeccable in all areas and the breakfast is amazing. Try the french toast with strawberries and marscapone, the freshest sushi or eggs any way. The location of The Legian is the best in Bali and my ultimate address. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and dream of hanging off the side of the infinity pool staring into the ocean again. If you can afford to stay here do.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1755,wonderful hotel but lacks communication by staff.,40,September 2010,"we have just returned from our stay at the Legian in a 2 bedroom suite, we have 3 young children so the room was just perfect. This hotel was fantastic for the kids as it was school holidays so more kids in the pool, and just more kids in general staying at the hotel.
I would say our greeting was really unsatisfactory, we were recommended this hotel by friends and all I have heard from travel agents and anyone who had stayed there was "" how good the service was"", well we were left in the lobby at check in with 3 kids, no smiles or special greetings I was expecting by the staff, not even a nice drink and cold towel. Our room was not ready which was understandable as we arrived 1 hour before check in, but really a hotel of this calibre should of had the room ready? They told us to use the pool while the room was being prepared for us. We felt really uncomfortable, we were not showed around the hotel at all, did not even know where the towel desk was or any facility in the hotel at all? We tried to find a lounge but at 1 pm in the afternoon that was a little hard so eventually we found one. We decided to head back to the lobby after 1 hour in the pool as we really wanted to check into our room. Eventually we were shown to the room which was perfect, on the ground floor, however the tall grass growing out of the pond really obstructs the view. At this stage we still had no idea where anything was in the hotel. The next day we found our own way around, ie- gym etc, eventually feeling comfortable with everything. I did not even know there was a shop in the hotel until the last day!
After a couple of days we started to relax and enjoyed our stay, the breakfast is just wonderful.
There certainly needs to be more communication in the hotel, I think for a family not to be shown anything was really poor, or anyone of that matter.
I also sent a card to the GM, no response as yet?
Great hotel but for the price, communication needs to be improved.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1756,Good but not the best,40,August 2010,This is a great hotel with large rooms and in a perfect location. A few things do bother me about the hotel vs others in this cateogory in Bali. Service is quite impersonal and a bit challenging around the pool area. The entire hotel is very dark with impact lighting - depends if that is your thing but I found it a bit dreary and trying too hard to be GHM chic. For a beach holiday it is not what I am looking for. Prices for beer and wine is expensive in all of Bali but this place is the worst (second only to the Oberoi). Be prepared to spend £8 for a small draft beer and £15 for a small sub-standard glass of wine. This rubbed me the wrong way - far more expensive than the trendy club/resto Ku De Ta next door and it feels a bit like once they have you in the hotel they shake you for all your worth. Spa overly expensive as well. I far prefer the Samaya next door. Not even comparable after having stayed at both. Samaya is on a completely different level of food and service.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1757,"Wonderful, best hotel in Seminyak!",50,September 2010,We stayed here for a week as the beginning of our trip around the world. We wanted to relax but also wanted to be near to shops and restaurants as we do not want to eat at the hotel every night. We had a One Bedroom Deluxe Suite which was really big and luxurious. Is was not the new flashy design room but it was very nicely done and had a wonderful bed. The Legian was particularly nice as it has a wonderful location close to Seminyak center and it is absolutely 5 star but not as formal as Four Seasons Hotel where we normally stay. Please note that this was the beginning of our trip so we wanted to have something informal. They also have a very nice gym. We saw most of the other hotels in the area but where very happy with our choice. THe only thing that I would change is that they have no wireless internet in the room. We would go back!,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1758,"Legian, Bali - A disaster at $850 a night",20,July 2010,"The Legian hotel in Bali, a disaster at $850 per night

I stayed at the luxurious Legian in Bali for 2 days. It was by chance, having traveled for more then 2 weeks in Bali trying to locate a spot where I will write my third book (I am a writer) and ending up deciding that Bali generally sucks, buying a ticket to Barcelona but prior to leaving wanting to indulge in one last try – a luxury hotel – the Legian in Bali, Seminyak.

The Legian reservation guy gave me a good sales pitch saying that although they are fully booked, there is a cancellation for 2 days (which fit my schedule) for only $650 a night, of course without 21% tax and service which is added later. Although this is an amount one could rent an apartment for a month in the US or a few months in many other countries, I said yes. I left the mid-ranged priced hotel (from the Lonely Planet guide) for $35 a night in the tourist Kuta where the night before I called management to eliminate no less then 6 cockroaches and took a taxi the next day, heading through the horrendous traffic of Seminyak, to my fantasy escape – the Legian hotel.

Trouble in paradise started early with an omen from my credit card showing error when the reservation agent tried to use it to block the full amount. Instead of seeing it as a sign to back out of this outrageous plan, I called my bank and fought with a few agents and a supervisor to get the blocked amount of over $2000 approved.

When I arrived no amazing smiles or greetings from staff were anywhere to be seen. I did not feel like the queen of the world. I was simply led to my room. The suite was large and nicely decorated but when I started unpacking and lifting the wooden blinds, I found out that they are broken, the string mechanism was not working so they would at best stand in a diagonal V shape when pulled up. I tried to fix it several times unsuccessfully, and then called reception who sent maintenance guys to look at it. Turns out, I had to wait in the room for 45 minutes for them to repair the blinds, in addition to maintenance staff not speaking any English and unable to explain how long their job will take. To cool down after this fine experience, I turned on the a/c to have it blast my ears with a loud sound, like a fan blowing at runaway models. Again I asked for maintenance to look at it and got some weird response about the fan being too close to the bathroom wall so that’s the reason for the loud sound. I got very angry and asked to speak to a manager. I was forwarded to a Balinese lady, the front desk manager, who came to my room and apologized very coldly for the “minor” problems, that’s exactly how she worded it, which I was experiencing. I said I will not pay the full price for a defective hotel room and asked for them to lower the room rate. She said she cant give me a discount as I was already given a discounted rate of $650 (although on the web site and on the phone when I booked no one mentioned a discounted rate), since the regular high season rate is $850 per night! What she can offer is to show me another suite if I wanted to change. Lets keep in mind this is already a few hours after I checked in and unpacked in my room.

The suite I was shown was much smaller then mine, with terrace half the size, (my terrace boasted 2 chairs and a table and a day bed, the smaller one had only the day bed tightly squeezed in the existing space). Upon entering the smaller suite I saw the same maintenance people working on the wooden blinds. I asked if these are broken as well and got the answer that they are just checking to see if they are ok (this wasn’t going in the right direction). I returned to my suite saying I will think about it. Not having given any answer in the next few hours, the front desk manager came to my door and gave me a complementary spa massage in the hotel. Again no warm apology for any inconvenience, just coldly passing the voucher to me. I took the voucher but of course that didn’t make me feel better. I didn’t come to this hotel for a massage, I came for the promise of impeccable design and surroundings coupled with amazing service.

A few bullets now about the “amazing” service:

• Most staff at the Legian hotel do not speak basic English, so I had to repeat anything I said at least 3 times in order to be understood.
• Staff entered my suite at their will; they would knock 3 times and if I didn’t answer they would unlock and enter – housekeeping, the ice boy, the laundry people etc etc.; now two things to keep in mind, I am in a suite at least 30 meters or 100 ft long and wide, with a large terrace, so even if I would hear the staff knocking, there wouldn’t be enough time to answer the door before they barged in – I could be undressed, I could be asleep, I could just be sitting in front of my computer, and their smiling faces would appear and enter my private space; and here is that second thing about the private space – of course one would ordinarily place the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door – but I didn’t have one or at least it was not on my door, actually, it was so obscure itself – a tablet with the engraved face and a finger over its lips which could have easily been mistaken for artwork, in addition to being placed in an even more obscure place – a tray by the bedside with some other hotel brochures and materials, so I basically never managed to find it. The staff finally brought me one the second day, after which life became a tad bit easier, since I was now only receiving written notes slid under my door.
• Even staff outside my suite did not respect my privacy – they made noise in the breakfast area nearby at 5 a.m., the gardener was sweeping in front of my bedroom at 6:30 a.m., another gardener was watering the plants right below my suite and continued to do so even when I came on my terrace even though he could see inside my suite and thus disturb me.
• Outside by the pool area, new problems awaited - beach beds were not prepared with towels on them, so every time I came I had to ask for towels - first it would take a while to find a staff member and then it would take a while for them to bring the towels; the afternoon tea which is included in the outrageous price is supposed to be served by the pool but was not offered to guests by the staff, I had to ask for it every day and again wait for approx. 15-20 minutes for my café latte and a few finger cookies to arrive – and this was not only the case with me, I saw other guests getting upset for having to wait for a long time.

If this is not enough to deter you from staying at the Legian, here are a few more reasons:

• an uncomfortable bed and mattress that made squeaking noise every time I sat or rolled on it
• a large stain on the bathroom sink area
• a large crack along the entire wall in the toilet area
• a broken shampoo bottle, with the top unable to screw properly so that when I picked it up the large ceramic bottom part fell on the shower floor hurting my foot
• pretty used up hair drier that I had to hold a button continuously for it to work
• stain on the day bed
• poor TV sound with base thumping loudly at some moments
• and NO LIGHTS ON THE TERRACE – none whatsoever, only a candle, so I had to take a lamp from inside and plug it outside.

Well this do-it-yourself attitude is certainly not why I came to the Legian at $850 a night. The tag line for GHM, the owner of Legian in Bali is “the style to remember”. I will remember them all right but certainly not by their style.

In closing, I will mention that one Legian staff member who was stationed at the airport should be commended for his service. He assisted me in checking at the business class counter although I had an economy ticket and went with me to the domestic terminal to get a refund on another flight I was not going to be taking. His English skills, service and dedication were impeccable. In addition he told me that his basic salary after working for Legian for 14 years is $100 per month. How obscene that this hotel would not only overcharge the guests for poor accommodation and service but exploit its staff as well. No kidding they weren’t in the mood to pamper me!

Epilogue

As a result of my written complaint to the general manager, I was reimbursed for one full night stay. The general manager was surprised with my experience and gave a few explanations re issues I brought forward. Among other things she said that new beds are expected to arrive in August (I stayed in July), and that cultural differences could account for some of the lack in service. I would say that just does not cut it for $850 a night!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1759,stylish!!!,50,May 2010,"Superb hotel, very elegant, good personal.... the pool area with full sea-view is great... food delicious! The managment was very kind and helpful, the front-desk arranged reservations for another beach in the south. Our room had 2 ipod with over 1000tracks all kind of music...breakfast buffet was amazing, nothing was missing",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1760,The Club at the Legian is a perfect rest,50,August 2010,"We chose the Club (as opposed to the hotel) for our vacation, and it was the best decision we could have made. Tucked away down a side street, the Club is private and cosy, with excellent service from our wonderful butler and the rest of the team, and a villa that I would happily move into on a more permanent basis.
As mentioned in previous reviews, you don't get the beach but it is literally a five minute walk away - and you can retire to your pool when the crowds get too much.
The restaurant at the Club has a limited menu, and the restaurant in the main hotel is fairly average, but as there are restaurants and bars aplenty in Seminyak this is hardly a problem. There is some building work going on nearby, but we found the noise very low level and it didn't affect our peace and quiet at all; the Club staff were very concerned that it would bother us and half the time we couldn't hear anything, never mind anything that would disturb us.
Extras you might not realise are there - free laundry, afternoon tea appearing in your villa, free local transport and all your restaurant bookings made by your butler.
Bliss. Enjoy!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1761,We stayed 4 nights at the Legian... wished we had stayed longer!,50,July 2010,"This hotel was definitely the best hotel we stayed in in Bali, with a great location in the heart of Seminyak.
At our arrival the room was not ready but they let us use temporarily another room while they were making the room ready.
We stayed in a one-bedroom suite which was huge with great balinese style decoration with all the usual luxury equipment (bose sound systems, blu-ray, etc.) but still maintaining a very relaxed atmosphere. All rooms seem to have this balcony with ocean view and a day bed on it. Also we came with our young baby and they had installed a very nice wooden crib in the room.
The pool is amazing, the food was also great; on the first night we stayed for dinner at the hotel and we had the best outdoor barbecue ever on the beach.
Very nice staff, always very helpful and great with our baby. Only negative aspect was the baby-sitting rate which was way too high compared to the other 5-star hotels we stayed in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1762,Nice hotel,40,April 2009,"My husband and I went to Bali in April 2009 and chose to stay at the Legian.

The Legian is located in Seminyak, a nice and chill part of town with good shopping and some well-known eateries. KuDeTa is literally just next to the hotel (although I don’t rate this restaurant).

We stayed in a One bedroom deluxe suite and it was lovely, very large dining area and living room. The separate bedroom was of good size and the bathroom was massive with a huge bathtub and shower. The room was very very cozy. The only downside is that our room was situated on one of the lower floors resulting in low visibility of the beautiful sea from our balcony which had a very comfortable day bed.

The thing we really loved about the hotel was the pool area, fantastic infinity pool with great snacks and drinks to enjoy the famous Balinese sunset.

Another thing worth mentioning is the spa. Even though my partner and I aren’t spa lovers we had four treatments at the hotel as they were good value for money.

We also took a trip to Ubud where we had lunch at The Legian’s sister hotel The Chedi Club. The surroundings were amazing as The Chedi Club was bang in the middle of the rice fields. Lunch there was out of this world as it felt like eating in the fields themselves.

The food at the Legian is very good both at The Restaurant and room service. Here are some other recommendations of where to eat: PJ”s at the Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay and eating with the mischievous monkeys at Il Ristorante at the Bulgari Resort.

Overall, we didn’t really take Bali into our hearts. But The Legian is first class, top notch for service, accommodation and ambience, especially when you take the price into consideration.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1763,Excellent - do not hesitate to book!,50,July 2010,"Don’t hesitate to book - this hotel is excellent and is exactly what the website and brochures describe - plus more!

We booked a one bedroom deluxe suite which was beyond expectations from the chilled Champagne on arrival onwards. Try to book a top floor if you can.

The aspect next to the beach is superb and very relaxing. The pool is a central feature but can be a little busy. A short stroll into Seminyak with it’s shops and wide selection of very good restaurants makes a perfect evening.

The staff could not be more attentive and friendly, yet are unobtrusive. Nothing is too much trouble for guests comfort. Breakfast is excellent quality with a wide range available and a lovely aspect overlooking the pool and gardens. The only slight down side is the rather high price of drinks and lunch menu.

We wished we could have stayed longer.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1764,One of my best hotel experiences...ever,50,May 2010,"The Legian is without a doubt one of my best hotel experiences ever. Everything from the room quality (we had a huge 2 bdrm suite), service, quality of dining, ameneties such a pool / spa etc were excellent. This was a special trip for my mother and not only did she feel completely happy at this hotel, she loved it so much that she missed it when we moved to our second hotel in Ubud...so much so that we had to call the Legian and see if we could come back (our last minute request was not only accomodated by the amazing manager, Carla, but we were given our previous suite again. I have travelled all over the world and very few places are as perfect as the Legian experience was for us.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1765,An example of an old but great hotel,40,May 2010,"I have been to Bali many times over the last 10 years and have stayed in many of the 5* hotels here. The Legian is old and not as swish, sleek and swanky as its newer rivals (St Regis, Alila Villas etc) but it certainly exudes a lot of charm. Yes, the rooms and furnishings are old but ours look recently re-painted and have been installed with very current gadgets e.g. bose sound system, 2 ipods (one in the lounge, one in the bed room) etc.
Service is excellent. We had the standard welcome drinks and cold towels when we were being checked in at the lobby but were nicely surprised by the bottle of bubbly in our room (sitting in a bucket of ice), together with canapes.
If you want to be close to all the restaurants and bars in Seminyak but relax in peace for most of the day before you go out and have fun, this is the place. It is also walking distance to ku de ta and La lucciola. You can walk along the beach, less than 3 minutes each way. They also have club rooms if you want newer and swish-er accomodation, but these are not beach-front and are across the road from the main Legian hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1766,Wonderful... again!,50,May 2010,"This was our third time in The Legian, and even as we were here before we were surprised by the high service level of this wonderful hotel. It definitely is one of Bali's best. The suites are gorgeous, they all have seaview and are beautifully decorated. Great service, very good breakfast buffet, all the details are allrigth: from the bottle of wine in the bucket of ice when we arrived in our room, the incense, the candles on the terrace at night, etc.
It's not typical suitable for childeren, but our kids (now 4 and 6 years old) always love it there. The staff is very friendly, there always seems so to be someone who takes them to the feed the fish or for a little walk. Nice swimming pool, body boarding at the sea. This time there actually were quiet a lot of childeren, but the hotel is also specially suitable for honeymooners and people who love their rest. Beautiful garden, stunning views, we will go back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1767,"Best location for Seminyak shopping, clubs but still enjoys your beach",40,September 2009,"The purpose of our trip is to interview vendors in preparing our Sep Bali wedding. So We booked a deluxe room last minute, then we got upgraded to junior suite (with balcony facing the beach) when arrived.

I LOVE Seminyak area which is great for boutique clothing shopping, hopping for trendy bar at night, nice restaurant. And you could do all these within walking distance with The Legian. Or simply a 5 -10 minutes taxi ride.

So
The "" + "" :
- good breakfast, nice menu, great location in Seminyak , the beach is more clean than that of the Sofitel which is down under Seminyak.
- the beach is quite too (please don't compare those in Nusa Dua which is better )
- the great balcony which you could sit outside with comfort sofa
- great services and staffs are very helpful

The ""-v"":
- they might need to upgrade their bathroom which is a little run down as the toilet didn't flush well which I believe they are a bit too old now
- the toilet amenities is not great, so girls, remember to bring your own

If you want shopping, convenience, dining, clubs & bars but still enjoy some nice beach and sun. This might be a good choice. If you don't want to spend that much and no need to have the beach, then you should book some boutique hotel instead of staying in this one.

1768,The Legian is back as one of the best hotel in the world,50,March 2010,"If i've decided not too choose The Legian for my holidays during a 3 years period, it's bacause there were a few problems unacceptable for a five stars hotel. I've had a discussion with the previous GM who wasn't really nice but thanks God, a new GM arrived and took all my remarks very seriously and now, this is the rebirth of The Legian, still superbly located on Pettitenget beach and offering the epytom in term of confort of service. Our last stay in March has been more than amazing...

*Check in/Service: When you arrive at The Legian, you know immediatly you'll have such a luxurious experience. After the very serious security check, the car will drop you in a little heaven where you'll be welcome as a king with the authentic balinese smile and a legendary professionnalism. Each member of the staff at The Legian will treat you with the perfect attention you expect, using your family name all the time, trying to provide a WOW little detail to make of your holidays an amazing and unforgettable moment.
We arrived in this fantastic property a day where there was refurnishment making the lobby much more smaller than usual but still very beautiful and moreover, we checked in at 1pm which is a bit early. However, after a few minutes waiting and a quite efficient check in procedures, the very nice GM Carla came to say hello and she apologized cause the two suites we booked were not ready but she offered us the possibility to stay in the hospitality room to get changed and be able to enjoy the pool without waiting. Actually, this hospitality room is one of the service offered by The Legian for early check in or late check out guests and this is a real ""plus"" cause you can relax, have a shower, check your emails...
But it was really hot at this time of the day and we had decided to wait inside this room. About 45 min later, we have been escorted to our studio suites and as return guests, some welcome cocktails, a bottle of excellent champagne and a large basket of fresh fruits were ready on the table. I can't imagine a better check in... Just FABULOUS...

*Design/Confort: What to say about ""perfect luxury""??? Maybe i could just say something: ""hard to leave""... The smallest suite offers a space of 90 sq. meters with huge terrace overlooking the ocean. The design at The Legian is timeless, elegant, relaxing... They have upgraded a few details always using the nicest materials and making of the decor something even better (new sofas, tables, lighting...). You'll feel really like at home and the same experience of luxury is in the bathroom with a very large space, double sinks, a rain shower, a very comfy bathtub and a perfect lighting which is a very important detail so often wrong in many hotels.
About the confort, there is absolutely nothing to add apart of PERFECT... (bed, linens and pillows from the highest quality) and now there is a blind curtain making an excellent black out for having a good sleep. Thanks to improve this detail i consider essential for confort...

*Food: Like everything at The Legian, Food and beverages are excellent and don't miss the french toasts with strawberry and mascarpone for breakfast. The most delicious starting day before to lay down in front of the two exceptionnals pools. For lunch and dinner, same satisfaction with the finest ingredients and the very intelligent recipes of the Executive chef.

*Atmosphere: Elegance and luxury are everywhere at The Legian. This is undoubtly one of the nicest place for spending holidays and if you choose this property amazingly located in front of the ocean and in the vibrant and trendy Seminyak, you'll never ever try to try an other hotel cause there is no challenger with The Legian. A home sweet home in Bali, perfect and impressive.

*Conclusion: Thanks to Carla, the excellent GM, and the whole team of The Legian. Now, this property is back in my heart and personnaly, i consider this hotel as one of the five best over the globe. An experience not to be missed...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1769,Expensive but Worth it,50,February 2010,"Location: Just by the beach, half an hour drive from either airport or Kuta. There are a couple of resturants nearby, but expensive compared with Indonesian CPI. We stayed almost within the hotel because it was great.

Rooms: All rooms are suites with a balcony facing the beach, though the temperature outside is always high unless in late afternoon. I chose the most affordable one, which covered around 100sqm.
Mini bar in kitchen, where you can cook coffee or afternoon tea;
dinner table available besides a desk with free internet access;
a large sofa located in the open living room where LCD TV, Blue Ray player, Bose sound box connected with an iPod classic are for your use;
two wardrobes, two washstands, one shower room and one bathtub are quite guest-friendly.

Service: Don't hesitate to ask for anything and be ready to get satisfying answers
We were offered a mini van pick-up upon arrival at the airport. Iced towl and Evian serviced by driver;
After arrival, fresh welcome juice came with a receptionist guided us around the hotel and into our suite to make everything clear to understand.
During our 5-day-4-night stay there, house keep frequency was twice a day, one around noon and the other around 6~7.pm, which made all amenities tiny and supplemented before it was necessary.

Value: I chose a flight+hotel package from a travel agent, who offered relatively lower room rates than the promotion price on the hotel's website. Probably around $370/night (in Feb. 2010) with all service charge or taxes. Thus I think the experience there is worth the money!",The Legian Seminyak Bali

1771,love it,50,October 2009,"WE have stayed at the legian twice now and wouldn't stay anywhere else.
yes, the rooms are getting a bit tired, but this is a beach holiday so you really don't need cutting edge interior design, the important thing is ti feel relaxed...and there is no other way to feel but relaxed at the legian.

The staff are the best I have ever encountered other than staying at another GHM hotel , the Chedi in Milan, so this is one hotel company that trains and looks after their staff well.

The service is faultless, the grounds are beautiful, it has the best location on the beach in Seminyak, the shopping and restaurants nearby are amazing, the poolside service is amazing. the rooms are huge 110sqm!! It is more like an apartment than a hotel room.

The babysitting ( request Made or Ayu) is the best in the world!!!

You would be crazy to stay anywhere else!!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1772,Exceeded already high expectations. Can't wait to return.,50,February 2010,"SUMMARY: Prime oceanfront property in Seminyak with huge suites, fantastic dining, and some of the best sunsets you'll ever see. This along with great service and excellent value make this one of the best hotels I've ever experienced.

ROOMS: A friend and I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite that was so large I could run laps inside. In addition to the spacious comfort, they were immaculately clean with tasteful design and furniture. Our enormous balcony had superb views of the property gardens, ponds, pool, ocean, and sunsets. There were also two huge bathrooms and a large kitchenette. These might possibly be the nicest hotel suites in Seminyak or maybe all of Bali.

SERVICE: Great service with a warm smile. The Balinese are well known for their genuine hospitality and big beautiful smiles, and this hotel's staff was a model example. The staff I interacted with was knowledgeable and provided efficient service, although some of them were soft-spoken and a bit difficult to understand at times.

AMENITIES: The pool was extraordinary. It was elevated just slightly above sea level to create a great view of the ocean while swimming. The gym was quite small, but I was told the hotel has plans to expand the facility. The restaurant beside the pool served a fantastic dinner, but I still can't believe I had the best french toast of my life at the hotel breakfast, in Bali of all places.

LOCATION: The location is flawless for those who want to be directly on Seminyak beach, which I believe is among the most beautiful beaches in Bali. Shopping is a stone's throw away, as are some of the well established entertainment venues like KuDeTa right around the corner.

CLEANLINESS: The hotel appeared to be spotless, especially the guestrooms. Even the beach behind the property was well maintained. There is some renovation work going on in the hotel which made for some minor noise pollution, but overall everything was quite picturesque.

VALUE: Compared to a standard hotel room, this property provided excellent value. The sheer size of the suites was enough to make me smile like a kid in a candy shop, but the inclusion of a kitchenette, free room Internet, and its oceanfront location provide incomparable value.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1773,AMAZING.......................,50,January 2010,"We stayed at the Legian for five days recently.WOW we were totally blown away by the service, the surroundings and the wonderful staff in this hotel.
On arrival we were upgraded to a suite with a view of the ocean.The staff were attentive and called you by your name.They provided a customer service that surpassed any we have ever come across before.Nothing was ever too much trouble and most of the time you were provided with every thing you needed without even asking.
Though the hotel is small and is getting older we could not fault it at all and are looking forward to returning to this place called Paradise.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1774,Club Legian - great place to stay in the Seminyak area,50,December 2009,"As background, we have seen quite a few hotels in Bali – stayed in Amanusa, Amankila (beautiful!), Bvlgari (trendy!), Como Shambhala (amazing & surreal), Intecontinental and I’ve taken a look at the Oberoi (getting a bit old), new St Regis (if you like American-style luxury), Conrad and Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay (getting old).

We came in with ‘managed’ expectations as friends warned us that Legian is getting a bit tired. I must admit, we didn’t spend much time in the main building (which may indeed be a bit old), so for those of you looking at rooms there, this feedback may not be of much help.

However, if you interested in the ‘Club’ section, I can say that we had a terrific stay. The butler service was genuinely attentive – we stayed in Amanusa two weeks later and while we are Aman fans, the service there just did not measure to Legian Club's. The room service food was really, very good – wish we had time for another room service meal. The villa’s are comfortably nice -- tasteful décor and enough patio area to have guests over (although the pool is still a tad too small to be functional in any way).

The ‘packages’ that they typically offer – open mini bar, free laundry, free transportation, etc. – is a nice treat. Most of all, if you want to be in Seminyak, which is by far the most hip place in Bali, with a selection of restaurants and bars, then Club Legian is a super convenient and nice high-end place to stay. No need to take a 40 minute car ride to Ku De Ta … it’s now across the street.

Bear in mind that the Club section is across the street, slightly removed from the beach area.

While we typically don't mind spending for upgraded rooms in places like Bvlgari Hotel, etc ... Club Legian is more reasonable priced than its comparable hotels, making our overall experience really a positive one.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1775,Probably best high end option in Semyniak,40,August 2009,"Stayed one week at the Legian. I have to say that even though we had a good time I think Bali is very overrated as top destination. Beach is so-so, traffic very bad, and old time charm has been considerably weakend by real estate furious development. That being said there is a lot of components to a nice stay (restaurants, bars, luxury resorts). Sticking to the legian although quite tired this hotel which should definitely go through a renovation program if it wants to keep its attractivity is to my point of view the best one in the bustling and trendy area of Seminyak (there are others in Jimbaran but I would not go there if in Bali, it's too far form the center and if wanted to go in a top hotel for beach and seclusion I would not go to bali). Hotel setting is top, gerat beach access, nice pool, and overall great service.On weak points, OK rooms but again too tired, Their gym is a shame and rates are a little too high especially since you have to add local tax on what's advertised.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1776,EXCELLENCE,50,January 2010,"We stayed at The Legian from Dec 26 - Jan 2 and could not fault the hotel. The rooms are massive, clean and have all mod cons plus more - we stayed in a one bedroom suite. We travelled with 2 very young kids, 6 months & 2 years and found the hotel very kid friendly.
Great food, service, rooms, pool, everything! 10/10 Nearly forgot all day free gelato!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1777,Impresionante suite,50,June 2008,"We spent part of our honey moon in this hotel.
Although it was tues agresive we enjoyed the private beach, as well the swimming pool.
Our room was huge, with an excellent bathroom and al the commodities you can imagine (i-pod, LCD, DVD player...).
Service really good, very helpful.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1778,Another great hotel,50,November 2009,"This was the final location on our trip to Hong Kong & Bali (see Intercontinental Hong Kong & The Chedi Club at Tanah Gajah).

The Legian is situated on a fabulous stretch of beach in Seminyak. The rooms are huge as it is an all-suite hotel. We had a bedroom with large living area, large bathroom and 2 balconies one with table & chairs the other with sunbeds as well as a small kitchen with a full size fridge (great for stocking up on cold drinks). Usual LCD TV, Bose sound system but also 2 pre-loaded iPods with around 5,000 songs on each of all different taste/genres and included headsets so you could take them with you too the pool (great idea).

The pool is a 2 tiered infinity one that overlooks the sea and was rarely busy during the week we were there. They also have plenty of sunbeds and large daybeds around the beachfront. They bring you iced water, cold towels and high factor sunscreen on arrival at the pool.

The restaurant food is very good and the lunchtime snack menu at the poolside bar usually has a good chefs special such as seared tuna or red snapper in addition to the usual snack fare. As usual the service was excellent and delivered with a smile (thanks Artini).

Location is 5 mins into shops at Seminyak where there is a great selection of boutiques & lots of bars and restaurants. We ate at La Lucciola (decent but over priced), Hu'u Bar (fantastic setting, good food and superb service) have to mention Ratna and April who looked after us fantastically. We also ate at the Queen Tandoor in Seminyak... avoid, food was mediocre and if it rains (which it did the night we were there) you are in danger of getting soaked as it pours through the roof!

The only watch-for is the building works going on next door (it looks a major project) and whilst It caused me no trouble during day round the pool, in fact the crashing waves made more noise, but when on my balcony it was intrusive (nothing the hotel can do about it, but I was not informed that it was happening)

In all a really top hotel with super service and a great location...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1779,"Great hotel, wonderful service, but one things.....",50,September 2009,"Service is great, food is wonderful, and room space is well designed. But there is only one thing that is annoys me and my husband. We stayed there for 4 nights and we see the hotel manager walks around and greets his guests. He appears to avoid the Asian guests; he skips our table (but talks around our table) and never stops by and says hi. He only stops by and greets the Europeans and Americans. It certainly made our stay less perfect and feels not welcome there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1780,The Legian does not disappoint!,50,October 2008,"My husband (boyfriend then!) and I decided on The Legian because our tour agent had a very good bundle deal on this resort together with The Chedi at Tanah Gajah, and also because both are GHM run resorts. You can’t really go wrong with the GHM group and I have to say we were not disappointed!

We stayed at The Legian for 2 nights as part of the bundle offer and right from the time we checked in, we felt like we were treated as VIPs. All the staff were very well-trained and polite, and throughout our stay, most of them remembered and greeted us by our surnames. This sort of personal service is hard to maintain, even at other luxury class hotels. We were also pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a 1-bedroom suite (from a junior suite) as the room we booked was not ready yet.

The 1-bedroom suite was luxurious and huge, in fact, bigger than the old apartment I lived in! Although the décor in the room may not be as modern as some other resorts in seminyak, it was very comfortable and spacious, very well-appointed, had a huge bathroom and balcony and had all that you would need if you decide to stay in the room all day and not go out. There are 2 pre-loaded iPods and a BOSE iPod docking station in the bedroom and another BOSE entertainment system in the living room if you prefer to watch TV or a video.

Breakfast was great and the quality good. The spread was good and they use very fresh ingredients in their food. It also helps that the restaurant faces the sea and you get fresh sea breeze flowing through while you enjoy your food! The same restaurant also serves dinner and at night, can become a very romantic venue for candle-lit dinner. Dinner prices are definitely not cheap by Bali standards but you get good quality, fine dining cuisine for a fraction of the price back home. It’s also worth paying for the ambience as you relax and let the sound of waves wash away whatever stress you couldn’t get rid of while you slowly savour the sumptuous meal which the chef has prepared for you.

The Legian is a family friendly resort, so if you are looking for somewhere exclusive for couples only, this may not be the most ideal place. However, the resort is generally peaceful and you’ll only hear children bantering at the pool. Overall, given the level of service, F&B quality and accommodation, I would highly recommend The Legian without a doubt!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1781,Fabulous in Every Way,50,September 2009,"Going to Bali was a big step for my husband.... he had never really enjoyed it. But after staying at The Legian he is already planning our next visit!

Whilst the rooms may not offer the modern style of some of the surrounding private villas, they were spacious, extremely well equipped with state of the art technology, and were impeccably clean. Turn down service was a delight, creating the most romantic of settings.

The pool area was relaxing, whilst maintaining a buzz..... not boring like some of the private boutique hotels where you never seem to see other guests. Cocktails were fabulous, food was fantastic ( especially Friday night seafood by the sea), and breakfast was my favourite meal of the day.

My daughter was very well cared for by both the staff and the wonderful nanny that was arranged through the hotel. All the staff played with her, and she had a sensational time. Children are very well catered for wrt food, but there are no specific children activities provided by the hotel (the pool offers more than enough entertainment in my opinion)

No request ever seemed too great for the wonderful staff at The Legian. Everybody addressed you by name...... I don't ever recall someone not knowing who I was. Wow... how great that makes you feel.

If visiting The Legian, book direct through the hotel as I missed a few services by using a travel agent. Also, use their visa service as Bali Airport Customs was a nightmare.

The Legian, and in particular the friendly, intelligent staff surpassed all my expectations. Everybody I know who stays there had said it was fabulous, but you can only truly understand how wonderful it is by booking your next holiday there.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1782,World Class Honeymoon,50,August 2009,"My husband and I just returned home from our honeymoon in Bali. We originally planned one week at the Legian and one week at the Maya Ubud. However, we ended our trip in Ubud early and went back to the Legian for the rest of our honeymoon. Without question, the Legian is the most wonderful hotel we have ever stayed in. First of all, the staff at the Legian is world class, top notch service. We cannot stop talking about how wonderful and hospitable the staff is there. The rooms are so romantic and comfortable. ( A honeymoon “baby bali” is probable!) ;) The food was delish. And the hotel offers tea time and icecream as just nice, little, free afternoon touches – but that’s what makes this hotel amazing. There are little touches here and there that take your experience over-the-top. We had spa services, which of course was fabulous. But I could not end this review if I didn’t mention the view. The pool, beach set up is what I expect to heaven to look like. To look out on the magnificent Indian ocean while taking a dip in the beautiful pool is just astonishingly relaxing and romantic. Each day we had a poolside/beachside bed with an umbrella, and the staff waits on you the whole time – with drinks and food making your relaxing day beyond enjoyable. The Legian, without question, is the most romantic place on earth.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1783,What is there not to LOVE about this hotel!!!!!,50,July 2009,"This hotel does not dissapoint! When we first arrived we were shocked about how spacious and beautiful our suite was. With a view of the ocean we thought there had been a mistake and that we were upgraded! The rooms are immaculate and the breakfast in the hotel was fabulous.
The beach location is on the nicest part of Seminyak beach, go further down past KuDeTa and it's crowded and not very pleasant at all. You can laze about comfortably on a day bed or sit on a lounge by the pool which is possibly the best pool in Bali! Hotel staff are so attentive, constantly ensuring your glass of cool water is filled, at 4pm afternoon tea is served and at any time you can go and get the best gelato complimentary!
Every detail has been thought out in this hotel even providing you with a beach bag to carry your sunscreen and book down to the beach, I cannot think of anything that they could do better or any other service they could provide.
The service was so friendly yet professional at the same time. Every encounter with every staff member was smooth, not a single mistake was made and you really got the sense that everybody who worked in the hotel were proud to be there, and that they like an extended family!
The location of the hotel was so convient for shopping and dining in Seminyak.
We will definately be going back (every year from now on hopefully) and it was worth every single cent!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1784,This is 5 star,50,,"Just got back from 4 nights at the Legian after spending 3 nights in Ubud.
Could not fault anything about the hotel.The room, pool, grounds, reataurant, bar, spa & above all the service were top notch.
Not cheap, but you get what you pay for.
The location is excellent, right on the beach & within walking distance (or a short cab ride) to many restaurants, bars & shops.
Had dinner at the hotel one night (Wednesday night Bali Feast - very good) & also went to Sarong, Breeze at the Samaya & Kafe Warisan which were all excellent.Security has been beefed up everywhere after the Jakarta bombings so get used to having your bag searched.
The only downside (which is not really the fault of the hotel) is that
the surf appears quite polluted (but then so were the French riviera beaches) which is kind of a shame given that the beach is what started all this.I guess lots of tourists simply go in the pool.

1785,Expensive trip,30,April 2008,"After travelling from the lights and sights of Hong Kong the Legian was a bit of a shock. Grey and Dull. But that was Balinese or was it just dull?
Our first room so smelly we had to wait to be moved to a second one, which was much better. The wardrobes had to be sprayed even in that one. Not a good start. We had requested a sea view room but ended up with a view of palm trees

Grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The beach beds were fabulous and usually free at the end of the day to watch the amazing sunsets. They were fantastic.

It was a wonderfully quiet resort where you could relax anywhere but it lacked atmosphere especially in the evenings

The downside while we were there was that a large family were staying prior to a wedding, which was taking place in another hotel.
They seconded the sun beds in the best spots all day even though they went out.

Sun beds for Mum and Dad, Baby and Nanny, Grandma and Granddad, Uncle and wife, Niece and Nephew, Great Grandma. And any friends that they were expecting to visit. It became their own private pool. Get the drift. No one in the hotel would do anything about it.

Breakfast was really good fresh strawberry waffles to die for.
Lunch was OK. Dinner disappointing and frugal very very expensive. We ate out and would recommend

The Living Room a walk away the ambience is sublime!

Ku Ad Ta the food was delicious, the service very helpful and friendly and the atmosphere beautiful. Great for a sunset drink
The open air Italian restaurant up the beach La Lucciola is just the best. The views are spectacular and the food good

We were shocked at the prices in Bali especially the wine.

1786,"great location, very friendly staff, nice rooms",50,July 2009,"I have seen quiete a few (luxury) hotels in Bali. The Legian has the perfect combination of location, reasonable value for money, atmosphere and very friendly and well-trained stutt. If you do not want to have a good time in the middle of nowhere (like Bulgari, Amankila or Karma Kandara) but you are looking for some infrastructure, you should consider going here.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1787,Luxurious Legian!,50,September 2007,"When I think of one of the hotels that I have visited that I remember the most, it must be Legian!
The whole ambience of the place is so relaxing, the staff attentive and ever present, the location, the view...

Ok, the decor and interior is not that contemporary anymore, the rooms could indeed need a facelift. But this is not a drawback to this place, it is rather a surplus because it gives the hotel a casual luxurious feeling!

What makes it so special is the level of service, the small poems on your pillow every night, the way you are greeted in the morning. The pool concierge that brings you cold water, fresh towels and a snack, even before you have taught about it yourself. The breakfast staff remembers that you prefer a little milk and only one tea spoon of sugar in the coffee, and only a twist of lime in the water.....
You feel like royalty!

The location is unbeatable, right on the beach in Seminyak, secluded but close to Kuta, party and restaurants.
The breakfast was one of the best ever, with everything you can possibly think of, all fresh made. We also had dinner at the hotel one night, great seafood and new world wines. Truly memorable to dine right at the pool with the candles and lanterns hanging in the trees around you, the moon over the Indian Ocean and the waves rolling on the beach. Why was I there for business, and not romance?!?! :(

I had a 110 sqm suite with separate dining and living room, a small kitchenette, balcony with daybed, bedroom with a 4 poster bed and a huge bathroom. Again, the furniture and decor is not top notch and a little worn, but who cares at this place!

If you want nothing but the best, chose Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1788,"Stunning hotel, beautiful ambience, wonderful staff, in 1 word : perfect",50,July 2008,"This was my 5th trip to Bali but the first time with kids. Our honeymoon 9 years earlier was at the Intercontinental Jimbaran Bay, but i rate this much higher. Bali changed a lot in 9 years and what astonished me was the change in Seminyak , now a truly cosmopolitan and upmarket part of Bali where we felt very relaxed and at home. I was very impressed - being away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta but close enough to zip in and out easily. This time we chose The Legian. Its appropriate they don’t call it a ‘hotel’ because it doesn’t feel like a hotel, since its smaller, quieter and more intimate than the big name hotel chains that have overflowing buffet and pool areas. Boutique hotel just about sums it up. We stayed in the 2 bedroom Seminyak Suite for 7 nights but at US$1500 per night it was not what I would call a ‘value for money’ holiday but that was not what were looking for then. In any case its hard to assess value for money really since its such a subjective issue. We didn't have a choice because we booked late and there was nothing else available and our flights were locked in, so were kind of forced to spend a lot of money for a priceless family holiday but I don’t regret it for a millisecond. There will be some who will refuse to pay this kind of money, but this hotel has something I never experienced at any other hotel and I have been lucky enough to have stayed at a few nice ones for both business and pleasure over a 15 year period of being able to afford to. So when I want to spend that sort of money, I would not hesitate and stay there again. I would advise anyone to try it out for a night or 2 and I guarantee you will more likely save up your money for next time !
The views from our room were just amazing, right out to sea and overlooking the pool. We had 2 butlers, they delivered breakfast to our room every day or we could eat it in the restaurant (alacarte), we had Moet champagne and yummy canapes delivered at 4pm every afternoon and 24 hour limousine service to anywhere as far as Kuta or Sanur. Our mini bar was stacked with all kinds of munchies, chocolates and drinks, both alcoholic and soft drinks and we could feast as much as we wanted for no extra charge – I ate too much! We had unlimited laundry service, they picked up our clothes in the morning and they were beautifully pressed and delivered to us that afternoon ; internet was included but I never felt the need to get online as this was a holiday and the last thing I wanted was to look at a computer. Even daily newspapers from our home country were delivered (printed off the internet in tabloid size) to our room by 9am each morning. There was actually nothing more we needed or wanted. All of these extra services were included as standard in the Seminyak Suite tariff so when you take it all into account you probably get a few hundred dollars worth of extras not added to your bill – the bottle of Moet alone would be US$100 in any other hotel. So when it came to check out time, the bill was only the nightly rate plus babysitting and a few pool snacks. I forgot to mention about their cocktail hour at the beach bar when all drinks and snacks were included !
The staff treated us like VIP’s and although there was no kids club, our 3 kids all under 10 enjoyed themselves in the pool - they still talk about the free ice creams.
What I loved about this hotel was the location for several reasons apart from proximity to shopping (my wifes passion) - there was a consistent surf break out the front which was never crowded and I surfed great waves on low tide every day (later I found it was called the “Kudeta left”), I didn’t need to go looking elsewhere, and it was located in between 2 of the best restaurants, nightspots in Bali, Kudeta and La Lucciola. We simply walked to most of our lunches and dinners.
The babysitting service provided by the hotel was a minor but contentious issue. At US$15 per hour, this might seem a small thing, but for the number of hours we used the babysitter (who was great), it added up. I didn’t realise until checkout that they actually charge US$5 per hour per child, but this was my fault because I didn’t read the fine print on the agreement I had signed. Once I realized this I did query them and they were nice enough to adjust the bill because usually the babysitter was only with our 3 year old when the older ones accompanied us elsewhere. It’s also worth noting that there isn’t really any organized kids activities except for fish feeding at the pond and some drawing activities in the afternoon, but the Manager told us they were thinking of increasing these activities.
The meals in the hotel were above average price and I cannot comment on the dinners because we never ate there except breakfast and the odd pool snack, but I have no complaints about any of the food we ate. I have to say the breakfasts were very very good . They also have an inhouse gym and spa, neither of which we indulged in.
The Legian certainly delivers on privacy. I would have our honeymoon all over again if I could at this hotel. The grounds are beautiful and spacious, the decor elegant, tasteful and minimalist, the atmosphere relaxed and quiet, right down to the gamelan musicians every afternoon, and the wonderful 2 tiered pool. I have to say the Seminyak Suite is by far the best resort accommodation I have ever stayed in, it was more like a house than an apartment with 2 massive balconies, huge en suite bathrooms, large living area and absolutely no details left to chance, like Ipods with great music selection and Bose docking stations. There was never a scramble for chairs around the pool, there were large daybeds overlooking the beach with huge umbrellas and I would simply relax and read my book there every day if not surfing– my favourite was a personal cabana further away from the pool near the bar. All in all, a blissfully relaxing holiday, and we arrived back home totally relaxed and rejuvenated. I would save up for this Hotel and splurge when we can another time - we will be back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1789,Second Visit in 12 months - Cannot Wait to go Back - Class all the Way,50,June 2009,"You know sometimes you go back to a place that you loved only to find it was not as good the second time?? Last year we spent a week at The Legian and came home raving - subsequently a few of our friends booked and we thought it was time to return ourselves. You hope things have not slipped and all the little things you loved are still in place. Delighted to say that it was still AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.

Cannot fault one thing.

Our room was outstanding - the food was sublime and again the thing that keeps us coming back is the service. I believe the crew there should be a test case to all those in hospitality. From the drivers, reception, housekeeping, gardeners they are all wonderful. The Management Team were beyond ridiculous when it came to keeping the guests happy... a sentiment that was echoed around the pool with other guests.

We ate a lot at the resort (why wouldn't you) which was fantastic - great cocktails and lunches. Had the Seafood BBQ one evening - delightful. Breakfasts were great and I always looked forward to the little treat left each evening in your room - those brownies!!!!!

For what you experience, i believe it to be extremely good value.

WE were lucky enough to go up to the Sister Property THE CLUB in Ubud. Our next visit will include a few days at this exquisite resort. You feel like you are in Royalties Private Compound - very romantic and secluded with a wonderful atmosphere. Very serene.

Thanks to the team - please reserve our room for 2010.",The Legian Seminyak Bali

We absolutely love this hotel and among all places we've been to, The Legian ranks n°1. I guess it has to do the the right combination of atmosphere, elegance, style, attention for detail, service, genuine friendliness, location, quality, balance between modern & traditional, etc... And of course the beachfront top location in Seminyak: great strech of beach and great sea. If you want to have the best, there is only one option: The Legian!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1792,The best hotel that we have stayed in!,50,April 2009,"My wife and 2 sons spent 7 nights in this hotel. The service was the best that I have encountered anywhere in the world. Almost all of the staff knew our names, and not because we constantly complained... I think that it helps that it si a smaller hotel.
The managment where always around, but not because they had to be so that the blocks could be ticked on the rating card.
We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, both with ensuite bathrooms. This was terrific with great views and lots of space. Lots of original Balinese wood and decor but very tasteful. I had some trouble getting my laptop connected, the concierge was ther to help in about 2 minutes.
The restuarant was excellent and we ate there for 5 out of our 7 nights. The wine list was comprehensive with excellent selections. (Maybe a bit pricey?) But the service and food made up for that.
The spa was with out a doubt the best I have been to. So good that I visited it 3 times as opposed to my normal 1 visit.
The hotel is situated in a quiter part of the beach, which suited us. It's only a 5 minute drive to the action.
A terrific holiday at a terrific hotel. Substantially better than the One & Only in Maurtius and Maldives with much more personalised attention.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1793,Perfect Beach Vacation,50,April 2009,"The Legian Bali is the perfect beach resort. The stretch of beach in Seminyak is far enough away from the crowds in Kuta and feels private.
There are many nice restaurants and bars in Seminyak (Breeze, Kudeta, Sarong) and good shopping nearby and easily accessible.
The hotel itself is just amazing. As my parents joined as well we decided to stay in a two bedroom suite. The room was just perfect. Huge bed and bathrooms, perfectly clean and overlooking the ocean.
All facilities (gym, spa, restaurant) are state of the art.
The garden is very large and offers many locations to enjoy the beautiful sea view and simply relax.
Only the hotel pool is a little small and way too hot. But who needs the pool if you got the ocean just in front of you?",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1794,An unforgettable experience,50,March 2009,"We stayed at The Legian in late March for our honeymoon and it was fabulous. From the moment we arrived, until we departed we were very impressed with the service, amenities and accomodation.

Check in was seamless with a cool drink and personal greeting from the hotel manager. We entered our room where we had a bottle of champagne and 'honeymoon' cake waiting for us. Our room was on the ground floor which was perfect as we still had a gorgeous view and easy access to the restaurant, pool area and beach.

Breakfast was perfect every morning and when we ate in the restaurant or ordered room service, the food was excellent.

The location is terrific with several great local restaurants in walking distance.

The air conditioning was first class which is what you need in Bali! We were also highly impressed with the level of cleanliness of not only our room but the entire hotel. Our room was serviced twice daily by three friendly staff and we received complimentry bottled water each day. We also looked forward to our little cakes, brownies and other treats that were brought to our room at turndown service (no charge of course).

The concierge and front desk were always extremely helpful. If you stay at The Legian I would also recommend a manicure/pedicure at The Spa - divine! The pool area is so pristine and relaxing. The gorgeous infinity edge pool is the perfect temperature. The pool attendants provide you with towels, iced water, fase mist and cold face towels while you are relaxing and they are very attentive at filling up your water. We did not have any issues getting a spot by the pool each day but the hotel did seem very quiet at the time of our stay.

We had a delightful experience on the last day (my husband's birthday). The Hotel had realised it was his birthday and surprised us at breakfast by singing happy birthday, bringing us a beautiful cake and two glasses of champagne (all complimentry!).

The stand-out at The Legian is the amazing, beautiful people that work there and their impeccable service. It truely made our honeymoon such a mememorable experience.

I couldn't fault The Legian in any possible way and highly recommend it to couples who want to have a relaxing holiday. We are certainly keen to come back for our first anniversary.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1795,Fantastic!,50,April 2009,"We went to Bali for 2.5weeks in April without booking for the last part of our stay. While staying at Villa Kipas (great place) we went on a tour of most hotels in Seminyak/Jimbaran looking for a place to stay. After reviewing many places (inc Four Seasons) we decided to stay at The Legian. And we were not dissapointed. We have been to many of the GHM hotels (inc Miami and Vietnam) and it compares very well to them although The Datai is still best.
The hotel was full but the service was still quite personal and attentive. We booked a 2brd apartment and it is an exellent choice for a family. It is true that the rooms are a bit hybrid and could be anywhere else but they are modern and the service remains 100% Balinese. Food is really good although breakfast can be a long wait. Location is great and you can walk to many places, esp good nearby restaurants. We ate at the Samaya and La Lucciola (both a dissapointment). We loved the Legian and will not hesitate to go back and enjoy the sunset while listening jazz or having a massage. We are missing it already!
Pros: location + service + beautiful ambience + perfect to watching the sunset in style
Cons: If hotel full, it can be a bit of a struggle to get a sunlounger, the beach in front is not the best part of Seminyak as the current is quite strong (go swim in front of the other hotel or close to Ku De Ta/Oberoi).",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1796,It just gets better and better ...,50,December 2008,"We passed through on our way to Australia for Christmas, from Europe. December is great in Bali unless you want to roast yourself a tan quick - it was never uncomfortably hot, but it didn't rain much (you can be unlucky they say, but in the three years we have been in Bali in December, we never have ...). This was our first time in Seminyak, which we loved. Not that we did much outside the hotel - we had an eight month old baby with us, and my parents tagged aling in the room next door as well. But what we liked about Seminyak was that it was good shopping, filtering out much of the trashy shopping of Kuta/Legian, leaving a good blend which we could easily find what we were looking for. But enough about that - it was the hotel which counted for us, and verery quickly we became thrilled with what we found - not from the start because the entrance isn't at all a take your breath away experience - but once you enter the room and settle in you quickly see what it is all about. All you read about the personal touch at this hotel is true - the babysitters which take your little one away so you can eat your breakfast in peace - the pool attendant who keeps an eye on your every need - the executive chef who drops over to your table every night, the staff who all know your name and your little preferences - pretty much everything works like clockwork. Which in Bali really is quite something. We dined more nights than the usual at the hotel restaurant which from a visual and chill out experience can't be beaten. Frankly, I've visited a few of the ""in places"" to dine out in the area and in my view the hotel dining is a better experience for the chill out factor, and it is not that much more than the trendies ooutside the hotel when it comes to the wallet. The food isn't amazingly good (although it is very good). The wine is expensive. But overall, it works brilliantly with the waves crashing in the distance and the outdoor setting a dream. And the staff make it a real joy. Where it is worth going out are the more cheaper but excellent value places - I can't remember the name but we ate very good freshly made pasta which was significantly better than most of the pasta dishes I am served in goodish Italian restaurants in Europe (outside Italy, of course) and for value, laughably good. But in my view Koo-de-tah (or however they want to spell it) and its equally trendy spots is for those staying in cheaper hotels who want the fine dining beach experience, not for those already in a fine hotel on the beach and have it all a hundred metres from their rooms, but without the hundreds of other guests alongside. All in all, financial crisis or not, this place merits your attention, and your hard earned dollars, if, that is, you want a totally chilled out small hotel feeling, in a haven of tranquility far enough away from the hustle of the masses (who you are trying to avoid). The only other comment I would make is that although we didn't see the Club area, I understand it is without direct view/access to the beach. On that basis, our deluxe room ground floor with the beach in front of us can't be beaten. There's something to having the beach rumbling away just in front of you morning, noon and night. It is an experience I sorely miss living in Europe (and with real estate prices beachside in Oz these days, probably will have to accept I won't get there ever again). The Club may offer me many things, but (especially with our bubs, but even without I would surely feel the same) the fact that we could walk to the pool and the beach (although it isn't much of an attraction when you actually set foot on it) in one minute, plus the fact that we could smell the beach air (that was not affected by the visual detritus, I am glad to report), and sit on our terrace or even better walk to our covered pagoda covered beach-side bed and return without a second thought, made it better than I could imagine anywhere else. There may well be other places equal in Bali, but for what we paid, this place gives us enough reasons to not bother searching for another - we're happy with what we found.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1797,TotalLuxury,50,August 2008,"We stayed at the Legian for 5 nights out of our 9 night visit to Bali and it was the best hotel for overall experience. The staff were friendly and the pool staff new our names from day one which i thought was a nice touch.

The rooms were huge and loved the four poster bed with white curtains around it which was very romantic. We had breakfast brought to our room every morning and had this out on our massive balcony overlooking the ocean. The day bed out on the balcony was a great touch as well, but by mid morning is was too hot & humid to sit out there. The bose sound system & ipod docks were great, they even give you an ipod to listen to during your stay which had some fantasic music downloaded.

The pool was divine with 2 infinity edge pools we were always able to get pool beds close by and you overlook the beach which is quite entertaining watching surfers being dumped by the waves - kept my fiance happy!

I would definitely recommend this hotel it is fantastic.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1798,Loved the Legian,50,June 2008,"We stayed at The Legian Bali to attend a friend's wedding at Four Seasons, Sayan. Had 3 nights at the Legian, then travelled to Ubud for two nights at the Four Seasons, then back to the Legian for another 3 nights. As we booked via a travel agent I am not exactly sure how much we paid for the room but it seems to be around USD700 for a Deluxe Suite.

After being picked up at the airport, we arrived at the hotel to be greeted with a complimentary fruit mocktail, absolutely delicious. The check in experience was excellent with the staff leading us to comfortable chairs to enjoy our drinks and bring the forms to us for completion they were very attentive (very different to any Australian hotel I have been too, where you usually have to stand in line waiting for someone to serve you). That first night we arrived in the evening and decided to have a drink at the bar, the hotel arranged a baby sitter at very short notice, the babysitter was very nice and came over every day for a few hours so we could do some shopping and head out at night, she was excellent.

Hotel breakfast was amazing each morning, I would gorge myself and not need anything else until the afternoon. They had both western and asian breakfast buffet. The Nasi Goreng at breakfast there was better than anything I have been able to find back in Perth.

The room was huge, with a small kitchette which came in handy so we could prepare food for our daughter. Had an excellent view from our balcony.

They have a heap of sun lounges near the pool and overlooking the beach, but get down early to snare a prime position.

The only problem we had with the hotel was the second time we checked in we ended up with a room at the opposite end that we originally had and found that this area had a heap of mosquitoes.

Overall, the hotel was amazing, staff excellent and attentive, they all knew our names, close to the beach, breakfast was unreal. Generally was a really good stay, defineately will stay again once the aussie dollar picks up a bit moreso i can afford the accomodation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1799,Rate it but can't rave about it,40,January 2009,"My wife and I returned today from 8 nights at the Legian, preceded by 7 nights at their sister hotel, the Chedi Club in Ubud.

The Legian is a very well run hotel and you would have to be outrageously spoiled not to have a great time here. The service is outstanding; the staff memorise the names of all the guests and are friendly and efficient and actually seem to enjoy working there, and the manager greeted us on arrival. We booked the cheapest room, which was very large and nicely, if unimaginatively, decorated. We did wonder why for such a large room the bed was only queen size. We also had some problem with the air-conditioning which they did fix quickly, but it failed again on the last night. The food was also good; the breakfast buffet was extensive and top quality. Dinner was also good but relatively expensive and the restaurant wasn’t very full. Also to be fair the rates are very affordable, at least by Western standards, and we felt it was good value for money.

In fact there is very little to criticise. However, albeit for reasons not all within its control, we rate the Legian highly but can’t rave about it. Firstly while they clean the stretch of beach in front of the hotel, you don’t have to walk very far to see litter and dead fish strewn everywhere; a problem which apparently is particularly acute in rainy season. Needless to say the ocean, if you are brave enough to swim in due to the waves and currents, isn't clean. The pools are well maintained but too small for a hotel with 67 rooms, and not deep enough to really swim in. Note that Dec/Jan is rainy season, and most days it would rain, although fortunately usually in the evening and at night when it didn't matter and there was ample sunshine during 6 of the 8 days. They provide afternoon tea, a nice touch, except the cakes that accompany it are sub-standard. The hotel has a huge security presence which is a sad necessity, and while we never felt unsafe in Bali, it can make you feel skittish.

Most of all was a sense that for a small hotel it just doesn't feel very exclusive, and could be almost anywhere in the world. The architecture, decor, food, and general ambience feel like a generic luxury international beach hotel not an Asian let alone Balinese experience. The hotel attracts an eclectic clientelle including older men in speedo's with wives a fraction of their ages, ""fashionistas"" who walk around like they are being filmed, Antipodean families who can't control their volume, and a significant contingent of gay couples.

For this reason we would strongly recommend combining a stay at the Legian with a stay at the sister hotel, the Chedi club in Ubud which we can't recommend highly enough. While it is only 40km away, it is a completely different experience, and made for a really well balanced holiday.

Outside the hotel, the food was also excellent. We went out to eat on 7 nights. One restaurant we thought was exceptional (and we are avid foodies) was Sarong, which needs to be booked well in advance in high season. We loved it so much we actually went back a couple of nights later. We had 2 courses and shared dessert, and the food bill was only around $US 65, but note the wine in Indonesia is expensive and this was no exception, the cheapest wines starting at around $50. Also good at the pricey end of the scale were Kafe Warisan and Living room, and at the inexpensive end of the scale is Made's Warung ($50 for a huge amount of food and the local ""Hatten"" Rose wine which is very drinkable).

Reviews are always coloured by people's expectations and personal tastes and preferences and mine is no different. Altogether we enjoyed the Legian but if you want more of a travelling experience and less of a “scene”, or want to immerse yourself in Balinese culture, or expect an idyllic tropical beach, this isn’t the place for you. If you want a 100% reliable luxury hotel with great service, and where you can just relax and eat well for a few days then you can’t fail to have a good time.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1800,Average,30,January 2009,"Stayed at the Legian, after spending three nights at Chedi Club at Tanah Gajah. The stay at Legian proved to be quite a disappointment.

The Bad
The rooms are extremely dated and old. The water pressure in the shower was extremely low. The ground floor door could not be locked (had to call them to fix it, for security reasons). Musky smell. Do not eat the Sate Club across the street. It was recommended by the receptionist. The prices are exorbitant.

The Good
The beach (simply fantastic). That is the best part of the hotel. It has got fantastic views at sunset. Most people had to go to Ku De Ta to look at the sunset, I did mine on the bed facing the beach, with a bottle of Moet (Rose). That was priceless. The food (yummy). The staff at the restaurant/pool area (attentive).

I guess part of the disappointment was that I came to Legian after spending three nights at the Chedi Club. The service standards/amenities/benefits of the two hotels are world's apart.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1801,Top Class!,50,June 2008,"We stayed at The Legian for five days in June while on our honeymoon to Bali. We had arranged hotel transport to pick us up from the airport. After a short, comfortable journey from airport to the hotel, the hotel staff checked us in efficiently while we enjoyed a welcome drink in the lobby. The Legian was impressive in looks as well as service right from these first few minutes. We were shown to our spacious suite (we had booked a superior suite) to be welcomed with a honeymoon cake and champagne. The hotel staff obliged our request for a top floor suite since it was our honeymoon and we had made the request in advance.

The suite: Truly superior, it had a huge hall, a mini kitchen, spacious bedroom, bath-tub and above all, a wide balcony with a stunning view! Be it daytime when you could spend hours on the day-bed listening to the sea and enjoying the view of the beach, or night time spent lying on the bed staring at the moon and the stars. The room came well-equipped with ipods attachable to stereo speakers, a CD-player with preloaded CDs and a wide LCD TV. DVD player is provided upon request. Bed is comfortable (four poster bed in superior and deluxe suites), kitchen and mini-bar well-equipped, chairs and sofa is comfy. The only complaint we had with the room was the leaky and noisy faucets, something not expected of a 5-star hotel.

Hotel premises: Unique, classy, antiquated look due to extensive stone-facing. Small ponds with lotuses dot the premises. Not too big so easy to explore and yet not crowded at all. Overall we found it quite charming. A large and well-equipped gym. Well-manicured lawns.

Service: Our request to install DVD player was attended to in minutes. There was a slight problem with ipod (loose connx) that was attended to in a jiffy. We could not find DVD list in our room, so the staff came to show us and ask what DVD we wanted to watch. Simple things like electric converters, iron/iron board were attended to with lightening speed. Never once did we have to wait for long for any request. All the staff seemed genuinely willing to assist in whichever way possible! One small issue we had was that we never got a particular DVD that we requested- although it was listed as 'available' in the hotel collection, the staff admitted at the end that they could not trace it. But this small thing does not affect in any way the huge positive impression made by the staff and their service.

Food: We only tried breakfast. On all days we enjoyed it by the poolside with a great view of the sea. The buffet selection is wide and of top quality; they also serve made-to-order items at your table.

Beach and View: All suites have sea view. The beach itself is good, though not the best in Bali. We found it clean and very few hawkers near The Legian. One can walk along the beach and pass other beach-facing hotels and restaurants like The Oberoi, Ku De Ta, etc.

Location: Located towards one end of Jln Laksmana, the hotel is not far from a number of excellent restaurants. One can take a short cab ride to these restaurants or just walk for 10-15 min to get there. Walking distance from Ku De Ta. Actually you might as well watch a lovely sunset from your suite while sipping cocktails, instead of heading to an expensive restaurant with a view!

Verdict: The Legian is Top class. It is worth every premium dollar you pay. We would definitely recommend, and love to go back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1802,Perfect Hotel...You must go!,50,May 2008,"We stayed in at The Legian (pronounced Lee-gyan) in May 2008! Our stay was amazing I loved every single moment it!

Upon arrival we were given a very tasty welcome drink, and also one of the hotels senior managers came over to us to welcome us personally etc.

Taken to our room, via a short tour of the grounds my husband and I were already in love with the place – the sea view is amazing!

Our first room was great, big and airy, great big bed, lovely bathroom (you can ask the hotel to come run your baths for you – with added extras such as petals, oils etc if it tickles your fancy…) and great shower. The view was spectacular and we could hear the ocean all night which was wonderful.

Champagne and treats upon arrival were a nice touch. Also throughout our stay the fruit and treats were great! As was the room beach bag which came in very handy!

The other reviews talk about the sound system, but it was great as we could also put our on I-Pod into the Bosse system! We also used the DVD library one night!

We did have some small problems with our room, but we were due to our issues upgraded into a suite (kitchen, dining room, living room, four poster bed, and MASSIVE bathroom. Also we were given a complimentary dinner in the hotel restaurant, treated to a free bottle of wine one day it was waiting for me when we got back into the room and when we left a book and more apologies!

The staff were wonderful, they remembered who you were, at breakfast, they remembered where you liked to sit, whether we drank tea/coffee etc. Also at the pool the staff were absolutely great, as soon as you got to the beach beds, the attendant would be there with water, refreshing cooling spray and towels etc.

The food in the hotel was great, expensive for lunch in terms of outside the hotel you could get food much cheaper but worth it any way! We did try some surrounding restaurants of which there were plenty and had some great 5* quality food & Cocktails!

The hotel amenities were great the infinity pool and free afternoon Tea in the pool bar were lovely touches!

I also loved the turn down service and again the staff were too lovely for words.

I really could go on and on about our stay in Bali the hotel really did make it, and to be honest we didn’t leave it much as we loved it so much! I would definitely recommend to anyone as noticed that guests with Children were just as welcome and kids had a great time!

When we got back home we got a hand written card thanking us for our stay a perfect touch to a perfect holiday!

If reading these reviews trying to decide on whether or not to stay at The Legian, don’t think no more BOOK NOW it wont disappoint you!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1803,Perfect honeymoon (Part 1) at the Legian,50,October 2008,"We'd both been looking forward to our honeymoon in Bali since our wedding in July. We'd booked 10 nights at the Legian and then 4 nights at the sister hotel in Ubud, the Chedi Club (also reviewed seperately).

From the moment we stepped off the plane and were greeted by the Legian's representative ""Hello Mr & Mrs Lock, welcome to Bali"" to the moment we checked out, we had such a wonderful time at the Legian.

The hotel itself was superb, from it's architecture which at night, looked like some temple from an Indiana Jones film to it's elegant luxory - our suite (113) was unbelieveable, all colonial, dark wood with marvellous facilities and a superb balcony overlooking the rear grounds, the beach and the crashing waves of the Indian Ocean.

The four posted bed was luxorious and very comfy and the bathroom was amazing. When we were taken up to our room upon arrival, we were greeted by a bottle of champagne, a cake and a card congratulating us on getting married and a frangipani petal laced bath had been run for us.

A Bose CD player with chillout cd's was standard in the room as was a Bose speaker system with two ipods, for our own personal use.

The service was outstanding - when we arrived, everyone knew our names and welcomed us with open arms and wide smiles and nothing was too much trouble. They booked restaurants, they booked taxi's, they made up or moved our sun loungers, they even brought in a relatives video camera after we'd enquired if we could get one from somewhere for a couple of days - without being too invasive.

The infinity pool was wondrous with fantastic views of the beach and was a great place to watch the sun set, the beach outside the hotel was kept amazingly clean on a daily basis despite the rest of the Seminyak to Kuta sweep of beach being very dirty, the restaurant and lunch bar served some lovely meals at a cost that might be slightly high but certainly not unreasonable given where we stayed.

A previous reviewer has complained of noise from the nearby bar; Ku De Ta (a 10 minute walk away) but the only sounds we could hear were the sounds of the waves crashing on the beach.

In short, this was simply the most amazing hotel (until we went to the Chedi Club) we'd stayed at and that list includes the Oberoi and Leela Palace in Bangalore and the Mumbai Hilton and we were very, very sad to leave.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1804,Legian Club is a bliss,50,October 2008,"We stayed at the Legian Club for a week at the beginning of a Bali trip. It is located behind the Legian Hotel (and next door to the Samaya), just a 30sec. walk over the street. Like in most GHM properties, many things are free of charge (laundry, mini-bar). But the Legian Club also had a restaurant-lounge, where all drinks were free (we drunk out the red house wine, it was finished the last day...) and they serve free canapees, bakery ect, very pleasant. Personal butler was very special, ours (Raditá) was one of the best we ever had. Also our 4-years daughter, which is usually very shy, loved him from the 2nd day. Only negative was the not-changing menu in the Club restaurant, where we ended eating each day because of the free wine. Spoken to the manager, he promised too change this.
Beach is great, a little away from the crowds, big waves and fantastic sunsets; beach service was also great. Spa is fantastic, over the expectations. All in all the Legian Club is highly recommended to those who want a lot of privacy (each villa is absolute secluded) and pampering (butler, pool, lobby). The main hotel - half the price of the club (and looks a bit like the Lemuria/Seychelles) - is a good choice for those who love the ocean views from the room and don´t mind not to live in separate villas.
All in all the Legian it is a grat choice, but dont forget to move to other places in the ""real Bali"" (e.g. Matahari Beach/Permutaran, Chedi Club/Ubud or Amankila. For beginning or ending of a Bali trip we would absolutely come back.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1805,Great stay,40,September 2008,"Nice clean hotel. They were supposed to pick us up at the airport but had to catch a cab there instead.

Hotel is very modern with wi-fi available in many areas including our room. Room itself was spacious enough, but bathroom is very TINY but clean as well. Closet is also vry TINY.

Pictures by other reviewers are accurate. Pool is nice but shallow.

Breakfast buffet is great.

Overall a great value and would definitely stay there again.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1806,The Legian is the best resort ever....,50,August 2008,"My 1st trip to Bali and got to stay at the best resort on the Island! It was awesome in everyway. The staff where excellent and attention to detail was wondeful. Our room was amazing, very roomy and comfortable. Cleaned beautifully everyday. I would find it hard to stay anywhere else when I return to Bali which I intend to do as soon as I save enough!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1807,Wonderful romantic hotel,50,June 2008,"Stayed here as the second part of my honeymoon, what a wonderful hotel. Upon arrival the staff upgraded us to a huge suite which was lovely. The suite itself had beautiful furniture, we particularly likes the voile curtains around the bed, Very romantic!
The hotel facilities were very good, we used the spa and found it to be very relaxing.
We spent every day lounging on the huge bed like sun loungers on the beach - the hawkers can be a bit irritating but the security at the hotel soon move them on if they become a nuisance.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1808,Hotel Par Excellence,50,September 2008,"My wife and i stayed at this hotel from 9 to 18 September and could not speak more highly of the quality of the hotel, the attention to detail,the level of service and the absolutely excellent staff.
If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing break in first class surrounds we could not recommend a better place in Bali.
The hotel runs a free shuttle service to Kouta and there are many good restaurants within walking distance ie 10 to 15 mins BUT watch the prices as $100 plus Australian for 2 is common and wines are expensive on top of that.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1809,It doesn't get better than this!,50,September 2008,"Our fourth stay at this hotel and everytime it gets better. Staff excellent from housekeeping to restaurant. Rooms renovated and now with new flat screen tvs.
If you want to tour the island at a reasonable price and safely with polite english speaking driver in air conditioned car then ask for local transport and driver Sami at the hotel reception.
Plenty of good restaurants near hotel but the best for Indian food fanactics is Gateway of India in Jalan Dana Purain in Seminyak (only a 1Euro taxi ride from hotel)
We are already planning the next visit.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1810,Very good hotel!,40,August 2008,"Located in the middle of Seminyak, surrounded by other hotels, clubs etc - and this is one of the only downsides: you are not in a quiet area here, you can here the KuDeTa music and other noise....but if you like fun around you then you are fine here!

The hotel has great rooms, large, nice decoration, staff is very attentive and helpful, and the manager is always around asking you if you need anything - very appreciated!
Food is good.

The garden and pool is nice, but on the smaller side, as you have your sunchair next to each other, so not much privacy - but again you come here for fun, otherwise you go to other parts of Bali!

Very good hotel, would definitely come back if I was looking for fun!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1811,Just perfect,50,January 2008,"We stayed one week at this beautiful Hotel .....we were one week looking around for a Hotel in Bali and we found the best Hotel of BALI. Pity that we lost one week of our Holidays but we prefer to look around before booking an expensive package trip and be dissapointed.
We stayed at room 333 with a fantastic view and a fantastic service.The room ( was a suite like all the rooms) big ,very big,the biggest i ever had.
I recommend this Hotel to everybody(singles and couples) cause its so beautiful
but dont book the club its behind the main building and has no view.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1812,"Wow, Beach House!",50,July 2008,"We had a wonderful time in Legian. We spent one night at their superior one bedroom suite which was so spacious and with a stunning ocean view. The we moved to the beach house and stayed 3 nigths there. The beach house was perfect in everyway, so romantic yet so convenient. We had our private infinity pool and private ocean access, and two very friendly butlers. On my husband's birthday, they lit up candles and put rose pedals all over the villa, and arranged private balanese dance and music for us. We were truely treated as royalties. It was pricey, but it really worthed it. We enjoyed our stay so much and would recommend the beach house to everybody.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1813,perfect hotel with true style,50,April 2008,"The Legian is a hotel that has a true, natural style and class rarely found today with so many new places trying to be ""hip"". The design is contemporary and balinese without being overstyled or tacky. The staff is 100% professionally trained, genuinely friendly, unintrusive, and never give the impression of being after a tip. The food is excellent, both local and western, very diverse and among the best ever had in many hotels in Bali. The only negative thing that can be said is that some details in the rooms are slightly worn and in need of updating -- the hotel is starting to show its age. But this still somehow adds to the character.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1814,Great Rating for the Legian,40,July 2007,"The Legian - Bali is an outstanding hotel --- the room, the accomodations, the staff were exceptional.

I was travelling solo in Bali for the week and the hotel staff went out of their way to welcome me and ensure my comfort.

The room was beautifully understated --- lovely Balinese/Asian style with a veranda complete with teak furniture -- table, chairs, chaise loungues. Spa style bathroom with full amenities. There was also a small kitchenette stocked with tea, coffee, drinks and snacks, a fridge.

For starters, I was greeted at the airport by their driver, who had cold water and chilled towels to refresh me after my flight. When I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted with a fresh fruit cocktail, additional chilled facial towels while I was checked in.

I had a private suite on the ground floor -- in a private corner by lovely water gardens overlooking a temple. When I entered the room, the staff had lit incense and had some lovely Balinese- style new age music playing. They had set up a tray of fresh sushi, fresh fruits along with a iced bucket of champagne. I was impressed and to tell the truth, sorry that I had only myself to enjoy the experience with. The fruit basket was replenished daily with jack fruit, snake fruit, bananas, passion fruits ...

The grounds were equally lovely, as was the spa (though quite expensive --- you would do better to go to the local spas in Seminyak --- they are excellent, clean and inexpensive. That said, you can't beat the convenience of the on site spa and their staff is excellent.

The food was fantastic --- I skipped the am brunch and asked the staff to prepare Balinese dishes for me -- I was delighted with the food. I had martabak --- it's almost like an egg strudel --- thin layers of seasoned eggs in won ton type wrappers; each day the staff prepared a special dish for me.

The staff respected my privacy and at the same time went out of their way to socialize --- I think they were a bit perplexed as to why I was travelling alone --- and maybe felt a bit sorry for me.

The Legian is right on the beach and it is a spectacular beach. It's easy to go horseback riding, rent surf boards, boogie boards, etc there. Also wonderful for simply walking the beach or going for a swim -- though the surf is very strong there. Outside the Ku-De-Tah (next door restaurant/bar) there is usually a surf line up. Even if you don't surf -- its fun to watch the others catching the waves.

So, if there were any negatives, it would be that the Legian could be a bit sedate --- the other guests were families, couples and not very sociable or inclined to conversations. I travel extensively by myself and usually meet people to dine with or for drinks --- not the case here. The lounge at the Legian was very quiet as was the ocean side bar. That said, the ocean side bar had beautiful sunsets.

I would definitely recommend the Legian for couples and even families, also for solo travellers who enjoy privacy, rest & relaxation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1815,Great villas in Seminyak,50,March 2007,"It's an expensive hotel but it's so private and so beautifully appointed you can't be disappointed by this very special property.
Located directly opposite of The Legian, the sister property i don't especially like even if the veiw is ten times better, The Club at The Legian is a very small resort of only 11 villas with pool and a large pavillion where you can have a drink or take a nice and delicious lunch by the large pool resort.
But if you decide to stay in this resort, it's mainly for privacy because each villa is secluded in a nice garden with a 10 meters pool and a very comfy day pavillion for private dinners or breakfast. You'll have the advantage to have a private butler, always available on call and the staff is really nice and helpful. It's one of the best service i've had the chance to experience in an hotel.
The layout of the villa is excellent with a small sitting area with a Bose entertainment system; a large bedroom with an impressive bed and a bathroom with twin vanities, a rain shower and on a wood deck a very sexy bathtub. All the doors of the villa can be open for an airy house with direct connexion between inside and outside.
About the decoration, it's simply amazing and very original and you'll feel so relaxing and cool in every space of your private villa and garden you'll want to stay here for lifetime.
Moreover, you'll have all the advantages of a ""club lounge"" with complimentary minibar with a good selections of soft and alcoholic drinks, a bottle of sparkling wine on arrival, a selection of CD, DVD and games in your room, a complimentary unlimited laundry and complimentary cocktails and canapés on the evening.
You'll have no view on the sea but an access to The Legian for the view and the beach leisures is always possible; You'll pay no less than 650 US$ per night but you'll never forget this fantastic experience and if i have to return back to Seminyak, i'll always choose this ultra fashionnable and excellent resort even if i don't like the management...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1816,"Fabuolus People & Great Location, Just As I Imagined",50,July 2007,"This hotel & its staff are just wonderful. I took my parents, my father was sick, i did not know if he would make it. So i wanted
this trip to be soooo perfect as i migh not get another shot.

I am not wealthy, but i splashed out on this hotel & it was worth every single penny. The staff are so genuinely warm & welcoming. The room actually it was a huge suite, bigger than my home, was on the ocean front! It was simple heaven.

Breakfast is amazing & its was simply breathless. It took me a while to just believe it was so wonderful.

I know holidays are expensive, so please trust me you will NOT to disappointed. If you have any concerns please email me with a telephone numbers & i can tell you more. I will also ne more than happy to send you pics as for reason i cannot upload them on this website!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1817,Legian Bali,50,December 2007,"We Stayed in the Legian Bali Beginning of December 07. Don't confuse the Legian Bali with the Legian Beach Hotel big mistake. The Legain is a 3 story building. The view is really partial ocean view because of some trees but no big deal. My wife and i were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite which was huge. The only TV is in the living room and it's smaller at that... No T.V. in bedrooms but the cable TV does have some English speaking channels. I complained about the early morning sun coming into the bedroom through the venetian Blinds (because of my jet lag and time changes). In 30 minutes maintenance was in our room placed a heavy curtain over the slated or venetian blinds- great service!!! The breakfast (make sure it's included in your rate) is unbelievable you'll try wonderful different foods and you'll probably be about to skip lunch. The spa (massages) is great and reasonable, yes you can go Body Works Spa around the corner for 1/2 the cost. The concierge- Jay Wijaya is excellent he arranged everything perfectly. The food at the Legian for dinner was beautiful with the torches and the moon light reflecting off the pools. The restaurant Ku De Ta (KDT) is a 5 minute walk its crowded but 1/2 the price of the Legian. Other restaurants to consider are La Luciola, Biossom, Mozaic but nothing is going to beat the Sanitary conditions of the Legian. A few guest inferred they got ""Bali Belly"" eating at some of the Local eateries. The second half of the trip we stayed in the Legian club across the street ( not beach front). In the private villas with your own butler, concierge, musicians, private pool, free happy hours, breakfast, alcohols, champagne a car with a driver!!! The villas at the club are very Romantic with no detail excluded. On our 25th wedding anniversary a large cake was provided with rose petals bath for two and candles throughout the villa and more champagne all at no charge. The Oberoi is 2 minute walk along the beach. We looked at it and it's all villas were as the Legian is a hight rise (3stories). The Oberoi is beautiful too but the beach front pool and patio area at the Legion is really nice. Both Hotels sit on the same long wide black sandy beach. You really couldn't go wrong with staying at either the Oberoi or Legian. Keep in mind the villas roofs at the Oberoi are thatch or straw. Just research the hotel you are staying at. If you stay at the Four Seasons in Kuta on Jimbaron Bay you get to hear and see jets take off daily till 8 pm. The Rite-Carlton is on a high cliff and has steep steps down to a small beach and so on. In the market areas usually they want 1/2 the price they initially offer?? They do bargain!! One last note we bought beautiful wood carvings decided to ship the three statues back along with our scuba gear. UPS quoted $1100 and DHL quoted $700. So you go with DHL, Right. When I get home, DHL says there are some additional charges for Fumigation, wood crating, custom fees for a total of $1200. The three statues were only worth $146 but they have our scuba gear worth $4000 also, so you pay what they want. Followed up a trip with three nights stay in Singapore at the Raffles Hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1818,faultless!,50,December 2007,"3rd time at the club, and again couldn't find anything to fault. Our Butler Rabika was attentive, helpful and ensured we were well taken care of across the island.

1819,wow what an amazing hotel,50,November 2007,"Just come back from the mosy idyllic stay at The Legian. All the prior raving reviews were right. It has the best service I have had at any hotel around the world. Nice little touches that other hotels get so wrong. The staff are impeccible. The hotel was prefectly situated so that you could get to all the restaurants and bars in a very short cab trip. Super chilled and just about the best stay I have ever had. I can't reccomend it enough. To those who have said they didn't like their stay I just can't believe they went tothe right hotel.

If you are thinking of going...think no more... just book it...you'll love it.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1820,Great place but a bit of updating would do wonders,40,November 2007,"Stayed here for four nights in October/November and loved every minute of it. We stayed in room 131 which offers a full beach/ocean view. In fact, this room must have the best view as it opens up to two sides and is situated on the top floor.

The room was a huge one bed-room deluxe suite which was extremely comfortable. Two terraces, two toilets, a kitchenette, big bathroom with separate shower, a dining table etc. The tiny boxy TV and dated furniture and bathroom show that the place wasn't built yesterday but we still liked it a lot. We were told that a refurbishment is planned in 2008. The wooden blinds don't keep the light out in the morning so if you are used to sleep in a dark room you will wake up with the sun.

The public areas (corridors, reception, bar etc.) also look rather dated and could use an update especially compared with all the new and trendy places with are quickly rising in the Semyniak area.

However, the beach-front and central location can't be beaten and the day beds hanging over the beach are simply wonderful.

The breakfast buffet was OK but we have had better elsewhere, for instance at Ritz-Carlton Jimbaran.

The gym isn't large but it offers sufficient possibilities for a short stay.

In general, it's a great hotel with great service but a bit of updating would make the place better. We would return without hesitation.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1821,"Simply; ""Outstanding""!!!!!",50,September 2007,"We spent 10 nights of our honeymoon at the Legian (18th-28th Sept 07), and I can sum it up in one word, ""outstanding"". I picked the Legian after careful research, and it was worth it. The hotel is in a great position, and as with other reviews on here, room, pools, layout, beach etc, all to a modern 5* standard.
The difference with the Legian though, what makes it so much better than other 5* hotels, is the staff. They couldn't do enough for you. There was loads of staff, but managed to be almost invisiable, unless you needed anything and then they were immediately attentive, constantly smiling, and they all make an effort to know your name. It didn't matter who you spoke to, they would book restaurants, take drinks orders, whatever you needed. And always with a beaming smile. The staff really set this hotel aprt from other 5* hotels.
As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel provides a list of recommended restaurants, and every one was excellent, with most just a short walk away.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough, from the ipods in your room (including the BOSE ipod stereo), to the spa (heaven!), the intimate dining (a must!), the infinity pools, the beds overhanging the beach, the Bali BBQ, the little gift in your room each night, but most of all, the staff. They really made the difference!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1822,Fabulous position!,50,October 2007,"Am waiting at HongKong airport having just left Bali and wanted to leave a review of this fantastic hotel. It was partly chosen after reading all the excellent reports and they were all borne out. We stayed at the Legian for 10 nights breaking it up for 2 nights to stay in Ubud which made a nice contrast. The staff and service are amazing without being intrusive, the rooms are very confortable and well designed, in fact everything has been well thought out and all your needs catered for! What I particularly liked was the fact that you could eat out at a different restaurant every night (Kudeta, Breeze, The Living Room, Lucciolas, L'ultima) and walk to most . The shopping was amazing, with boutiques, jewellery, handicrafts a short and very reasonable taxi ride away or walking 20 min if you can stand the heat! The beach was perfect for long walks and bodyboarding. The hotel also arranged for a two hour horse ride at Umalas which included one hour on the beach which I would recommend, lovely horses and superb stables. The Spa was great, the breakfasts were incredible and I will miss the water melon juices and crispy bacon overlooking the infinity pool and pounding surf! The lighting in the bathrooms could be a bit brighter but apparently they are going to make some improvements in the new year. We loved Bali, this hotel, and will definitely return.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1823,As promised...,50,September 2007,"Stayed for a week (Sept 21st - 28th 2007 ) as part of Asia honeymoon... and this hotel delivered.... we were looking for a chill out week after BKK and SIN and everything at the Legian was superb. I find it hard to comprehend the negative experience of the last post... perhaps if you have the right mind set then any small niggles seem unimportant...(or in fact are not even noticed...). We are experienced travellers, know what to look for, know what to expect relative to outlay and frankly the Legian was spot on. The staff were the most noticable asset... not only attentive and professional but naturally kind and friendly...the setting is imaculate, the food fautless...and the room was magical. We had been in suites in Oriental in BKK and Intercon in SIN but whilst smaller the suites at the Legian were asthetically better and totally relaxing. We are discreet guests and certainly not demanding but service at the Legian was second to none. Management was evident but not intrusive. Security was a comfort but not overbearing. No negatives at all (well, apart from the idiots who come to a haven like this and spend all day on mobile phones in restaurant and poolside...they look and sound so stupid...get a life...). Don't hesitate to visit this hotel...we are going back...",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1824,Disappointed,20,August 2007,"We stayed there for our honeymoon for a week from the end of July. We had chosen the hotel carefully as we had asked for somewhere relaxing and not very busy. Unfortunately the hotel was very busy and on a couple of occasions we couldn't even get a sunbed. The pool guys had to create beds for us on the lawn below the pool.

Our suite was big and having paid for a deluxe ocean view suite, that's what we thought we'd be getting. However, there were trees covering most of the view from our balcony, which was hugely disappointing. There always seemed to be something to fix in the room, twice the air conditioning packed up, the lights weren't working, the toilets didn't flush.

The only plus for this hotel was the amazing beach and its staff, who were excellent, very friendly and helpful. It's very overpriced and the restaurant isn't that great.

Having read all the great reviews on this site we thought it would be fantastic, but seem to have had a very bad experience. It's not something you need on your honeymoon.

We spent a night at the Oberoi Bali and that was so peaceful and relaxing we were kicking ourselves not to have spent the week there. (It was also a lot cheaper). The Legian looked like a busy hotel the moment we got there, with standard European hotel architecture.

We will not be returning to the Legian.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1825,Wonderful chill out experience,50,July 2007,"We stayed here 5 nights as part of a South East Asia 10 year Anniversary celebration. Our first surprise was that the management had upgraded us to a larger suite. This room was incredible: dining room, kitchenette, guest bath, living room, and huge private terrace. We never wanted to leave! It was perfect because a few nights after touring, we had room service at our dining table / just relaxed with a DVD in the living room on the couch (complimentary DVD library.)

Throughout the week we were given nice notes and a cake in celebration of our anniversary. If you are celebrating a special occasion, I highly recommend the 'intimate dinner' they can serve. You have a private dinner in a balinese gazebo overlooking the beach, with candles all around, and a private waiter. It is pretty incredible.

The manager came over and talked to us several times during the week, and all employees seemed to genuinely want to make the best possible experience for you.

The location is wonderful - private beach with waves to listen to all day and night. We 'tried' boogie boarding (highly recommend a 1 piece bathing suit ladies....) and it was great fun.

One interesting note - the hotel is pretty small and easy to find your way around, so you won't find annoying signs telling you this way to the restaurant, or here to the pool. So it feels like it is your place - you own it.

The spa was tops. I had a Legian experience, and a few others. When I had my manicure and pedicure, the spa manager came in to offer me an english magazine to read that had just came in.

When you check out, you can use a complimentary suite to shower and refresh. We found the food to be good. The french toast at breakfast is a must to try!

The only negative was there is not so much water pressure, particularly in the toliets. In the beginning I debated between this and the Obernai, and although I just walked by the Obernai beach side, it didn't seem to be as spectacular as Legian, so I was very happy with my choice!

This place has spoiled me forever!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1826,Lebian Ideal,50,June 2007,"I am not a fan of Bali nor beach side resorts, so a visit to Bali for a conference was not my actual preference. Fortunately we decided to stay at the The Legian (whilst the conference was held at the Sofitel.) The hotel delivers all that it says it will and I was suprised with the efficiancy of the staff, the politeness of the staff and the smooth manner in which the hotel operated. The rooms are excellent and truly large (mine had three balconies all overlooking the ocean.) The poolside area, access to the beach and other areas are all excellent. Staff eager to organise everything and responded efficiently to all requests. I found lazing at the pool with wireless internet connection a surprise that was helped along with great staff, chilled wine and friendly smiles. I would recommend the Legian to anyone - it truly delivers.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1827,Absolutely Fantastic!,50,April 2007,"We went to Bali for our honeymoon and selected the Legian based on the wonderful reviews we read on Trip Advisor and other sites. We were not disappointed in the least bit. The hotel is absolutely stunning and we were lucky that it was not very packed the 5 days we were there. It is located right on Seminyak beach which does not have a lot of tourists. It is minutes away from some great restaurants and a 5 min taxi ride to the wonderful restaurants & shops. The staff were wonderful, extremely helpful and always smiling. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable, modern and very large. The pool and grounds are stunning - pure relaxation. Every day you come back to your room to notes from staff along with a treat (dessert) or snack. I was sick our first few days and the hotel called a doctor for us, gave us food on the house and followed up daily to see how I was feeling. For those who are thinking of staying at the Club Legian, it is located across the road and we were actually shocked to see that the people who stay at these high-end villas have to cross the street to share the same amenities like the pool, restaurants etc with those staying at the Legian.
Everything you see on the website for the hotel is what you get - I always think that hotel websites show only the good but there are no misleading pictures. I would upload some of our pics but unfortunately they are all over 2MB.
The only downside to the Legian was the food - we ate dinner at the hotel the first 2 days and it was very disappointing. Not only do you pay 4 times the amount, but the food was not very good. You'll find much better food of the resort for a third of the price. Breakfast was the only meal where you were guaranteed to want more - a great selection and lots to choose from.

If we went back to Bali, we would stay at the Legian in a heartbeat.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1828,Loved it lots,50,June 2007,"My Wife & I have a small high pressure business in perth & after 3 years of no breaks decided for a 7 winter day break in Bali

I choose the legion because of its location to Kuta & and boutique status

It did not let me down the rooms were definatley 5 star without the pretentious western 5 star feel & the gardens were out of a designers magazine the service was terrific and the food sensational

We could walk along the beach to Kuta takes a good 3/4 hour
or 10 min to the great array of shops in seminyak

That sexy waterfront Bar Restaurant Ku de ta just down the road is a added bonus

Chilli crab night was ab fab shame we were not at the Hotel for the BBQ Seafood Night on the Friday ( next time)
The Day Spa was a lovely haven for my wife to chill out

The G.M introduced himself & thanked us for coming & made sure our stay was comfortable but he need not worry his loyal team looked after us like they had shares in the place

Great job guys & we will sing your praises from Perth W.A
Note : Ideal place for couples you get what you pay for and we will be back next time i need to destress.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1829,Best hotel ever..,50,February 2007,"Visited the Legian in Feb 07 - amazing hotel... great service, great location, fantastic room (deluxe suite) which had a wonderful view with a double bed on the balcony - great selection of toiletries.. even candles and incense.. They even provided a beach bag fur use during your stay ! The food was awesome - especially the breakfasts. The ambience is relaxed. Loved the double beds on the beach... and the complimentary water..

Really a luxurious gorgeous hotel.. Great for honeymooners, couples but child friendly..",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1830,"Excellent location, big beautiful suites",50,January 2007,"My husband and I visit Bali up to four times a year and this is the only hotel we stay at, and would choose to stay at.

The hotel is located beach front in the fashionable Seminyak area nestled between Ku de Ta, excellent tapa's food and cocktails, and La Lucciola another great Bali restaurant.

The rooms are massive. Levels 2 and three have ocean views. The hotel
is managed by a great team and all of the staff are more than capable
of organising anything you ask for, with a smile and graciousness that the Balinese possess. Being addressed each day at breakfast and the staff knowing what coffee you have is an added attention to detail you don't get in big Americanised hotels. The hotel spa is expensive but the treatments are worth that bit more than going to a local salon.

All of the cool restaurants and bars are within a ten minute radius.
Jalan Legian is 5 minutes away and has the best shopping in Bali. Get dropped off at the Bintang supermarket then head back the way you came to cover all of the good shops.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1831,Superb,50,October 2006,"Absolutely fantastic hotel with great panoramic view of the ocean. Excellent service and staff. Restaurant is not really exciting but there are more than enough (and a lot cheaper!) in the area including the most famous one KDT just around the corner. But really, the service was really the best part.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1832,great great time at the legian,50,August 2006,"We were lucky to stay 10 days with my 3 children in this exceptionnal hotel. The service was wonderful, discreet, efficient and first class. We will remember Mita who was so helpful and so charming with us. The rooms ( in fact suites ) have splendid view on the beach. We will definetely come back!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1833,Loved it,50,November 2006,"Excellent hotel, loved our stay in Nov 2005. Would definitely recommend.

Good bits: Good value for money $260. Amazing rooms (got a suite, can't remember which one), best I've ever stayed in, very sleek, huge, ipods, bose sound system, walk in shower & bath. Lovely pool. Great pool service with towels and water. Double loungers. Could borrow boogie boards. Good restaurants nearby.

Not so good. Rush for the shaded double loungers, seemingly kept in reserve by the pool boys. Pricey food. Beach not as good as Indian Ocean.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1834,"Great service, love the beach, the wave and the sunset",50,November 2006,"The Legian is definitely one of the best hotels I have ever stayed so far.... When we arrived, the staff directly served us with a very refreshing fresh fruit juice and cold towels, which was perfect for the hot weather. We had to wait for like an hour before the room was ready but we were not bored at all since we get to wait in the lounge where the beach was just lovely.....

We got the top floor room where you can get privacy with a great view of the sea. We got a welcome package which consist of fruits, delicous welcome snacks and flowers, what an excellent way to start a holiday.

The location is very strategic since you get to enjoy the civilisation (its walking distance to many good restaurant and cafes) and the quiet beach. We also went to Kuta to experience that famous place, but I really feel like going back to Seminyak since Kuta is really full of vendors offering loging, cars, etc.

I can never forget the beach and the wave and you also get to enjoy the fabulous sunset. There is a life guard and several security people who were very alert to keep the beach private. We play body surf everyday, the wave is just great, a surfer paradise. The two tier pool was perfection.

We also tried having dinner in the Legian restaurant and at that time we really want to try the satay which was only available for lunch but the chef was willing to cook it specially for us. Although the price was a bit on the high side comparing to the meal.

The massage is a must try, we took a package that consist The Legian Massage, body scrub, body mask, foot massage and flower bath... It was to die for.... I was so relaxed that I don't want to walk back to the hotel room. The Legian massage was done by 2 person massaging your body together and the foot massage was really enjoyable. The body mask was warm, unlike other place where the body mask is cold and u get to enjoy the flower bath after that. But the massage is something you have to try.

The concierge was really helpful and remember us by name, in fact most of the staff remember our names. The concierge also help us to book a car to Ubud, provide very good reccomendation of restaurants around the area. The service was excellent.

All and all.... it was a great stay and we will definitely come back there for holiday... After I came back to my country, I couldn't get use to waking up looking at walls instead of the sea and that I cannot see the sunset from my apartment.... It took me a week to get used to the fact that I am not at The Legian anymore.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1835,Loving Legian,50,December 2006,"We considered several other luxury hotels like Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton but finally decided on The Legianand we didn't regret it one single bit. Even my husband who is not the ""do nothing, just chill"" type has promised to be back!

Right from the moment we pulled up till the time we got into our cab, the service above all had been awesome. Staff was genuinely friendly and helpful without being in your face. Our bags (as did the canapes and champagne on ice) arrived almost as soon as we entered our rooms thus not leaving us hanging around, waiting to unpack. They were always happy to chat but know when to leave you. At the pool the staff was quick with the towels and the refreshing mist sprays. Glasses were consistently topped up with iced water.

Our huge and luxurious one bedroom deluxe suite was on the gound floor which meant that our 14 mth old daughter could run around on the lawn with us watching nearby. The suite's terrace had a daybed where we whiled our afternoons with a good book, a game of Scrabble and a glass in hand. Breakfasts were scrummy though we can't comment on the menu if one chose to dine in as we went to the nearby restaurants just within walking distance of the hotel.

It was my brithday on the last day of our stay and at breakfast, the staff came with a card, a cake and another bottle of champagne, so that was a really nice surprise!

On one of the days, we had ordered some pasta for our daughter and had found a tiny pice of metallic ""thread"" and brought this to the attention of the manager who promised to look into the matter. True enough, five minutes later, we received a call with bagloads of apologies from them saying that they found the ""thread"" to be part of the scouring pad and offered a 50% discount on one of our nights' stay. To be honest we were just very impressed that matters were dealt with very quickly and in our experience of 5* hotels, it is still hard to find a Legian-quality and level of service.

Our trip to Bali this time was not a sightseeing one; rather it was meant to be a totally relaxing retreat. And The Legian made it just that! Even with a toddler in tow!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1836,One of the Best Hotels I've Ever Stayed,50,October 2006,"My friend and I decided to head to Bali at the last minute in early Octobver 2006 after originally planning to go to Phuket. We originally wanted to stay at the Intercontinental at Jimabaran Beach given the reasonable price and all the great reviews. However, it was booked, so we decided to stay at The Legian which we had read about here. The Legian was also the top ranked hotel in Bali in our ""Luxe"" high end travel guide which we have relied on all over Asia (and it is rarely wrong).

The Legian exceeded all of our expectations. My friend and I had a two bedroom suite with a huge living room, kitchen, balcony and two enormous bathrooms. The beach was quiet and clean. the two-tiered pool was perfect. Weather was awesome for 6 straight days. Hotel service was top notch and as good as I have seen (with the possible exception of several hotels in Thailand). My friend and I had the best week of our lives in Bali and our experience at The Legian was a significant reason why.

The Legian is fairly quiet but that is what we were looking for after heading out on the town every night. I am not sure why anyone would stay anywhere else in Bali. Seminyak has the best restaurants and is most convenient to everything. The Legian is small but offers all the amenities of the more well known hotels. Paying three times as much to stay at the Four Seasons is just not worth it.

I've stayed all over the world in the nicest hotels and I can honestly say that The Legian was one of my favorites.

1837,Fantastic,50,October 2006,Everything about this hotel is wonderful. Best location in Bali. Beach is clean and beautiful. Hotel staff is nice and helpful. Can't say enough good things about the experience. Will definitely go back again.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1838,Chilled sophisticated,50,September 2006,"I stayed at this hotel while on business in Bali as my dealings were to be conducted only 10 minutes from the hotel. The overall experience and ambience is superb. Located on the beach with two splendid rim flow infinity edge pools which frame the sea view, this is a true slice of chic paradise. From the welcome iced champagne and fruit combo sushi to the most spacious rooms, decorated with first class modern mother of pearl, carefully honed tropical woods and terrazzo finishes. The ipod and Bose surround system with ghm's own CD music added a sublime touch. After a stressful business day I was able to chill with ipod, glass of wine on one of the beauftful benches placed on elevated plinths just above the beach while watching achingly beautiful sunsets.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1839,Legian lovely but boring!!,40,September 2006,"We stayed in the legian for 9 night s at the end of august. The Hotel itself is fabulous, very classy, we stayed in a deluxe suite which i have to say was amazing. We had fantastic balcony with the seaview somewhat obstructed by a big tree but still lovely. Food is the hotel was very nice but ridiculously over priced ""seriously"", reason for this i would imagine is because of the guests that stay there, in other words rich people ""apparantly models,fashion designers etc.""who don't mind spending serious money, every day by the pool because their to lazy to venture out of the hotel to actually see bali but i suppose different strokes for different folks personally i understand the concept of a relaxing holiday but i like to get out and about seen as i paid so much money to get there in the first place but yes.

Staff were fantastic waited on hand and foot, very polite fabulous manners. One major thing i would say is i thought there was absolutely no atmosphere in the hotel or poolside, really disappointing, everyone keeps to themselves basically no fun, which is always nice to have on your summer holiday, but we had great time on our own done the tours ""monkey forest a must"" , kudeta restaurant a must although bring your credit card cause its em pricey, bali itself wasn't that busy main reason is the bombs, peoplel afraid to come to bali but i'm sure in a year bali will be bustling with tourists again.

My advice if you ever make a trustworthy contact in bali and want to go back to stay in the legian ask them to book it locally apparently its cheap in comparison to what you would pay booking from abroad. Anyways we had fantastic time would recommend bali to anyone.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1840,Trendy Beach Hotel for Honeymooners,50,October 2006,"Probably one of the best beach hotels in Bali located the legian Beach. First class service all around. We stayed in the Deluxe Suite; however you can save some money by getting the Superior suite. I felt for Honeymooners the place we got was a little bit excessive, but I surely don't have any regrets; just look at my pictures.
The Spa was awesome; we did the Balinese Massage for 1.5 hrs for $65 a little bit pricey for Bali, but it was so good that it put my husband to sleep and he started snoring. I say pricey because we had a Balinese massage in Ubud from Zen Massage for 1.5 hrs; $11. Major difference. But the ambience and a snazzy place like The Legian I'll do the Balinese massage for $65 again. Actually we did it 3 times.
Food was excellent I have no complaints. Try to stay there for a Friday becuase they have the watch the sunset dinner; the set up was great and romantic. The Legian is also walking distance to another fine restaurant KU DE TA. I would rank this restaurant #2 next to Mozaic in Ubud.
The only thing the hotel lacked was a convenient shuttle service. The shuttle service comes every 2 hours, and you get dropped off and picked up at the most inconvenient place, the Duty Free Shops. I do not really care for Duty Free Shops. Some hotels have their own personal 24hr taxi service. Internet service is not free. the charge is $20 for a 24hr service and also if you don't have a laptop you'll need to rent one for $20 too. These are just minor complaints.
Overall I will stay again at The Legian. Keep in mind there is also Legian Beach Hotel; don't get them mixed up.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1841,Great honeymoon,50,June 2006,"We spent 4 nights int his hotel during our honeymoon trip in Bali in june 2006.
We really loved this hotel as it is peaceful, very comfy and everyone there is very friendly. The location is lovely on a desert beach. The hotel complex is not very big neither the garden but very well protected from outside. You won't be bothered when sunbathing by the pools or on the beach.
The room is gorgeous. We had a studio room which is big enough ! large bed and a living room with sofas. You also have access from the living room and bathroom to 2 terraces with sunbathing chairs.
The bathroom is wonderful with roomy shower and bath. A kitchen hosts the mini bar, fridge, ice, glasses, cofee machine.
The newspaper is delivered daily and discrete staff will prepare your room in the evening for the night.
We were pleased with delicate attentions for our honeymoon (words, cake, flowers, cocktails...)
Restaurant is good but quite pricey. The hotel is located near Kudeta bar for sunset cocktails and ""eat street"" where you will find many very good restaurants (caution, book in advance during peak season) !. Just pick a cab at the lounge for a 2min ride and a dollar.
You can't swim on this beach as waves are dangerous; only surfers will.
Staff is very pleasant and were asking us if we needed something several times a day. We were served refreshments by the pool recycled many times during the afternoon.
Access to internet is possible in the hotel : you have to rent a laptop (hour or day) and wireless access.
I will definitely go back to the Legian for the pleasure of quietness and luxury. June is perfect as there was not much customers.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1842,Impeccable!,50,July 2006,"Absolutely stunning! We booked this hotel for our honeymoon.
Service:·
Impeccable. We could not fault it. We were referred to by our names from the time we checked it. Nothing was too much trouble and the attention to detail was incredible. We were provided home made desserts/sweets every evening and selection of fruits every morning. ·
Room:
Beautiful. We were booked into the deluxe suite with a separate lounge, dinning room, balcony, bedroom and bathroom. The size of each was incredible and decorated tastefully. We were provided with two I-Pods (loaded with 5000 songs), CD player, TV and DVD player (CDs and DVDs can be obtained from reception). There were even Bose speakers imbedded into the ceiling.
Location:
Perfect for us. We were far enough away from the hustle of Kuta (20 mins) but close to the upmarket restaurants and bars within Seminyak (less than 10 mins)",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1843,"Exceptional service, beautiful hotel",50,July 2006,"This hotel still deserves to be rated #1. The rooms are huge and exceptional. Each one has a view of the ocean and a private balcony or deck with a day bed. The bathrooms are the biggest I have ever seen (and each 1 bed suite comes with 1 1/2 baths!). The service at the hotel was also outstanding. When we arrived at breakfast in the morning, they remembered our names and our favorite table from the day before. The staff were personable and pleasant as well as incredibly helpful.

The Indonesian food on the menu is exceptional (especially the reijstafel). The food was great and the atmosphere was beautiful. The western food was a bit more expensive, but still not as much as Ku de Ta.

The pool is wonderful, although when I was there, there were several families from Australia who brought their young kids and they were kind of loud, so if you can help it, try not to go during a school holiday.

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and this remains my favorite!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1844,The Tops,50,August 2006,"This property may not be aesthetically pleasing to all but it is functional and all rooms face the sea from large balconies.
Our recent stay of 6 nts could not have been bettered and it is difficult to add any further positives to those that have already been said.
It is a shame that people concern themselves with triviality about blinds that do not close perfectly and a two tier pricing system.
This hotel is excellent and the service is second to none.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1845,Truly wonderful hotel,50,July 2006,"We booked this hotel when it was number one on tripadvisor and I was a little worried when I started to see some recent negative reviews. If you are feeling the same please take my word for it and stop!

The hotel is fantastic, the rooms are simply stunning we stayed in a deluxe suite which was huge with everthing you need and more. The resorts design and feel is much like a chic city hotel, for anyone who has stayed at the sukhothai in bangkok this has a very similar ambience.

All services are truly 5 star, although as other reviews mention the food and drink is overpriced but this really is not a problem as we were given lots of great dining options by the concierge, it just seems a shame that the hotels own facilities stay mainly empty.

If you are planning a trip to bali I would highly recomend this and also its sister resort in ubud.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1846,A Stunning Hotel in Paradise,50,July 2006,"Having read numerous reports on Trip Advisor about this hotel, we finally decided to book and spend five night in the middle of July.

From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. The service was great at all times, the rooms, dining area, pool & beach were spotless - while the security was as good as it gets in Bali.

The hotel (and particularly the restaurant) are expensive - but worth it. Include breakfast as part of your package, it was great with complimentary tea/coffee/and fantastic Balinese treats after 16h00.

Having stayed on both sides of the Island before, I would certainly recomend the west coast - from a wind , surf, trendiness and clean beach perspective.

There are numerous excellent restaurants within walking distance, and these are ridiculously cheap (even for us South Africans). The hotel is quite, close to a road, and right on the beach - if you like the sound of the ocean.

I would definately go back !!!!",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1847,Good as they say!,40,June 2006,"As a travel professional and a newcomer to Trip Advisor, I was cautious in my assessment of reviews in planning my recent holidays. However, whilst I was planning to push the boat out for a top class hotel by staying at the Four Seasons, this web site kept drawing me to The Legian with its wonderful reviews.

Having recently returned, I am can confirm that the reports are pretty spot on and its an excellent hotel in a fabulous location. The deluxe suite whilst a little old, was spacious and amenities excellent. The hotel is close to the road as mentioned in a previous review - but hardly a highway! There is little traffic to be heard - we heard more from the local dogs!

The main restaurant menu is far too formal for most casual holiday appetites - and it is true that most venture to local restaurants which are excellent. Tough to find quality Indonesian restuarants recommended locally - had to travel to Nusa Dua for a touristy yet excellent meal.

The security at the hotel was thorough and comforting. Whilst security concerned us in advance of our holiday - we felt secure at all times - especially at the quality restaurants and hotels.

Much has been said of the management. They are low profile and I would agree they should have more of a presence in such a small hotel. The only critism is really the restaurant. With an open kitchen, I only saw the chef venture out to chat with the GM - rarely to talk to a guest. My wife is vegetarian but despite several attempts to request alternative choice, the restaurant failed to provide options. The Chedi Club were excellent in this area. Preparing options and printing a special menu. I would understand if the Legian restaurant was busy - but it was mostly empty despite reasonable occupancy levels.

Overall, despite an empty restaurant - the hotel is exceptional and I would certainly return again and again. The quality of the rooms and the general ambiance is of a very high standard and the service wonderful. The location in Seminyak with an active and lively beach - close to fashionable bars and restaurants was great. A million miles from the style of nearby Kuta.

Go - you won't regret it. And make sure you visit the Chedi Club too. Very stylish.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1848,Not what I expected,30,May 2006,"After reading the reviews for the Legian I was really eager to get to the hotel. The drive from the airport took roughly 30'. When I got to the hotel I was a bit disappointed with the architecture. The building is quite massive, doesn't blend very well with the surroundings and is quite close to the main road (30 meters).
The staff was very nice during my stay but you could feel the hardship affecting everybody as people were expecting tips at every corner.
The beach is not far from the hotel, roughly 50 meters and you can hear the big waves breaking on the shore.
The rooms were ok, quite spacious but suffering from a decoration that betrays the past of this hotel. Suggestive paintings and carvings on the walls shocked me.
The breakfast was good but the dining/in room service was quite appalling. It's not important because there are a lot of alternatives in the area.
Check-in and check-out was quite efficient but I had to leave the room at noon despite my plane departing late in the evening.
Overall, I was not impressed with this hotel, very expensive by the way when compared to other choices (Oberoi or villas available for rent at half the price).
Lots of regulars I spoke to complained about recent changes in management of the hotel resulting in disappointment. I met the manager once during my 7 day stay and found him quite distant. An expensive but quiet hotel.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1849,Perfect Paradise,50,April 2006,"After nearly two weeks spent at this hotel there is no fault that we could find and believe me, we are hard to please as we are world travellers!! All the statements contained in previous reviews of this hotel we found to be correct so they don't need to be repeated.
The hotel is excellently managed and staff are exceptionally good and all know your name within 24 hours of you checking in and you are always then addressed by your name. (Don't know their trick but it's clever). If you are a book reader on holiday, don't aim on reading a word if you relax on the comfortable sunbeds near the beach as the waves ( around 4mtrs high when we were there) and the surfers are so fascinating to watch that you just forget to read. . If you have children this is not a beach for paddling!!

Only criticism of the hotel would be the restaurant where prices for dinner are far too high and the food quality is average. Outside the hotel we recommend highly for authentic Thai Food The Lemongrass restaurant (air conditioned )in Seminyak or for Indian food The Gateway to India also in Seminyak ( don't be put off by the outside appearance of these restaurants- the kitchens are spotlessly clean and food is fantastic). Both are a 10 minute taxi ride away from hotel which costs around 2Euros or US Dollars

Security at the hotel ( and all places where tourists gather) is excellent and the Balinese people hope that the tourists will start to return to the island in greater numbers as their economy depends on them.

For any of you who enjoy buying designer copy watches for a few Euros or dollars,the beach in front of the hotel is a good place to buy. For good quality we recommend Alex( look for his name printed in the display box he carries). Everything we purchased from him is still ticking!!
We will certainly be returning to the Legian again later this year and recommend it to all Trip Advisor readers.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1850,Club at the Legian is superb,50,,We stayed at the Club at the Legian for a week over Easter. It was superb from start to finish and quite exceptional value for money. We had car pick up at airport and arrived to wonderful villa with plunge pool and amazing butler. Whilst the Club is not on the beach like the hotel it is close by and you have all the facilities of the hotel. We used the spa which was very good. the food was outstanding and it is close to great restaurants like Kew Da Ta (sic?). Our butler could not be rated higher and wen't to no end of trouble to help us and make it a very very pleasant stay.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1851,Strongly recommended,50,April 2006,"In agreement with other positive reviews of the hotel. We've just returned from a wonderful trip to Bali, which included 8 days at the Legian. Hotel is top-rate, period. We had a huge room, spacious and beautifully furnished. Main attraction for us were the wonderful staff, always attentive, friendly, and anxious to please. Still haven't worked out how everyone remembers your name! Breakfast was excellent, wonderful choice of freshly prepared dishes. Hotel is clearly very well managed. Security standards were high.
Lunch/dinner were fine, but not great, so we took the opportunity to eat at the many restaurants nearby. By far the best in terms of food quality was Cafe Warisan. Kudeta is a must-go for sunset cocktails.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1852,Best Hotel!,50,February 2006,"Hotel info & facilities
I am very fussy when it comes to hotels. The Legian is definitely one of the best hotels I have come across! The hotel is located far from the major tourist spots and therefore it is very quiet. We stayed in the Studio Suite room for US$280++/night. It is very spacious with a living room, dining room and mini kitchen. The room is clean and cosy and the furniture is new with a touch of the Balinese style. The rooms are equipped with two i-pods as well as a Bose cd-player. You can request for a dvd player at no charge! Free internet access is available only if you are comfortable with using the PC that belongs to the concierge. Alternatively, laptop can be loaned for US$5/hour with an additional US$5 for wireless access.

Hotel Security
We feel very safe as the secruity is very tight; there are at least 2 security guards being stationed at the entrance of the hotel. All vehicles upon entering the hotel have to be thoroughly checked by a portable bomb detector gadget as well as a sniffer dog.

Food & Service
The food at the hotel is not very good but the service is awesome. The staff tend to remember your name and are always attentive to your needs. There are some restaurants (Kudeta, Sweet Basil-Thia, Sate Bali) within walking distance and the food is superb. Watching sunset at Kudeta is awesome.

Beach
The beach is right in front of the hotel and the waves are quite big. You can definitely surf.

I would highly recommend this hotel if you want top-class service and ambience but only if you are willing to fork out more as the minimum room rate is US$260++ and above.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1853,Luxury with Style,50,January 2006,"I have just returned from my sixth stay at The Legian, and highly recommend the hotel to travellers who prefer boutique luxury hotels. The hotel is a suite only hotel, with interior finishes of very high quality. Rooms are equiped with Bose stereo systems and ipods are provided for guest use. The hotel has a day spa, fabulous beach front pool, restaurant and pool bar. A stay at this hotel is made all the more special by attentive, but personal service. For those familiar with Aman resorts, I stayed at the Amankila some years ago, and found the service of The Legian to be at least as good as the Amankila. Touches such as chilled facial towels and iced water poolside together with complimentary afternoon tea add to the overall experience. Surely one of the best hotels in Asia.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1854,Quite nice hotel,40,October 2005,"We stayed at The Legian just after the terrible happenings at bali, the staff was very nice about it, and made us felt secure. I agree with previous people here saying that it's defently for couples and not for people with children. We found the hotel to have all the accessities we needed, and staff was very accommodating. We did find it above average, but not the best we have ever stayed at. But would recommend anyone to visit, but it's not cheap for normal standars, and especially not for bali standards.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1855,Perfection,50,January 2006,"Stayed at The Legian for 4 nights on a stopover coming back from Australia. After 3 weeks back-packing, I wanted luxury and I got it!!

I have to say, this is the best hotel I have stayed at in terms of attention to detail, staff and room facilities. All of the rooms have Bose sound systems and 2 ipods pre-loaded with a (mostly!) good selection of tunes. However bring your own CD's as there is also a CD player!

The hotel was not busy at all when I was there due to low season and the ""Bali factor"" which is sad to see as this hotel and Bali are both wonderful.

The staff could not be more helpful and courteous at all times. Everything was super efficient and you did not have to ask for anything - chances are it had already been done!

I have to say the one downside is that the hotel restaurant is expensive (by Bali standards) and tends to focus on European/Mediterranean food, which frankly is not what I came to Bali to eat. I ended up not eating there at all but instead going out for dinner to several excellent local Indonesian places where you could eat and drink well for about £5 GBP!! My personal favourite was a little Balinese restaurant about 50m from the hotel called Sate Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1856,The best service ever!,50,December 2005,"We have just returned from our honeymoon in Bali and spent 6 nights at The Legian. Having read various reviews on this site before departing I was interested to see how well it matched up. Having benefited from others reviews I thought I should contribute also:

The Legian is a excellent hotel with outstanding service and food. It is not large (64 rooms) and is directly on the beach. It appears to be quite new and is constructed from concrete pillars which have been crafted to give a distinct asian feel. The garden is pleasant but not so large and not yet really mature. The staff are extremely helpful and you are unlikely to find much better service anywhere. The food is excellent and reasonably priced for its quality. On request the kitchen researched and produced within a day a japanese breakfast for my wife even though they had never cooked one before.

We took a look at the nearby Oberoi and whilst it has beautiful gardens the rooms were quite a lot smaller, except for the expensive ocean facing suites with private courtyards. I would definitely stay at the Legian rather than the Oberoi (in any case they are only 5 mins walkng distance apart). If you do stay at The Legion I would strongly suggest getting a 1 bed suite. Ours came with a 4 poster bed and romantic white mosquito net drape and was much more comfortable than the standard suite. There are a number of good restaurants close by the Legian but you will need a taxi to get to most unless you like a 15-20min walk in the dark on a pedestrian-unfriendly street.

As often happens a few things were not perfect but the hotel did do its best to patch them up quickly. Beware however the cost of international calls, internet access ($10/hr if you use their computer) and wine (seems expensive everywhere in Bali).

Security precautions were evident at the hotel which was reassuring. There was a sniffer dog and inspection of all vehicles entering the hotel area. Security cameras were being installed in the garden also. If this is going to make you uncomfortable then you might be better off not staying in Bali. However if you don't like crowds of tourists then now is a very good time to go since its very quiet and prices are heavily discounted.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1857,Living It Up @ The Legian,50,December 2005,"We stayed at The Legian for several nights during our honeymoon and all we could say is WOW! We had a 1BR deluxe suite which was enormous and had a beautiful oceanview. The Legian is perfectly situated on Seminyak beach which is only a 15-20 minute walk along the beach to some pretty good surfing spots. The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and always at your service. The hotel is a somewhat ""hip"" feel to it which is nice. Also, you are in within walking distance of KuDeTa (excellent food) and the Oberoi. One can easily pass the day sitting along the pool and watching the waves crash along the beach. Good gym facilities. The only thing that was a bit lacking was the food at the hotel. Would definitely recommend the hotel anyway and would stay there again when in Bali.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1858,Fabulous luxury,50,November 2005,"The Gardens and setting of this hotel are truly stunning. The lighting effects at night are breathtaking.
The Studio Suites and Superior suites are both wonderful. All rooms have 2 iPods preloaded with music for you to borrow, and the rooms have Bose sound systems. There are a couple of chill-out style CDs there as well which help set the mood.
Service levels could not be higher-we were addressed by name by all the staff, even those we hadn't met yet! I would note particularly that my partner, who is Asian, has become resigned to Asian hotel staff ignoring him in favour of me - not here.
The pool area is beautiful, and as soon as you appear, so do smiling staff with cold towels and iced water. The beach directly in front of the hotel is edged by shaded day beds. There were 2 lifeguards from the hotel on duty all day, who gave candid and helpful information about swimming safety.
Perhaps I could suggest that the mark-up on wine is excessive-but there are many wonderful restaurants close by.
A stunning hotel - the concierge even met us at the airport a couple of days after our stay to help us through the airport.
We recommend springing for the superior suite - it has a bigger terrace for relaxing privately.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1859,Great Indulgence!!!,50,September 2005,"Thanks to the Hyatt being allegedly fully booked due to a convention, we spent a day at the Legian in Seminiak and it was worth every penny, although on the high end scale of one's budget. We booked one of the 2 bedroom villa which is in fact a huge 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor overlooking the ocean with a great terrace from which sunset can be enjoyed.

Service was impeccable with no attitude but siple balinese attention. Food which tends to be asian fusion type was great too. Kids and adults loved bodysurf although waves are huge and easily can scare kids and adults. The pool is a safe heaven, and overlooks the ocean... I would defintely recommend to stay one or 2 days in this hotel to be pampered with or without the spa experience.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1860,Somewhat better than the Oberoi.....,50,October 2005,Stayed at the Oberoi and the Legian and the latter is better (but also more expensive). The Legian is a bit classy and the suites (we stayed in a deluxe one) are just great and huge! Wonderful pool area.,The Legian Seminyak Bali
1861,Fantastic in every sense!,50,September 2005,"This is, by far, the Best Hotel I've ever stayed in. My Studio Suite was Huge, Luxurious, Beautiful, Comfortable... A dream come true. Having seen some pictures of The Legian I was delighted to discover the Hotel was even better than expected. Service is truly awesome and warm, you feel you're living in a perfect world. All hotel's amenities: Swimming Pool, Spa, Restaurant... are top notch. Hope I can return sometime in the future. For me it is the perfect getaway.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1862,Paradise - but not for children,50,August 2005,"We stayed at The Club Legian for 10 nights and then The Legian for 4 nights. The service at The Club and at The Legian was second to none and for once we were not disappointed on arrival.

The only negative comment I can make is that if you are travelling with children (as we were - two girls aged 8 and 9) is that the club and the hotel are not geared up for them. There were a couple of very limited activities - colouring and feeding the fish - which lasted one hour during the afternoon. The pool was fantastic but the children were constantly being reminded by the life guards on duty not to jump or dive into the pool, laughing too loud was also frowned upon. No inflatables at all in the pool. It was quite bizaar as when I looked around the pool, most present had children and were also complaining that their children were being restricted. Most couples without children took themselves off towards the beach. I did comment to the manager that if The Legian is prepared to allow children then they must also expect some noise around the pool. He was in agreement but said that several of the other guests who did not have children were complaining about the noise level. I must add at this point that all of the children were exceptionally well behaved and were even polite enought to 'ask' the life guard if they could be allowed to dive in ""just once"".

I think the hotel needs to make up its mind, its either child friendly or its not. You can't cater to both markets, the two just don't match.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1863,The Legian Was Superb,50,July 2005,"The Legian was the perfect retreat. Aside from the 4 Seasons, I don't think you'll find a better beach hotel in Bali (maybe the Aman hotels are better also). The service is exceptional every step of the way. I would request a top floor room for the best view. The restaurant is great, but you can do just as well for 1/3 of the price in the area restaurants outside of the hotel. I think eating at the hotel 50% of the time is probably best. The pool service and the chairs at the pool couldn't be better and we left very happy.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1864,Unforgetable 30th B'day trip,50,March 2004,"Where should I begin, my husband and I stayed at their one-bedroom villa, it was beautiful, private and the in-villa breakfast that is served by your private butler was relaxing not to mention delicious. The buffet breakfast at the main hotel building was even better, I would say the best spread of food my husband and I have had. The pool was fantastic but the beach was too rough, gorgeous to look at though. Fancy a late lunch? Their cheeseburger is a MUST, simply succulent and juicy.

Only a few things that I don't like, the last day before we head over to the main building for the ""downgrade"" to a one bedroom suite , there was a teeny wasp hive that I discovered attched to the pillar of the cushion in front of the pool. A little dark inside the villa and the huge fancy egg shaped outdoor tub took way too long to be filled up.

We stayed at the onebedroom suite for 3 days after 4 days at the villa and find that the spacious room was great but for someone who comes with a lot of toiletries, the small sink area was a bit tight. The thing that probably ""bothered"" us the most is the lack of good curtains to keep light out was not availiable, only weak, piecey blinds.

Curry at the KutaDa is excellent but the supposedly best pizza from the living room was very disappointing.

Service at the pool area was amazing, they lay the towel with u and serve u a tray with mist, iced water and cold towels. We really prefer the Seminyak area because the tide don't go back as much as Nusa Dua.

We're going to try Ahimsa or Kayumanis Nusa Dua or The villas during Christmas late this year, 2005. Would return to The Legian in a heartbeat but since we will be staying for a good 9 nights. We'll go for something more affordable during the festive season but still be able to enjoy privacy in a villa.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
1865,Fantastic hotel,50,,"We stayed at The Legian (on Seminyak Beach) from 1 to 7 November 2004 and loved every minute. The suites, all with sea view, are huge, modern and very luxurious. The service is perfect. The location is excellent, just a few minutes walk from some of Bali's top restaurants. Yet, the hotel's restaurant itself proved to be the best - delicious and highly sophisticated cuisine.
Highly recommended.",The Legian Seminyak Bali
