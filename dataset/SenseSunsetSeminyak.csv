0,DO NOT STAY HERE,10,March 2022,"I stayed here for my vacation for a week, I booked directly with the receptionist and had a weekly rate and paid upfront. sheets are dirty, telephone in the room not working. Spoke to reception for issues with NO result. engineers came and said the telephone in the room not working even though I told them I need the telephone to order food so I stayed with dirty sheets and stains from lipstick also holes in there from previous guests and they did not change them for me as a new guest for a week. DO NOT STAY HERE,",Sense Sunset Seminyak
1,Trust the negative reviews.,10,October 2022,"I paid for a pool access room - the only issue is there was no pool during my 2 day trip. The hotel and also Expedia would not offer any partial credit. Additionally, my shower handle broke, my water pressure was off the charts with half the water spraying the wall and half hitting me. The water was luke warm at best which was fine since it’s hot. The refrigerator was also busted and the lights would flicker when left on. Also the soap dispenser kept falling in my feet in my mission impossible shower attempt. This was one of the absolute worst experiences for a two day stay I’ve ever had. The bedding was average at best, and if you need comfort I highly suggest against this place. I’ve stayed in hostels that were more comfortable. Do not stay here until they remodel the establishment trust me on this!!! Similar price hotels all in the area. Rooms are also extremely tiny. I’d give this zero starts but hotel staff was friendly, so I will upgrade to 1 star. Management refused any refunds which is very bad business. Expedia wouldn’t refund as well. All I ask is to not be charged for a premium room if the features aren’t available. Also a working shower handle and water pressure would be nice. Oh yea the safe doesn’t work In room 5007. If the pool wasn’t empty at best this is still a 3 star hotel and that’s pushing it.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
2,NEVER STAY AT THIS THIEF HOTEL,10,February 2022,"Very disappointed, I stayed for 3 months, and cus of something i need to leave on my second month. We both agree when I come back i will continue to stay there for the rest of stay. I tried to contact their wa and call but no answer to confirm that I am back to bali, till i came the hotel tvey said I can continue starting tomorrow. And the day check in after having registration they asked me to wait till 2 so i went somewhere and came back at 2.30. Suddenly they said that currently they have no longer monthly package so the rest stayvthat i have for 28ndays is not valid anymore so they convert my stay only to 7 days, eventho before that already had my id and and cc deposit. Unilaterally on the same date they canceled, I was very confused, annoyed and disappointed with their service, I had to find a destination. And finally they offered to refund and until now my funds have not been returned. What a hotel thief",Sense Sunset Seminyak
3,Sunset sense seminyak bali,40,June 2019,"Chose the hotel as it features mezanine, as we travelled wif 3 teenage kids, and swimming pool! Both r delighting, the mezanine was spacious and air cons workd extremely well. Pool is not wide, but fine. Hope the hotel improves its breakfast ranges and taste ! 8.5 of 10",Sense Sunset Seminyak
4,Ok but wouldn’t stay again.,20,March 2020,"Location wise the hotel is in a run down area, the streets aren’t very safe to walk down and about a 40 minute walk to Kuta Beach. The hotel room wasn’t very big, with only 2 hangers for a 5 night stay? We couldn’t unpack due to lack of space which is dissapointing we had to live out of our suitcases on the floor in an already cramped room. Also the shower is rather pointless, hairdryer is very weak! 100% bring your own. Rooms are rather dark, and very noisy. Positives of the hotel room would be the air con is nice and cold and keeps the room comfortable, the TV had some good english speaking channels and the rooms were clean also get a bottle of water each day which is a nice touch. The breakfast at the hotel was not the best. Not many english options mostly just rice and chicken very much the same every day. It does have cornflakes and chocolate cornflakes, also some pineapple and papaya. Also toast making facilities, overall if your a picky eater I would reccomend going else where for breakfast. The pool in the hotel is very small and doesn’t really get any sun so we weren’t able to sunbathe which was sad. The gym in the hotel is three cardio machines which suited me fine but would be improved if they could have some weights. Overall we probably wouldn’t stay in this hotel again an ok hotel but just wasnt for us.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
5,There are two Sense Hotels in Seminyak! Check your reservation! This one is not the one near the beach!,10,February 2020,"We were browsing through hotels in Seminyak on Agoda, and happened to see Sense Hotel Seminyak. After checking out some other hotels we concluded that we were going to make a reservation on Sense Hotel Seminyak. We typed in “Sense Hotel” and quickly made a booking straight away for same day check-in. When we were to make an online taxi reservation to go tothe hotel, we were shown that there are 2 Sense Hotels in Seminyak - named Sense Hotel (close to the beach) and Sense Sunset Hotel (this one!). Only then we found out that we accidentally/unintentionally booked Sense Sunset Hotel Seminyak, and it was not the one we liked and meant to book (Sense Hotel Seminyak). Unfortunately the booking had “non refundable” condition, so we were in difficult situation. We called Agoda to cancel the reservation, they were very helpful that they would try to talk to the hotel and call us back once they received hotel confirmation. In about 5 minutes they called us back and informed us the hotel didn’t allow us to cancel the reservation. We then tried to call the hotel directly, explained them our situation but the guy on the phone was rude enough to tell us that it was fully our fault and the hotel would not refund our cancellation. We asked him to put us on the phone with his manager and a lady came on the phone, again we explained to her our situation and we asked her to transfer us to Sense Hotel Seminyak (near the beach), thinking with her position and authority she could be any of help. She confirmed that Sense Hotel and Sense Sunset Hotel belong to the same group but owned by different people thus they couldn’t just transfer me, I understood and then asked again for a refund and her answer was “because you have made your payment, our accounting team cannot refund your reservation as they will need to go through a lengthy process - I told her I wouldn’t mind waiting for my money to be back, as long as it is refunded and I can make a new reservation with Sense Hotel Seminyak, but she kept saying no without giving a proper answer, to a point I had to ask her “do you not want to give me a refund because it gives you some lengthy work?” And she started to stutter trying to correct her already-said statement.
We were so disappointed with their service that we decided not to show up for our reservation. Not only location wise it is very bad (it’s located in the big sunset road that it’s not convenient to walk around, also far from the beach! And not many things happening around), but also the rooms don’t look as nice as the other Sense. Even before our arrival we already didn’t like their service, couldn’t imagine if we experienced something during our stay they might not be helpful at all! no wonder they are rated lower than the other Sense!

So if you want to stay in a decent priced hotel, near the beach and nice cafes, where you can just walk around at during the day / night for local business shopping, definitely don’t stay here! And double check your hotel name and location, because if you booked in this hotel, you wont get your money back!!!!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
6,Cool Place on Highway,40,November 2019,We visited this place on 28th November 2019. Our tour manager Shreelaxmi arranged every thing and we god our room keys immediately. rooms were comfortable. and people were caring and helpful. restaurant has good view of pool . we stayed there up to 1st December. What we feel is its in the heart of the city but not in crowded area. we have all amenities near by. Indian restaurant for lunch as well as diner is available near just walk able distance. We recommend this place for stay in Bali,Sense Sunset Seminyak
7,A Good Hotel to stay,40,December 2019,"We stayed in this hotel for four days. It is having a small pool and many rooms are having pool view.
Staff was helpful and courteous. They served with smile. Free wi fi is available but signals are not so strong in the rooms.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
8,Limited - better elsewhere.,30,December 2019,"We booked this as part of a package with a cruise included - this hotel is VERY cheap if booked independently. I can't complain about value for money but this hotel is VERY limited & really reduced our enjoyment of Bali.
Others comments absolutely valid - no wardrobes, hangers or drawers - you are living out of your suitcase on the floor. Initially we had a room on the basement floor which was akin to walking into a Sauna - Bali was VERY humid - the room was unbearably hot with no throughflow of air - plus opaque none opening windows which faced a solid brick wall. We complained & got upgraded to the 5th floor which was a lot better but still A/C not really effective but bearable.
This Hotel is unique in not allowing us to charge things to the room !! Really never had this anywhere in the world before, we had to lodge a small cash room deposit of £10 - once that was gone which was really quickly you had to pay - so ecvery breakfast we had to pay cash, every drink the same - just really an absolute drag. Other big problem the Hotel has is some of its guests - we had the misfortune of a large number of incredibly loud Chinese guests - who shout at each other ALL the time;have their phones on really loud - shout on the landings at all hours with absolutely no respect for other guests - the similarly problematic.

The hotel has NO outside space in the sun which is a shame.

On a positive note the staff are absolutely lovely, so gentle and patient - all doing their best to make your stay as pleasant as possible.

Also there IS a little known back door which gives much quicker access to the nearby streets which host many very good and very reasonably priced restaurants.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
9,Good Location,40,June 2019,Budget hotel...Good location in busy Seminyak....Nice friendly staff and clean rooms although we did get our room upgraded so when booking choose supreme room rather than deluxe as the deluxe has no view or balcony..be prepared to be beach bums as although the hotel pool is lovely it is enclosed by the hotel rooms and doesn’t get much sun at any time of the day...They have a “back door” access which means a 5 minute walk and your at the bars and shops..another 10 mins to the beach which is well worth the walk..It can be quite noisy because of the layout of the hotel but we didn’t spend much time in it...to much to see and do in fabulous Bali !!,Sense Sunset Seminyak
10,Not a bit of outside space,30,October 2019,"This hotel should be avoided unless you want to live out a suitcase. No wardrobe space or drawers whatsoever. We were “ upgraded” on arrival to a deluxe room. A bed, tiny worktop and one cube stool. Three hangers attached to a short pole was what we were expected to put our clothes on. We had to pay extra to be moved to a suite. Don’t be fooled that it was grand. It wasn’t. It had a wardrobe but still no drawers. The safe was on the floor and as we are both in our 60’s, posed a challenge to use. Our biggest complaint is that their web site shows lovely outside sitting areas which don’t exist! The hotel sits between two roads and there isn’t anywhere at all to sit outside. The pool is tiny and has 5 sunbeds. The sun doesn’t get to it as all the rooms face on to it. The doors from the rooms don’t fit well and the noise from about 7 o’clock from children in the pool is horrendous. The shuttle takes you to the beach but doesn’t bring you back so you need to either walk (about 15 minutes) or get a taxi. Take enough money to pay for this and sunbeds at the beach. Find somewhere else.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
11,Good hotel but with a mafia taxi at the door,20,November 2019,"The hotel, the rooms, the swimming pool and the stuff are correct, but you have to be careful with the mafia in the parking lot.
We asked for a taxi and a person without documentation and in front of the security guard and the kids, told us in a very rude way that he could not enter because only they could enter and pick up customers.
I don't understand how a hotel can allow this kind of mafia that, at least for our part, have ruined the experience and I don't think we'll ever come back.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
12,Not that great,20,November 2019,"Would not recommend if you are looking for something nice. Very basic and not a 4 star.

Hotel had stains on bed, mould in shower and was left dirty.

Staff were lovely but all over very basic. Hotel drivers are a rip off and they are tight with amenities. Hotel breakfast was also basic and boring. Hotel is located 10 minute drive from Seminyak square so you will need to either walk 30 mins or pay for a taxi - better to stay closer to avoid fees.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
13,Value for money,40,December 2018,"stayed here with my family for a week. Friendly staff , good amenities. not bad for a 3.5 star rating, kids enjoyed it
bit of a walk to the markets though , but taxis are very cheap
my advice catch a ride on motorbike because of the traffic.
1hr to go 4 kms is toooo long",Sense Sunset Seminyak
14,Pleasant Stay,40,September 2019,"Stayed here for 10 days, nice little hotel nice welcoming reception, and surprisingly a quick check in,
Bed and breakfast as we were out usually most of the day and evenings and restaurants and cafes are pretty cheap there and good priced. The breakfast was a little to be desired, found the food wasn’t that particularly hot, this was owing to the other guests opening the lids and not closing them, the Chinese in particular.
The room was not to bad nice large double bed, I did notice on a couple of occasions the sheets although cleaned every other day were not that clean some stained but didn’t say anything this time, the kettle was not working when we arrived, the button was stuck but room service soon changed that pretty quickly, not enough sugar or creamers and coffee, but this was not really a major problem as we tend to bring out own coffee and fresh milk on arrival and bottles of water. The safe in our room was just the right size and quick to learn how to use it with a pin number of your choice, kept our passports in a camera and mobile phones and money.
Had two bottles of complimentary water a day delivered to our room, this was nice and the cleaning didn’t do a bad job, though it would have been nice to have a clean smell in our rooms once completed.
The Balcony was slightly small and no chairs or tables to sit out onto in the mornings where we could have our first coffees, I had to ask for a chair, but again they were obliging and no waiting for it.
Downfall was that there were no drying area and we were not allowed to put anything on the balcony and there were new signs stating this hallway through our stay, the drying area in the bathroom was
An retractable washing line and a small nut on the end to lodge into a metal clasp the other end and rusty. There was no hot water in the shower, it was just warm with a rusty shower-head and the Bathroom Douche Sprayer Toilet Bidet was not clean at all and had to buy some disinfectant to clean it.

We found the rest of the hotel, pretty much clean and tidy and information downstairs was good and a smoking area just above the pool that was open until about 10PM and then a sign saying closed, I couldn’t understand why this was, and my only other gripe was when parties of Chinese stayed, they had no respect for other guests, they were noisy and loud and very rude. (Not to me, as I put them in their place)
Would I stay here again? Yes and would also recommend it
Thank you",Sense Sunset Seminyak
15,A ‘Memorable’ but Disgusting Moment,10,October 2019,"We stayed at this facility at Sense Sunset seminyak (Jl. Sunset Road) for 3d/2n. we checked out today (sept 31,19 to october 2nd,19).

Just wanted to share some unpleasant experience as well as disgusted moment prior to check out day.

Started with a over-promised about room availibility that keeps us waiting until we decided to leave for our late lunch outside the hotel.

One thing that made us really disgusted is that we found out that there is a big cockroach ceeeping into the inside curtain in our room.
This is our holiday and we did buy few snacks that we left it open throughout the night. I ended up throw away everything and was checked out wondering if it was that ‘big cockroach’ that made my skin itchy until now.

I was looking for the Manager on Duty and as he was on briefing, I called the receptionist and finally had the housekeeping to remove the ‘creature’

What a memorable stay at Sense Seminyak
And I do hope that they disinfectant and do a deep cleaning each room very regularly.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
16,"Great ambience, beach view, and service",50,September 2019,This is my first time visiting this restaurant with my friends. This place has a beautiful sunset view. Great drinks to enjoy the time and feel relax. We were greeted by a kind hostess (trisya) and waiter (dadi). They gave us a superior service. We'll come back..,Sense Sunset Seminyak
17,Cheap and nasty,20,September 2019,"We booked this place last minute through Agooda and arrived to have the receptionist question if we have paid as they had not received payment from agooda yet (which we had and this is not our problem). They then had to check our room before we went in so we decided to go to their restaurant as we were hungry..

What a disappointment. It was expensive and took a long time and the portion sizes were TINY. My bowl of French fries was only half filled and took a very long time to come out.

We finally got to our rooms. They were ok however we were right next to the main road and the road noise all night was so loud. No sound proofing on the windows.

The air con didn’t work properly in our room either. The bathroom is very run down and needs a decent clean.

It’s ok for cheap accommodation however we only stayed one night and will not be back.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
18,mischievous,10,August 2019,"We booked this hotel from 24-25/8/19.At the time of registering they deposited caution money,OK.They told they have a free service to visit sea beach in next day,OK.When we entered into room,there were two 1.5 L.In next morning we asked for beach travel.
They answered you were not registered.They have not informed us about registration at last night.
When we checked out the hotel on 26/8/19 they charged the price of the water bottles.They said there was a small red sticker.They charged IDR 250000 for compensation there was a red lipstick mark on bedsheet.When we challenged, they bowed down.They arranged a car service to airport IDR 200000 whereas taxi service was IDR 100000.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
19,Budget,30,August 2019,"Not some where I would usually stay but I got a cheap Jetstar package . The location is poor, right on sunset main road , although you can access Seminyak through back door.
The room was ok , just average. Pool clean . Breakfast was average, plenty of choice but not great quality.
The one thing I did not like was the constant noise at all hours ! There was a lot of sporting teams staying here and it was very noisy all the time , early hours of morning and throughout the night.
The staff were friendly and helpful when we needed something.
It is not somewhere I would stay again",Sense Sunset Seminyak
20,Excellent budget hotel,40,August 2019,"We stayed at Sense Sunset Seminyak for two nights. It's located on a main road, very close to a food street and many convenience stores.

Rooms are decently sized, everything works in the room: air conditioning, tv, all taps, and bedding.

Staff is courteous and overall we had good experience.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
21,please run away,20,August 2019,"I booked by Airbnb I arrived late at the hotel ... they could not find my reservation and made me wait more than one hour ...
Then my room was on the swimming pool with kids starting yelling at 7am !!!
I wanted to speak to the manager ... sorry he is too busy !! I wanted 40minutes ...
Then I went to work ... when I came back the receptionist, which is very friendly, proposed me an upgrade :., bigger room but same noisy problems ...

23,Good value for money,30,July 2019,A well priced hotel. The format of rooms surrounding the central pool make the rooms quite noisy if children are playing in the pool. Rooms clean but a little shabby. Beautiful linen. Staff are outstanding.,Sense Sunset Seminyak
24,Extremely Friendly Staff,50,July 2019,Confused at reviews where people say the staff were rude. Stayed at this hotel for over a week and did not come across one rude member of staff they were all super friendly and polite. We checked in at 3 in the morning- the staff were extremely helpful and helped with our luggage (we also didn't have the room deposit and they told us not to worry we could pay them the next day after we visited an atm). Rooms are nice and clean- drinking water in the rooms provided everyday. Breakfast is good there is a mixture of english& Indonesian food! Would 100% stay again!,Sense Sunset Seminyak
25,Our Bali Adventure,50,July 2019,"We travelled to Seminyak in Bali and had the most amazing stay at Hotel Sense Sunset in Seminyak! The staff were friendly, but one amazing lady called Okta touched my heart! She went out of her way to make our stay in Bali unforgettable!! Thsnk you Okta and thsnk you Sense Sunset Hotel!!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
26,Very poor,20,June 2019,"This was our final destination following 3 nights in both Dubai and Singapore and we were looking forward to being able to unpack and chill. Hotel staff friendly but didn't all understand English. Room overlooking pool, no wardrobe just 2 coat hangers out of the wall. Towels were certainly not white or in good condition. Patio doors onto small balcony were not soundproof. At night the noise was very loud and I complained to reception who were apologetic. English not catered for at breakfast again with very little choice. Would definitely never stay there again.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
27,Six night stay,30,June 2019,"Generally quite clean and I especially love the friendliness of the staff.

I just wish the staff would take the time to ask the Chinese visitors not to make so much noise. I get rudely awakened early every morning by the stampede to the breakfast area, so sleeping in late here is not an option.

So for me, the only problem I have with this hotel is the noise level.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
28,Not the best,30,June 2019,"On the website the hotel looks amazing. We booked a suite, which was just alright in reality. The bathroom look old and worn down. After staying for 5 nights they haven’t changed the bedsheets. The fist thing we noticed was the stains all over the sheets. The same stains were on the sheets every day. Having a good night sleep is hard, we woke up many times during the night because of the thin walls. You can hear everything from the other guest. If someone drops something on there room you will hear it. In the morning you can hear when people are using the cutlery. Otherwise you can hear people walking, slamming door, talking loud and there are a lot of knocking on doors. The breakfast consists of rice, dry chicken, and soups. Not a lot of options for bread or healthy alternatives. However, the staff was so kind and friendly! We felt so safe and welcome!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
29,Average,30,June 2019,"The best thing about this hotel was the friendly and helpful reception staff.
Do not expect a good night’s sleep as there is constant noise through the night from both residents and staff (housekeeping knock on your door very early in the morning)
Very poor WiFi quality, kept disconnecting and saying there was no internet. When it was connected, nothing loaded and it was extremely slow.
Would not stay here again.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

31,There are better 3-star hotels ...,30,May 2019,"We place the booking in early April for 5 rooms (2 nights) for last weekend. We are aware that this is not a 5-star hotel, but since we book 4 weeks in advance, we expect to get a clean and a well-prepared rooms for the group.

Well, on the 1st night we learn that : Most of the rooms smell funny; The towel is no longer white, but dark off white (bedsheet also looks old) and some bugs in the room . But the most shocking thing is (especially for the ladies) they run out of shower caps. Except for the shower cap issue, other problems are being handled quite promptly by the staffs.

The location is near the suckling pig restaurants, and it has a back door to some hang outs places in Seminyak. And 24 hour convenience stores are just across and beside the hotel.

The breakfast is very not special, so better skip this and have breakfast some place else.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
32,You pay for what you get,50,February 2019,"Forget all the negative reviews this hotel is excellent on a budget. Stayed on a b&b basis and only used it as a base as I was out all day. Staff very friendly and professional. Breakfast Indonesian hey your in Indonesia what do you expect full English? Rooms clean and tidy I stayed in room 5359 great aircon, great water pressure and cleaned every day.
Beach about 30 minutes walk away at 30 degrees heat pace, nice and clean not covered in plastic, lots of sellers on the beach but all very friendly if you don't want anything they will leave you alone. Lots of beach bars all great guys, stop and have a chat and a bintang.
If I ever return to Bali I will return to Sense Sunset.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
33,Horrible experience,10,April 2019,"We had booked 7 rooms from 22 April tp 30th April. The hotel standards are very low esp cleanliness . 3 times i have walked out of the shower with no towels. It happened to the rest of my colleagues. They don't changed their sherbets, pillowcases and their comforter. There were a lot of stains and we have to keep asking them to do their job. Please hire people that have pride in their jobs and actually care for your guest. I will not go into your inedible foods. Horrible!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
34,STA Travel - BALI Accomodation,20,April 2019,"Got this deal through STA Travel and don’t believe any of their staff or management have stayed there before. We were given the impression that this is a 4-star hotel, and it most certainly was not.

Except for the damp smell, faeces on the wall and stained sheets (which appeared to be blood drops on it)

I would say it was an okay place to rest. Would I ever be back, sadly no!

On our arrival on Sunday, a crowd of people were screaming, swimming and causing havoc. We were told no one was permitted to swim after 9pm yet a specific group of people who seem to be above other guests when it came to the hotel rules (the noise levels were a constant issue during our stay)

We complained 4 times out of the 7 days we stayed there and had to even ask cleaning staff (paid them extra) to clean our unit correctly (this was before we bought detergents to clean it ourselves again) when we requested another room, we were informed we will have to pay for the accommodation.

On Friday night, I phoned reception 13 times from 2am yet no one answered the phone, and there was a crowd of people who were screaming and slamming doors consistently. Saturday when we went to complain, we were told that they have tried to call us and tell us they had a room available – which was strange as no one from the hotel had come to us or left a note to go to the front desk.

Food, it was not the worst, it’s very oriental and not as ""European"" as described on the internet.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
35,5th flor ok.,30,March 2019,"Sense Sunset just on sunset Boulevard is an ok hotel. But not quiet 4 star hotel.
When we arrived at 9 pm hotel was ready at 2 pm.. Ok. that's the conditions. 5 th. flor gave us a god look to the pool down under. The room 5559 was ok, we asked for chairs for balcony. Cleaning was ok. We had included breakfast. breakfast ok. varm dishes fine bread but nearly nothing to put on. Coffee not drinkable. Summary god hotel to the price, friendly service. Outside taxi De Wan was excellent.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
36,Not a four star hotel,20,April 2019,"Starting with the good points. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. The bed is comfortable. Nothing else good to say. The breakfast is very limited for the European tastes basically catering for Asian tastes which I suppose is to be expected. No English breakfast ( eggs.bacon,sausage,tomatoes) which was very unusual. The only English food was toast and jam and a very limited selection of fruit ( melon,pineapple and papaya ) all quite tasteless. There is no bar and the one and only evening meal we had in the hotel was just about edible. We ate out after that experience.The hotel is very noisy and we had no privacy in our room. We were on the ground floor and the window/ sliding doors opened directly onto the pool. People were sitting within inches of the door so the curtains had to be closed all the time which although gave privacy ,did nothing to dull the screaming and shouting . Although the bathroom was clean,the shower leaked badly so care had to be taken when stepping out. We were surprised that there was no effective air conditioning in the hotel as Bali is very humid. The air conditioning in our room however was very good after we asked for it to be fixed. This was done promptly. We are seasoned travellers and this hotel was not our favourite by any means !",Sense Sunset Seminyak
37,Worst hotel we have ever stayed in.,10,April 2019,"We arrived at the hotel the 11th February 2019 just after 23:00. Reception was delayed, nobody took our luggage to our room or even guided us to our room. The room was small, dated and not very clean. No cupboards or windows that could open. Aircon was intermittent. Breakfast was found to be very limited. Lots of noise so sleeping late was not possible. Complaining to front desk didn't help as they had a couldn't care attitude. There is no spa, the website overpromises but the hotel really under delivers.

I really feel that we got ripped off as this hotel is far from 4* rating. This was more like a motel.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
38,Low standard,10,March 2019,"Nothing much to say, another cheap hotel with below average services. Staff were very rude, room was dirty and the pool was too slipery. Breakfast was good they have plenty of vegetarian options. I asked two times to the housekeeper to change my towels but looks like he didn't understand my English though. Staff at the front kinda have their own business with each other, no sense of helping at all. The small lady at the reception enjoyed talking to the phone for about 10 minutes and she did not even try to show that she is busy ;). Hard to believe but I will rethink to be back for the low prices.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
39,Excellent service!,50,March 2019,"So my family and I were struggling to find a hotel at late night and we were also very exhausted since we were traveling the whole day then finally we found this hotel which seemed the best for us since it had an affordable price along with interconnected rooms but unfortunately when we got there the rooms we wanted weren't available but luckily the receptionist named Nanda did a very kind act of humanity and gave us a deluxe room for the same price of a regular room along with breakfast for 5 people which was not supposed to be included in our package.

40,DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!!!,10,March 2019,"Sense Sunset Seminyak

Seminyak

Worst of worst experience! DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!!!!!

I am going to say SPECIALLY to a lady and a guy at the reception, go home! You guys are totally not deserving to work in a hotel!
I am not saying other staff are good but they both are the worst, they are VERY RUDE and it ANNOYED me so much. I was expecting to have a great time as this is my first time in Bali but seems everything is out of expectations. Room was too small for me and my wife, lot of Asian people walking in front of my room with their super loud voice. Do not go to this hotel if you don't want to ruin your holiday!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
41,Horrible Experience!,10,March 2019,"Receptionists are very unfriendly, very unprofessional and rude. Checked in process was terrible because it was very chaotic and confusing. Room was below average, one of the side lamp needed to be fixed. Extra bed was terrible. Overall not worth it for 4 stars hotel!.
Not recommended and will never stay in this hotel again!.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
42,Good stay,30,February 2019,The hotel was in close proximity to the busy areas within the area. We walked to Seminyak village mall and the beach. Breakfast could be improved though. It was just too much of the same thing and lacked variety. It catered for mostly Asians and not so much fir others. Had to eat fruit all day. Otherwise this was value for money,Sense Sunset Seminyak
43,Arrived home with an unbelievable disappointment.,10,March 2019,"I am so sorry to say this. I just arrived home with an unbelievable disappoinment. I stayed here for two nights and I can say almost everything in this hotel is hard to be liked. Start from the Check in administration at the reception, oh My God they did not even smile or greet you or recognize your presence. I had even think am I a ghost? for a moment.
Unfortunately, my room was in the ground floor which is near the restaurant, it was noisy all the time. The room next to my room was a crazy noise. I do not know what to say about the staff, they walk in the corridor with screaming, laughing, don't they even know there are customers staying there? Did you really train your staff of how hospitality is? Did you even warn your staff of how to act in front of your guests? I can say the price is cheap, but man! You call yourself a 4* hotel! The only thing that made me happy was the Marinara pizza, it was soo yum.
One of my family is working there but I did not expect this kind of service during my stay. I pay everything. This is a general feedback as I am working in a hospitality too, and I can see there is a big chance for you guys to grow. If you can just train your staff specially the front office only to""smile"", and train the overall staff to control their attitude if they are in hotel area, that will delete all the negative comments you got until now. I know most of your staff are young, but at least they know they are working for service, satisfaction, and feedback. I know the Hotel Manager can do it. Thanks",Sense Sunset Seminyak
44,Noisy and dirty,10,February 2019,"Pay attention to all negative reviews previously listed .
Very dirty - same sheets on the bed for 6 nights ( and yes we did ask for them to be changed )
2 small towels in the bathroom for 2 grown adults ... no bathroom a me I ties at all except for a toothbrush
Extremely noisy guests who were fighting in the hallways and heavens above the noise they all made at am for breakfast for 4 mornings in a row.
Front desk people were very rude and cold when we signed in and they were 1 room short for the group booking and kept us awake and waiting til almost 3 am ( 3 hours wait for them to find the missing room )
Daily the cleaning crew opened our small handbags and shopping bags while we were out ( we checked by leaving and string in the zippers - they were inside the bags when we returned not where we had placed them .

Not a place I would recommend to anyone able to pay a fee dollars more for a cleaner quieter better equipped and hospitable hotel .",Sense Sunset Seminyak
45,Decent Budget Hotel,40,January 2019,I stayed here for 4 nights and everything was fine! It is a cheap hotel and you pretty much get what you pay for. Nothing fabulous about it but everything worked! It is located in Seminyak so it was easy to go anywhere!,Sense Sunset Seminyak
46,Pathetic.....,10,February 2019,"I took 25 students and supervisors on their graduation trip. The hotel had very rude people in the reception when we arrived .... Had booked 1 less room than was needed... The bedsheets were not changed for 5 days so we slept on top of them... They didn't put soap or any immedentities you would normally find in a hotel.. You had to use the ones provided in the dispenser and they all smelled the same ( hand.. Hair and shower gels).

Them orning buffet is great for a foreigner if you don't mind eating omelet and doughnuts daily for breakfast otherwise it's not a good buffet breakfast.

The room service food was wonderful and was delivered to the room with a smile.

As mentioned in many other reviews... The noise throughout the night a D early morning is unbelievable so be prepared to wake up early to. Link clink of the dishes in the restaurant and to be awoken all night with the high voices of those who are in the hallway.

Wasn't worth the money and certainly was not worthy of being a 3 star hotel even.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
47,Great value,40,February 2019,"Stayed 8 night here $28 AUD a night with breakfast through Agoda. Hotel is clean and well maintained great pool for cooling of in the heat of the day. Central to Seminyak, Legian, Kuta and short drive to Canggu.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
48,Slightly below average (very slightly),30,December 2018,"For the price you pay, this isn't such a bad hotel. I'm writing an honest review and my observations to help others who are deciding on this hotel. No pros & cons, you always choose where you want to stay. In no particular order:
- Staff is friendly. Their comprehension of English is good enough, although sometimes communication was a bit tough (or maybe the Bahasa that I know wasn't good enough). E.g. I asked to use an iron for 3 days straight, housekeeping kept saying someone had requested for it and they don't know where it is (I'm thinking they only have ONE iron in the entire hotel). So I resorted to send my clothes for ironing outside. When I asked if that was ready and to be sent up to my room, they sent the actual iron and not my clothes (I also asked if my clothes was ironed already 3x, they said the iron went missing again. Go figure.)

- I'm sure the rooms they posted on Trip Advisor is for show only because my room didn't look like that. It's either very ""premium"" or they only have a handful of ""good"" rooms in the hotel. My room was fairly old, rusty, taps were moldy & a bit rusty. Walls could use with some fresh lick of paint. Not 100% the cleanest, I would rate it 5/10 cleanliness. I found a hair on one side of the bed. Room slippers were definitely not new and used before (you can tell from the soles). Towels were a bit worn too.

- No fridge, so if you have a bottle of wine (screw-top would be easier), you can borrow their wine bucket (which is a plastic bucket tub and pay for some ice for like a dollar).

- BYO Hairdryer if you are a stickler for drying your hair. Their hairdryer isn't strong and will take a long time to dry your hair esp if you have long hair.

- No comments on the food as I only ordered once, which was alright.

- Good WiFi

- Bed was very comfy, esp if you have a hangover. Good blackout curtains too. I requested to extend my checkout time (half a day) on 1 Jan. You just need to pay extra - trust me, worth the investment (didn't cost me much.. like less than $20).

- Other reviewers said it was suuuper noisy. Guess this depends where your room is located, but every hotel around the world will be noisy be it from hotel guests or staff. I coped with the noise no problem (even in a hungover condition)

- Location of hotel was not that bad. Every taxi driver or GoJek driver will know where it is. You can walk to the heart of Seminyak in about 20 mins, depending how fast you walk. It's on the main strip of road.

Overall -- simple, basic, can serve its purpose of just staying there for sleeping at night and out all day. If you want fancy, super clean, at this budget-friendly price, might not be the one for you.
If you are fancy-free, go for it :) Personally, I don't think I will stay here again and learn to book my Bali accommodation way in advance for NYE!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
49,Value for money- low budget,40,December 2018,"We stayed there from 17th to 24th December 2018. The first impression was welcoming amidst the language barrier. Upon entering the room there was this stale damp smell which did not go well with me. After making a big fuss the manager showed me other rooms which had the same smell, he however offered us two cards to the room ( when we out the aircon remains on) which made a huge difference. The room was clean and neat. Bathroom small but clean. The breakfast had a wide variety, not very western but ok. The atmosphere was also great. The pool in the middle was just awesome - a place to relax or just watch the kids in the pool. However if you wish for quite me time don't choose the ground floor or rooms with balcony, it gets noisy when guest are enjoying the pool. The staff was friendly and helpful at all times, the humbleness and respect stuck in my mind. Going back to the stale smell in the room, after going on tours in the outdoors we encountered the same smell and came to the conclusion that is a Bali smell- where there is not enough ventilation or because its so humid hence nothing to do with unhygienic. Overall a good pleasant stay.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
50,Don’t bother,30,December 2018,"I wouldn’t recommend this hotel for several reasons.

The location: it isn’t near the beach (if that’s what you’re seeking). It is a decent walk to the nearest beach (incidentally this is Seminyak beach which is horrible). Trips to Kuta or other, nicer, areas require a taxi ride to reach them. The hotel sits on a main road which is busy with traffic and unpleasant and polluted to walk along.

The noise levels in the hotel are intolerable. The pool area is nice however nearly all the hotel rooms overlook this area and it effectively behaves like a amphitheater. The noise will rise into your room and you can delight in the shrieks of families enjoying the pool at 7am (the pool opens at 9). Or alternatively you can enjoy hearing people drinking, smoking and laughing at 1.30am. New Years Day was fun - guests playing their Bollywood music on speakers and blaring it throughout the hotel.

Breakfast is not catered for Westerners - this is probably because this hotel’s clientele mainly consists of Asians and locals. The most western it got was cornflakes and toast. We went out for breakfast for the remainder of our stay.

I agree with other reviewers regarding the cleanliness. Towels look as though they need throwing away and replacing. Walls are quite grimy and bedsheets at times had holes and tears in them.

The staff are polite and want to accomodate you. However I suspect they feel powerless to stop guests doing whatever they feel like.

If your intention during your holiday is to stay out all day and come home late either tired or drunk, then the noise in this establishment probably wouldn’t be an issue for you.

However just do yourself a favour and book somewhere else.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
51,One of the worst hotel i’ve ever stayed.,10,January 2019,"The AC is broken, no refrigerator, they had awful party downstairs for newyear since 3pm until midnight. And the sound was crazy loud. The linen wasn’t clean at all. The TV is not really working and the security asked me that i was staying here or not because i am indonesian (i am not working girl or prostitute). But never asked white girls or bule girls. I’d never recommended THIS HOTEL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh the wifi is sucks! Plus we asked for the plates one time and never come!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
52,Last minute booking,30,December 2018,"Very friendly and super helpful staff, always on hand to offer advice or assistance. Hotel was decent, nothing special, I mean we paid £21 a night.

One big downside is the noise... you can hear everything through the walls and corridors, especially when people (including the staff) talk loudly outside the rooms and bang around everywhere. We found it difficult to get a solid nights sleep. If you’re a light sleeper it might be worth asking for a room away from everyone. Swimming pool is nice and refreshing but not much chance of getting a tan there or sunbathing around the pool as it’s surrounded on all sides by a 5 storey building.

The location we though at first was a little away from things but in hindsight it worked out well. It was just a 20 min walk to the beach and it got us to explore more. They have a rear entrance so you don’t have to walk down the main Sunset Road all the time too. Overall, a good place to stay!!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
53,A Hotel...Just not Professional,20,December 2018,"It’s a hotel, so it get a start for having walls, a door, etc. It has staff so it gets another star.

Professional? Not this hotel.

Checking in at 4:30pm the room was not ready.

It is standard practice for hotel staff to take your credit card and disappear for 10 minutes. Even in South East Asia that is a stupid mandate for staff and in less developed countries it does not happen.

The “manager” who clearly was not a manager of the site and have no GOA, couldn’t understand this, so que a 10 minute dialogue with a final “oh” when told to find the clown with my partners credit card.

The hotel follows the hugely irritating “local” taxis and tries to operate in part of this cartel. That just angers people, if I want to use grab I’ll use grab, I’m a big boy.

The rooms are dirty, not occasionally dirty, but endemically dirty indicating this is an accepted level of cleanliness.

Avoid, stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and grab into Seminyak, that in contrast is a bonafide hotel that operates professionally.

This is but a building with some people in it. And it’s filthy.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

55,Affordable. Wonderful staff,40,November 2018,"An affordable central hotel. The staff are genuinely friendly and happy and willing to help.
They make sure to assist wherever needed.
They have quite a nice pool where you can enjoy cooling down in the Balinese heat. Make sure to try the Ayam porridge, translates to ""Chicken"" porridge.
The room is a bit small, but it is what you pay for.
Everything is in walking distance, including clubs and scooter rental place.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
56,Not a 4 star hotel!,10,November 2018,"Room was pleasant and so were the majority of the staff.

One issue lied with being a front facing room. Even being on the top floor there was significant road noise due to the balcony doors not shutting properly.

There is also a self imposed restriction by the hotel on outside taxis. This is so the ‘mafia taxis’ run by the hotel can charge extortionate rates to nearby destinations, 80k to the nearby Seminyak centre whereas the popular Grab company only charges 20k. After getting in this car just outside the hotel the other taxi driver became very aggressive towards myself, my girlfriend and the driver.

The other issue we encountered involved room service. Ordering food which appears plastered all over hotel lifts, apparently is only available in the restaurant itself and cannot be brought up. Given the hefty 11% service charge they slapped on everything, you would expect it happily paraded up the stairs let alone simply brought up in the lift.

The gym also only consists of 3 cardio machines, 2 of which work.

Very, very disappointed.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
57,Very very noisy hotel,30,November 2018,"We stayed in November for 2 weeks when on holiday in Bali. As previous reviews have said the noise levels in the hotel are very load from 7am to 12 midnight most of the time, pool has a 9am-9pm opening time but people seemed to be swimming at all hours with nobody stopping them. We are vegetarian to breakfast was ruled out as most are aisian dishes and mainly with meat. Location is out of the way slightly, we walked to the beach one day but took 30 mins and it is far too hot to do that everyday but about 30000 in a bluebird (£2). Room was smallish, bed comfy enough but only 3 hangers so lived out a suitcase for 2 weeks. Hotel so noisy we left to go to Ubud for 3 days and would recommend people stay there instead. Drains in Bali aren't great but the shower and sink smelt strongly towards the end of our holiday...swimming Pool is fantastic however but not much sun to sit in, covers the area about 11-3 and there are only 6 sunbeds. Staff however are fantastic, faultless, just doesn't seem to be any control over the noise or swimming times, bit of a free for all. Mainly very noisy Asian and local guests staying for 1 / 2 nights for which this hotel is made for. Do not stay any longer than that.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
58,Great stay,50,November 2018,"Was great. Very helpful and friendly staff close to everything. safe place to stay. Yummy food. good value and offers driver and other services pool was lovely
I would recommend to other people and would stay again",Sense Sunset Seminyak
59,Not what we were expecting at all.,20,October 2018,"We stayed here from the 11 to the 23 October, we were expecting a quiet relaxing stay. Boy were we in for a big surprise.

We were given a ground floor garden room initially room 5083. The room was nice enough although very basic, however I agree with other comments that they are small, but strangely there were no wardrobes or drawers so nowhere to unpack, only 3 hangers on a bracket on the wall. So we were living out of our suitcases.

However, the biggest issue was the noise starting daily from 6am it was just terrible. We complained to reception and after some time they moved us to the 5th floor to room 5557 as they said it would be quieter there.

It was marginally better but not much, the issue is the hotels pool which is in the middle and people can go swimming from early morning to late at night and the location of it acts as an amplifier as half the rooms look onto it. Add to this you have the restaurant next to the pool so you get the added noise from breakfast from 6am, plus the hotel is popular with Asian people who are not very quiet and love to bang doors in the middle of the night and like to talk very loudly at all times as well. To add to this the corridors have tiled floors so this compounds the noise levels even more.

We were constantly complaining to reception about this who seemed powerless to do anything about it, there is CCTV everywhere so I find it strange that the noise makers could not be identified and it addressed. There have been many previous reviews on TripAdvisor about the noise levels and they advise this is being addressed but it clearly is not, as the noise was relentless and we were not getting much sleep at all. We were out for most of the day but upon returning in the evening parties of guests/locals with children would be in the pool and noise levels would be very high.

We were out one day and upon our return our room was not made up. We rang reception and asked why, after some confusion we were not getting anywhere so we both went down to find out why. The staff seemed quite amused and were laughing at us, now I have travelled all over the world and in fairness there was a language issue, however I was not very happy that we were the source of the entertainment, 3 or 4 members of staff kept going behind the reception door smirking and laughing. This was making us very annoyed to say the least as we only wanted to find out why they had not made our room up.

A lady called Onka or Ouna (I think) established that the reason the room was not done was that they had decided to move us to another room as we still were unhappy with the noise levels, but completely forgot to tell us so. I was not happy about moving yet again but they said it would be an upgrade to a better room. I asked why we were not told before and she said they had forgot.

The upgrade was very nice but our only concern was about the noise levels, so we viewed the room first. We established that the noise was practically the same but the room was much larger and had a wardrobe and a bath too (which leaked all over the floor as there was a hole at the top!!) so we decided to take advantage of this and packed our stuff up and moved again, this time to room 5365 and finally unpacked our cases.

Strangely the hotel has no 4th floor you go straight from the 3rd to the 5th floor so we were only down one level?

Breakfast was OK, but it is not really suited to western tourists and was very repetitive with no variation at all for the duration of our stay.

It was also difficult to get my porridge which I brought with me heated up due to the issues with the microwave the hotel was having. Also there was a different person each day on the egg station and some days they had no idea on how to cook them, so I was not the only person I saw doing this took over and cooked there own eggs.

All in all we were so disappointed as we expected a calm relaxing and restful stay, which is not what we had at all. In fairness the staff work hard and most are very nice and polite but the photos are not a real accurate reflection of this hotel.

We did not try the Ashok spa as the prices were very high and you only have to walk out of the hotel and there are literally hundreds of spas and massage places much cheaper outside.

The location of the hotel as other reviewers have said is on a very busy main road so if you stay non pool side there is another issue with noise as we spoke to several guests who said this was as bad or worse as the poolside rooms. But we managed to walk to the beach which took around 30 mins and the main tourist area took the same time too, so that was not too bad.

In summary, if you want a nice relaxing and peaceful stay in Bali and a good night sleep, I would suggest not staying at this hotel.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

I arrived early and so tired of my flight and I was hoping to check in early since ill be checking out early in morning of October 4. Was just a bit disappointed that they still let me pay for early check in. The hotel and place is so good. The buffet breakfast is the best. They upgraded my room to Deluxe room which I am very grateful. Staff are all nice and helpful. I just had a problem first when I arrived because the working table is broken, they have to send someone to repair it so I cant sleep after the flight. Sometimes aircon is not that cool,

It was really nice, being able to go straight to the pool after a long, hot day in Bali and be able to have an easy access in and out of the room but you have to adjust yourself to the the fact that you could hear EVERYTHING outside, and I mean EVERYTHING, from people chitchatting to waking up early from the sound of forks and knives hitting the plates from the breakfast in the restaurant that was right outside our room. I mean, we could hear the sound of slippers from the people walking outside. As two girls, we did not feel 100% safe at night, most people are drunk and stare a little too much, but as long as we're in our ""locked"" room, we felt safe enough.

If you are just looking for a relatively cheap room to stay, then it does the job well. However, the hotel is based on a very busy road and the traffic noise is omni-present. The room has all you needed : a double bed, a safe, a mini bar and well functioning shower room. The breakfast was quite extensive but more tailored towards Asian hot breakfasts. There are very few healthy options other than some fresh papaya and watermelon fruit. The bread selection only has refined white flour options and any herbal teas are charged extra. The hotel's guest were mainly domestic travellers and from mainland China. The breakfast area and the lobby can get very busy and noisy at times.

It had nothing to do with the amazing staff, they were lovely, professional, helpful and were the only reason we did not change hotels after the first night! However, everything else was terrible...
The pictures are deceptive as the rooms are tiny, it is extremely dated and pokey and every bit a budget stay. The other guests (not a place frequented by Aussies) were out of control, up all hours of the night and day being as loud as they pleased with no one in site to stop them, playing music and devices at the breakfast tables as they liked and other distasteful habits. The beds and pillows were seriously uncomfortable and with the noise on top we got no sleep! I also noted, due to having a fake tan on, that the linen is not changed once throughout your stay. The room service food is not suited to western cooking tastes and the breakfast on offer is less than impressive on this front as well, with not even an offer of pancakes it should be considered a continental breakfast of toast and cereal for western tastebuds. It also stated that we were in a non smoking room, however as you walk to the lift from tour room you pass smokers from the other side regularly and people were allowed to smoke in the pool area (right next to breakfast tables) whilst you ate your breakfast, just disgusting!

71,Value for Money,40,August 2018,"I did read the past reviews but I know the Bali accommodation scene, and what's in the market, and their rates. This property is certainly tired. The usual story of Owners not spending money to upkeep the place leaving the hotel to manage with minimum budget on hand. So hotel staffs do their best with what they've got.
The hotel is located in a very good location, easily accessible to Seminyak, Denpasar and Kuta as it's right on Sunset Road closer to Seminyak side. The hotel isn't dirty, it's just old and worn out hence the appearance of ""dirty"". But for under $30 USD per night including all taxes, how could one really complain when you have an air-conditioned room, free wifi, clean comfortable bed, and a hotel shower, plus a large selection of channels on TV. Oh,,,forgot to mention, they have a pool too. To those complainers, why don't you go pay US$400++ /night at the W Hotel up the road instead?",Sense Sunset Seminyak

73,4-star hotel?,30,June 2018,"Advertised as a 4-star hotel, it was pretty annoying to wait for my room to be ready. I did late-booking, and checked-in later that evening. I was expecting that my room would have been ready soon as I arrived coz I was exhausted. The front officer asked me to wait for awhile, but he didn't mention like how many more minutes awhile was, and he promised to go back to me when done. 45 minutes later, I was still waiting, then I decided to ask him again, and he replied that the room SETTLED ALREADY some time ago. He didn't even bother to let me know tho he promised me before. Disappointing.

Moreover, it was written that the bed was a double bed. But I got a single bed combined which is not comfortable for a solo traveller. When I confirmed this, the front office asked me to upgrade my room for IDR 100K to get a real double bed. Annoying.

However, if you want to chill and get the room, this hotel is perfect. Not so close to the beach but worth money.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
74,Not Recommended-Chose another hotel-Not a 4 star,20,July 2018,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 days(start of July) which advertised themselves as 4 stars.Having travelled the world and stayed in other 4 stars around the world I think they don't have a clue about the star rating as the standard would not have even been a 3 star in other places around the world yet the price doesn't reflect the poor standard.There's no respect to other guests peacefulness,the noise at 2am,banging on doors,screaming in hallway was completely disrespectful.Employees struggled with English.Food standard is very poor-if you come from a western country you might not want to have breakfast over there.We've struggled to see some positives-Not a recommended hotel-Chose another option and check the reviews.The general manager's response to reviews appears to lack willingness to seriously make changes.So once again guys chose another hotel it's too expensive for some random service.We were happy to leave and promised to never stay over there again.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
75,Price shows the quality,20,July 2018,"It’s a good place only for sleeping. Location is just next to the fitness seminyak but it is far from the beach unless you use own transfer. Experience I had was satisfied with the price.. Staff were very nice, but house keepers were not professional as he just entered in my room while I’m in a balcony. What if I was taking a shower? Bed was comfortable king bed, a bath room has hand soaps, shampoo & treatment these are attached to the wall. I’m sure we don’t usually use of them, so I prefer they take them off then put cotton wad, etc.. in stead. Seems 90% of customers were Asian, most of them were locals and Chinese customer while I was there. As I stayed in this hotel just to sleep before the flight, it was Just okay but it’ll be impossible to enjoy the vacation mood. Even I spend my time out of the hotel but still, I prefer the hotels located in the walking distance from the seminyak beach and surrounded full of bars!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
76,Good rooms for good price,50,July 2018,"Staff was very friendly.
The hotel is new and the rooms big enough for staying. The hotel is on the main street and you can reach seminyak centro in 15 minutes walk way. We had a little problem in our room and the staff solved it on the best way. They were helpful and very guestfriendly. Thank you again",Sense Sunset Seminyak
77,Pathetic service,10,July 2018,"Pathetic service.room was very small

78,Very Poor experience,20,July 2018,"Very disappointed!The rooms were small with a balcony but no chairs to sit outside.Complimentary coffee and tea were provided but no milk!! I wished I took a picture of the dirty toilet when we checked but the noise...what can I say!!! Guests mainly from Asia and India were so loud even late at night ,no respect for other guests who needed to sleep..let alone manners which were non- existent!! Some staff at reception didn't understand English and kept looking at each other or getting someone else to answer..honestly the service was very poor.After reading all the reviews where the manager replied that she will address the noise (months ago)..well it was obvious that there were no actions taken as we only left 3 days ago..Will not recommend this hotel to anyone..great pics on the website but very misleading. Christine-New Zealand",Sense Sunset Seminyak
79,Not a recommended hotel,10,June 2018,"Rooms is poor and dirty, no refrigerator, staff not friendly, dirty towels, table there were a lot of ants.Hotel is not worthy as a 4 star hotel.There is no convenient store nearby hotel. The only good thing about this hotel is they have back door to connect to Seminyak area",Sense Sunset Seminyak
80,Not as expected,20,June 2018,"Very gutted! Although the location is relatively good, the condition of the rooms is poor and are not cleaned daily, they only make the bed. We believed our room was cleaned everyday however were given dirty towels and the clean sheets were always marked. They were only replaced when we rung and complained. Lots of inconsiderate other guests who were really noisy, you were able to hear a lot of outside noise which you don’t normally in any other hotel.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
81,Comfortable stay at the mainroad,30,June 2018,"This Hotel is a nice place to stay in Seminyak. The pool is beautiful and they have fitness room with 3 gym maschines. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. My room was on the 5th floor and on the main road side, so it was a little noisy. If you are looking for a quite and romantic place to stay, I would recommend another Hotel. But this one is good for a stop over and it is located nearby good restaurants where you can eat local and international food. The beach can be reached by foot within a 20 mins walk.

83,It has its Pros and Cons,30,May 2018,"Overall, Sense Sunset Seminyak was a good hotel. It has a lot of pros and cons which I will highlight however overall it provided good service and a comfortable bed.

Pros:
SSS (Sense Sunset Seminyak) is close to most tourist attractions in Seminyak (within 2km walk).
It has a great pool, which is the highlight as you walk in.
The staff are very friendly and welcoming, they changed our room for us several times as we were not happy with certain aspects in other rooms i.e. no open window in the Superior room, and one room was too close to the lobby. They helped a lot at breakfast and even used some ingredients we bought from Bali Deli to make our eggs.
Beds are clean and comfortable and I had no trouble sleeping sound in the bed.
The hotel itself is beautiful inside and has all you need for a good stay, the rooms are spacious for two people and the shower is a good large size.

Cons:
The pool is built in an atrium style, which echoes a lot when there are a lot of people, so don’t expect to sleep sound early in the evening if there are a lot of people by the pool. Similarly in the morning if there is a large group leaving for tours.
Breakfast needs to be revised as there is mainly Chinese foods. Maybe more Western foods for other guests.
Cleanliness was good however you need to take a bit more care in the details, like cleaning the shower head and around the basin. A little Caustic acid should do the trick.
WiFi keeps kicking you out, so a quick IT Consultant should help.

Overall, beautiful hotel with good service and minor defects!!! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and weren’t too disappointed.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
84,Very convenient,40,May 2018,"Good location. Along the main road, sunset road. Room is clean and just nice for 2. The design of the hotel is good. Pool in the middle of the hotel. Receptionist is friendly. Free parking for the guests. Convenient store is just across the road and petrol station is near walking distance from the hotel.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
85,Worst stay in Bali out of 4 hotels,10,May 2018,"I just got here less than 12h ago and i already HATE that place. I asked for a quiet room and but i can hear EVERY SINGLE NOISE going on in the hallway. Doors opening, ppl in the other room. Ppl screaming in the hallway 2 floors below it is absolutely RIDICULOUS. As for the rooms, although they appear nice and spacious it only took a couple of minutes to notice that there was a big lack of maintenance. Basic amenities like SHOWER GEL,TOILET PAPER, shower caps, face cloths were missing. Finaly to add to the horror of staying there, the service at the restaurant was very slow and the food gave me food poisoning. JUST AVOID IT OK?!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
86,Spend a bit more $ on a nicer place,10,May 2018,"Not a great experience. Staff could not explain things- and im talking 5 of them. Hotel definitly needs 2 to 3 staff who can speak english and understand english clearly...this lead to frustrstion as no 1 could explain 1 thing re the booking to me..room - bathroom filthy....so dirty...bins dirty...put me off. Breakfast terrible...stale bread...not suited to a westerner only asian guest...you had to ask for hand towels on request.room service- why call it room service if then you had to go down to restaurant to pay...beds so uncomfortable. Asking for directions to oberoi st- too hard- they didnt know how to explain it..asking for a reciept- again no understanding...too hard..food in restaurant average...poor lil girl wanted icecream- nope- the fridge wasnt working- they were off...not clear to that particular guest..and the noise factor- omg...many japanese guests that were left to be allowed to scream day in day out..10pm at night- they were soooo loud, screaming down the hallways and management did not address this..too bad for other guests..overall its a cheap hotel- in every which way...far out from centre..cabbed it daily- shuttle an issue..dont even bother staying...there are nicer hotels...i booked this by accident...yep not great.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
87,"Better place, better stay",50,May 2018,"I was stay in there 4 days and 3 night.. what a greatfull experiences, because the room is very clean.. the hospitality is very nice.. also the bedroom is nice.. good location because in the middle of city.. 10 minutes to beach by car (depends to the traffic).. next time will be stay in this hotel..👍🏼👍🏼",Sense Sunset Seminyak
88,oh dear,10,May 2018,"where do i start. the location whilst central is on one of the busiest roads in bali.it is a 30 minute walk+ to the beach.the hotel bus only runs twice a day there , not back! there is no 10% discount for drinks as per its advertisement and the driver spoke little or no english so of there was a bar he could not tell us.the staff were sometimes helpful,sometimes not! staff wandered around the hotel during the night,how do we know,they were on their walkie talkies outside our room at 2am! when setting breakfast in the morning at 0630 they were not what you would call quiet and probably woke the hotel up. when called upon to quieten down noisy guests they failed to do so. the chinese / korean ?? guests were obnoxiously loud through the night every night! they took bad manners and disrespect to a new level.the chinese guests , women old enough to know better, arrived at 2am and proceeded to scream the place down with no staff intervention . the design of the hotel is such that ALL noise reverberates and echos throughout the hotel . if you want a quiet hotel do NOT go here !! we upgraded and thank goodness we did as some of the rooms were tiny. the room was tired and not kept to a good standard, mould around the shower, room service was sketchy and bedding was not changed , towels were stained . there was no discount to guests for beer or food.the holiday rep for mercure direct on first meet seemed ok , soon found out different as we had to organise our own trips. there was no furniture on the balcony to sit on ? no complimentary drinks in the fridge. the bathroom was not cleaned properly. thank goodness we had the beach half an hour away walking as no way can you relax here . sadly this is not a hotel i will stay at again",Sense Sunset Seminyak
89,No peace to be found here,10,May 2018,"Image I first arrived it might have been nice it I’d had the features I the hotel explained to me. Where is the restaurant gym and kids club for example? When does the shuttle leave?
I was jet lagged and the kids in the pool screamed and shouted no stop for about three hours which echoed through the building. Did I mention these were 12 year olds?
The guests on my floor who were part of the same group from China were extremely noisy out in the corridors until really late at night. And their Zigaretten smoke cane into my room. I complained so many times but they remained inconsiderate and obnoxious. The hallways are all titles so the sound resonates throughout the hotel. The rooms are also tiled so you can hear everyone’s movements above you.
The room itself is nice but the bathroom has mould in the grout and the towels are old. It doesn’t deserve four stars and I regret using all my gewebt flyer points to stay here. I’m glad I only stayed two days. The location is also very far from town yet they forgot to mention to me when the shuttle bus was. Dont come her unless you’re planning on being out and about and partying a lot because you won’t be able to relax or get much sleep.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
90,Not recomended for any type of visit,10,May 2018,Terrible food with no taste and no variety. All the time there is noise that can keep you awake all night.

91,"Great value, but a little noisey",50,April 2018,"The hotel, it's facilities and all the staff were Great.
Location wise it was only a short taxi ride from the beach and the lively streets. They do offer a free shuttle but we never used this.
The breakfast was Ok, bit of a mixed bag. But there is an egg chef to keep you happy 👍
Only problem we found was that it could be quite noisey, but after ringing reception things were quickly sorted. Mates away on holiday would be perfect but if looking for peace and quiet maybe find somewhere smaller.
But for the price, this place was great",Sense Sunset Seminyak
92,Terrible Motel on busy Dual Carriageway,20,February 2018,"Booked this place with Mecury Holidays UK ,who advertised it at 4*. It is 2* at best . I will explain . The first night was spent in a supposed De Luxe Room (after travelling 24 hours on 2 flights with KLM). We spent the night lying on top of the bed as air conditioning did not work and there was a window in room but no opener to cool things down .Woken at 6-00am by very noisy Chinese Guests going on their daily tours (This happened every morning for the 14 Nights we spent there). Next morning l insisted on a room change to the De Luxe Room l booked.. We were given the room that we booked but only after demanding to speak to an English speaking Duty Manager. .Now about the food in this place . We booked Full Board with Mecury Direct and that consisted everyday for 14 days,,lunchtime steak and chips(lukewarm) lamb chop and chips or salmon and chips, No starters allowed and no deserts allowed . After 3 days no lamb chop so only steak and chips and salmon and chips afternoon and nightime for the next 11 days .If you wanted an ICE Cream you had to pay for it .It was diabolical really. Would never cross the doors of this place again .",Sense Sunset Seminyak
93,Don’t get a room on the bottom floor,30,April 2018,"Hotel is nice , pool is good for having a refreshing dip. Very well presented. Staff extremely friendly and useful where possible.

Stay would have been fine if it wasn’t for a few bad points.

Room on bottom floor right next to kitchen all you can hear from 7am is Chinese people screaming and banging plates and knives and forks about. That being said though we made reception aware , the reception offered a room change.

There are not enough irons available so take your own unless you want to wear creased clothes most of the time , and if you do manage to get your hands on an iron be careful you don’t kill yourself , see attached pic",Sense Sunset Seminyak

The bed is so comfort, spacious room and bathroom, full channels TV, and suprisingly hair-dryer and safety box provided.
Unfortunately our room is facing city view, noise from the street can be heard clearly. The location is awesome. There are various restaurants, bars, minimart and spas surround. If you love yoga, you can try yoga class at Prana.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

I arrived at night about 10PM, but my booking was not ready yet, so waiting for about 30 menit. The room (2nd floor) was moist, maybe not getting enough sunlight. I cant closed my bathroom glass door. Its rust and hard to closed. I afraid to force it. So, I guess there's never guest stay at that room until the glass door rusted.
Unfortunately, there's chinese group at that day and they were so noisy. The good thing only the location. There's so many hotel with best value.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

97,Nice place on a busy strip!,50,February 2018,"First, my review is long so I want this in the first line: Budi in the restaurant is wonderful.

The rooms were clean and large enough for me as a solo traveler and probably fine for a couple sharing the same bed. Bathroom was compact but fine. Wonderful fluffy fresh smelling towels. No closet or drawer space in deluxe room but plenty of room to hang my clothes. I got a special deal on Expedia, Breakfast included for under $25 per night during rainy season. So this is not an American 5 Star resort but it was a very comfortable place to launch our Bali adventures from.

They can help you find a reasonably priced driver. Reliable laundry with very reasonable prices. About 1 mile to beach. Lots of restaurants in a 4-5 block radius-we often spent less than $20 for dinner. Massage places nearby are friendly and reasonably priced.

We really loved our free breakfasts! While there was as previously reported a limited cereal selection, my question is why would you eat that when there is a wonderful buffet of Indonesian, Chinese and Indian fare, fresh fruit and tasty coffee. The highlight of our breakfast each morning was our conversations with Budi who works in the restaurant. She is a wonderful welcoming ambassador not only for the hotel, but for Bali. So delightful, helpful and obviously dedicated to the venue. I am not exactly sure what her job title is, but she should be involved managing the place!!!! We will definitely return.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
98,Lovely stay and friendly staff,40,May 2017,"I stayed for about five days at the Swiss-Belinn Seminayak hotel (now known as Sense Sunset Seminyak). I came across it on-line while I was organizing a visit to Bali. The place was simple, but it had everything I needed for a good stay in the city. The staff at the reception desk accommodated me right away even when I arrived way ahead of schedule. Initially I was given a room that looked out to the back part of the hotel, lined up with shops and restaurants. That's why I would usually take the back door to explore the area. The hotel also has a restaurant, which serves lovely typical Indonesian dishes. I stayed in this hotel first for only three days, then I flew to and stayed in Jogjakarta for three days, and then I returned to this hotel again for another two days. During my first stay I was given a room that looked out to the back of the hotel (as I have already mentioned), but when I returned three days after I was given a room that looked out to the pool area inside the hotel. I wouldn't recommend any of the rooms facing the pool area for it tends to be very noisy even when you close the balcony window/door of your room. On the other hand, what I like about this place, aside from the low price of its accommodation, is its location. Shops and restaurants are just behind it. The staff also help you arrange your tours around Bali. The food at the restaurant is also good. I just hope that they could find a way to control the rowdy people in the swimming pool area, especially at night.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
99,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,10,January 2018,"Well where do i start? Oh yeah, at the driver grom the hotel picking us up from airport 2 hours(!!!!) after we landed!

101,value for money but pay for what you get,30,January 2018,"for what we needed Sense sunset was an ideal resort for our stay in Seminyak.

POSITIVES:
- very convenient location, 15minutes walk from Legian (cocoon nightclub) in one direction and then 20minutes walk to the heart of seminyak (eat street). this made it very easy talk walk in either direction exploring new restaurants and markets that were around. Very close to shopping strips, mini marts, markets and eateries.
- we booked a 1 hour massage at the Sense Sunset for 180,000 rupiah, and it was divine. Decent price, very clean rooms, professional service and an outstanding massage
- $64AUD per room per night (including breakfast) for a 1 bedroom + 1 bathroom double room, which is incredibly cheap. Very basic rooms with just a bed, TV and bathroom. Big downside is no bar fridge to store your drinks which i will talk about in the negatives.
- The beds were very comfortable, and i know this may seem like an unusual comment but for certain family members who have trouble sleeping could not praise these beds enough.
- Staff service was A grade the very best. Nothing was too hard for the staff at Sense sunset, arriving within 10 minutes of your call at your room. Supplied bar fridges, extra towels at request for no extra charge, towels, water, international plugs, taxi service organisation.

NEGATIVES:
- the rooms dont come with bar fridge which is quiet strange. No where to store cold waters, drinks and food, limiting the amount of drinks and food that could be brought around the pool during lunch.
- although there was a cooked breakfast, it was very basic and similar each day with not a lot of variety. consisting of mixed rice, noodles, omelette station, roasted potatoes and minimal cereal selection. The breakfast really needs to be improved as it was average and could do with a bit more of a variety (perhaps yogurts, cereals etc.).
- This resort had no facilities apart from a lap pool. Encourages you to walk the streets and get out of the hotel. Had a ""gym"" which consisted of 2 treadmill and that's it, was very below par and needs to be improved as you cannot classify and advertise this as a gym.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
102,very nice hotel near to the airport,40,January 2018,"This hotel is close to a main street but inside you feel like in holidays. it is open but there is no street noise. clean rooms, friendly staff and a nice pool. only the wifi connection in my room is kind of bad. but for Bali it deserves the 4* status.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
103,"Grand deluxe room is good, but superior is not",30,December 2017,"I stayed in grand deluxe room pool side. For traveller who loves to sleep until noon, don’t choose this room because it will be noisy in the morning (the sound from the restaurant and people swimming). I travelled with children so it’s okay, we woke up early in the morning either. Grand deluxe room had chiller & hairdryer but superior not, and my sister got a room with “garden” view (just random garden, trees, not set up garden) in superior room.
The service need to be improved because they cleaned up my room and didn’t change the towels (but they take the dirty towels, happen to me twice), and I need to ask to receptionist twice to get my new towel.

The food was okay. The menu was suitable for family. And no slippers for free, you may buy it in the hotel.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

The Seminyak beach is apprx 20-25 mins walking distance.

Overall good hotel.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
105,Good and Bad,30,December 2017,"The stay was ok, wish it was better because I'm a long way from home over the Christmas period.

The room is clean, cleaned every day. Comfy bed and curtain to block out the light. The pool is also very good and enjoyable.

I had to request a change of room as I was on the ground floor next to the pool and kitchen this was quite noisy. I was moved to the 5th floor which was much better.

The WiFi is terrible it doesn't work at all I had to use my phone data. The room we moved to on the 5th floor phone didn't work so when we ordered room service we had to go down to the ground floor.

I ordered a tuna sandwich without egg. The sandwich came with egg. I had to go back down the stairs to advise I didn't order this. The kitchen wouldn't change my order or refund me. So I payed for a meal I didn't touch. Very unhappy about this.
Service is quite slow i.e when you ask for something or a question prepare to wait a while.

There was a man on the front desk who was very helpful.

I think overall it was an expensive stay for what it provided.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Bathroom was clean with everything provided even your toothbrush flannels and towels as well as a basic toiletries.
Breakfast was plentiful and provided many local style dishes,fruit ,cereal and toast etc..pool was a welcome respite from the fantasic weather.
From me this was the holiday of a lifetime and one I will remember fondly ,as I will remember the lovely staff here",Sense Sunset Seminyak
107,Excellent for 3 star,40,December 2017,"Good clean accommodation.
Negative would be lack of storage space for clothes and only 4 hangers in open hanging space.

108,"Friendly staff, Ok hotel",30,October 2017,"We checked in very early in the morning and had to pay an early check in fee which worked out to be the same price as the room was. Our room was right by the pool which I was excited about at first but after our first morning I was ready to request a room change. The staff were out early in the morning getting the breakfast area ready and dragging chairs around which echoed through the pool courtyard. After the tables were set up the people started to come for breakfast (around 6am) that were going on tours, they were so loud and noisy it made sleeping in past 6:30am virtually impossible.

Food at breakfast was not very good at all, I wouldn't pay the extra amount to include breakfast. There are some really nice places a close walk from the hotel with more choices and much less people pushing their way to the food.

The rooms were clean and nice but I found the bed very uncomfortable. Not all rooms include a fridge which was a bit shocking but the hotel wasn't the most expensive. We added a few more nights for someone in our party and it was much cheaper to go and book online rather than go to reception and book there.

The hotel was generally clean but I did notice on one day that a food tray from breakfast was left out the entire day next to the pool and and was quickly covered in ants. The plate wasn't moved until the early evening despite a number of staff members walking by it.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
109,Good value for money not 4 stars.,30,November 2017,"Overall a good, clean Hotel, but not a 4 stars as advertised on some sites.
Our room was close to the Reception area and near the open ""smoking"" area, and most nights was awfully noisy until midnight. The room itself was fairly small and had no cupboards to hanging your clothes in. Having a balcony was great, except for the absence of any furniture in it.
The pool was clean and surrounded by tropical plants.

The breakfast room / restaurant was adequate although for breakfast was very noisy and at times crowded; breakfast catered mainly for Asian taste, with most dishes very, VERY spicy!

The Hotel was close to a Supermarket and to various other shops, including local restaurants, however, to go to most places you will need transport.
The beach wasn't too far away, however it was too hot and humid to walk 20 - 25 min. to the beach and it was best to get a taxi - a taxi to Seminyak beach would cost us AU$ 3.00.
From the Hotel to Kuta, were the big Shopping Malls and night life is, a taxi will cost you around 50000 rupiah (AU$ 5.00) providing you get a taxi with a meter.

Staff were amazing! Most of the staff could speak English and were only too eager to help.
The Staff smiles and helpfulness made it all acceptable and we had a good time. Special thanks to Hera and Surya for their great service at the front desk.

Terima kasih!!! (Thank you) Leo",Sense Sunset Seminyak
110,NOISY!!!,20,October 2017,"On first impressions we were met by friendly helpful staff and the room looked fine (on the ground floor next to the pool looked idyllic) but this soon turned around. Woken at 6.30 am by noisy other guests who were noisy and inconsiderate (I will expand later on) So noisy I had to ask to be moved. The staff were apologetic and ever so helpful and moved us to the top floor. Here's the thing my main complaint about this hotel is the soundproofing is terrible, The windows/doors are single glazed and the noise from the pool comes into your room anytime the pool is used. The corridors lack any sound deadening and so any noise generated (which was almost every night at any time from 12.30 past midnight to 2am from the many Chinese group tours and also the groups of Indonesian Muslim girls coming in screaming and shouting. Attempts from myself and other guests to remind them that others were trying to sleep fell on deaf ears and on one night I lost it and ran into the corridor screaming near naked apart from my pants at them to shut up-that seemed to work!) The issue is the staff are excellent, the rooms generally are nice but its not a conducive holiday hotel for a quiet break. Its poorly designed and built. I would not go there again only because of the hotel construction itself and the noisiness of the other guests.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
111,Comfortable hotel with friendly staff,40,October 2017,"A clean and very comfortable hotel. I can't really comment on the location other than great for the airport as I didn't really explore Seminyak. I used as a base to go on trips outside of the location.
However my room was a good size with a really large and comfortable double bed. Bathroom clean and well equipped with towels and toiletries. Hot water (which if you travel around in Bali isn't always a given).
I didn't have breakfast but instead choose to use the free coffee and kettle provided and sat on the balcony overlooking the pool.

I stayed on 2nd floor and the room was facing the pool.. the room was nice, overall clean and everything was working properly.. The only problem i had was the sound of other people was too loud, especially children, and maybe i heard a bit of constructing noise.. other than that, the place was awesome.. the pool was VERY CLEAN & CLEAR.. i didn't have the time to try the gym..",Sense Sunset Seminyak
114,Really good value for money.,40,October 2017,"I stayed at this hotel with my partner for two nights.

It’s not 5 star so don’t expect that. It is comfortable and the staff are very helpful and friendly. The pool area is lovely at breakfast and the food is pretty good. Mainly Indonesian options for breakfast but all were very nice.

I think the hotel very much deserves the 4 rating I gave it because it’s a very good standard for the price.

I recommend using the hotels website for online booking or if in the area like we were you just go in and ask. That way you will get the best deal. Many of the sites offering this place were more expensive than what I paid",Sense Sunset Seminyak
115,Nice budget hotel,40,August 2017,"I love the room, clean and spacious. The breakfast had many choice. Staff at FO is friendly but not with security staff. They judge book by its cover, will be better if they treat their guest with smile, friendly and polite. the price determines the quality, i know why other hotel can sell their room more expensive because they sell their service also",Sense Sunset Seminyak
116,Bali with the family,40,October 2017,"When with husband daughter and grand daughter we stayed in two separate rooms during our 11 night stay, Rooms were great . Serviced daily including bottled water each day. There was the loveliest girl on reception wish i could remember her name im sure it started with an O. She spoke great English and was glad when i seen her on reception and needed to ask question, If you go out the back door it takes you to a supermarket plus easier to get taxi from the back. We had a room overlooking the pool which was great expect for the noise even late at night from rude loud guest which is no fault of the motel, Would stay here again,",Sense Sunset Seminyak
117,Clean and calm location,40,August 2017,"Stayed few nights in twin room as solo traveler.
Pros : quieter location yet close to centre of seminyak. Room amenities well maintained. comfortable and cozy. Good swimming pool.

Cons: The room which i stayed is located on same level as lobby and doesn't have clear window, thus its damp which is obvious every-time when opening the door. Meal at restaurant wasnt so good. didnt like having still cleaning the restaurant area at 10am when you are taking meal there.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

122,Poor Customer Service,20,May 2017,"Before I got to the hotel, I had spoke with one of the manager's through booking. com and told her that it was a honeymoon trip and she promised to do something for us. When I got there and asked for the manager, the staff could hardly speak English and I wasn't able to speak to anyone, as I was determined to enjoy my holiday which I absolutely did regardless of the poor customer service I received at this hotel. I would only recommend this hotel if you are going on trips and just need place to stay I wouldn't recommend you stay for two weeks as my trip was only 8 days and trust me that was enough. The staff member who was the worst was Poklen, he has no customer service at all. Beware of him. Breakfast was decent, but the location is fairly ok, not too bad, me & my husband were able to explore other places and prefer Jimbaran. Just to inform you as well, the Wi-Fi is very poor and slow, the best time to get on the Wi-Fi is at 2am when everyone is sleeping.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Once we entered the room, same old stuff! Cockroaches! 🤦🏻‍♀️
The next day in the morning,
I was still in the bedroom and the housekeeping insisted to come in. And I even hv to scream to tell him to not come in he insisted saying house keeping And trying to open the door.

131,Looked better than it was.,30,February 2017,"Stayed just one night and first impressions suggested a bargain for the price. Although still inexpensive, our twin room was not that clean. One of the beds had a lot of dirty marks on it which is never good to see. Even if they were old stubborn stains and the bedding had been washed, in combination with the damp feeling, perhaps it is time to replace some bedding. Same goes for the towels. Some hair on the floor too. Perhaps we had the budget room. Did not have chance to use pool and didn't have breakfast so unsure about those. Staff seemed pleasant although on departure, my deposit was held back from me until walkiw talkie confirmation that the room was ok - it was but it felt like I had done something wrong the way she kept hold of the money until given the all clear.

The hotel was clean, had friendly staff and was not expensive. It is located on the main road and close to shopping strips. On a negative side, some of the guests were very loud and some were skipping the line where they cook the eggs for breaky. Other than that, I will happily stay there again.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

137,Best Value for Money,50,January 2017,"The staff were really polite and very helpful especially Krisna and Bella. Room was clean. Breakfast was delicious. The rolls from breakfast were amazing. Value for money.
The only issue is that some of the rooms did not have a fridge. Considering the heat in Bali, I think every room should have a fridge.
There was nowhere to plug hairdryer or any electrical appliances in the bathroom.
Iron and ironing board didn't work properly.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

The staff were exceptionally accomodating and kind. The restaurant downstairs was so reasonably priced and the staff were super friendly.
The room was great for $23 ..had everything you would need. If im ever looking for budget acconodation id defonately stay again.
The only strange thing was the cost of the spa there!!! It was INSANELY expensive. It was in the wrong hotel. When guests pay for a room for $30 a night theres no way they are going to pay $80 for massages...think they have got the wrong market and if they put cheaper prices they will get more customers!",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Dirty bathroom floor.
Dusty room floor.

I asked for pool view, instead, they gave me a room with view of artificial plants.

142,Excellent service. Average Facilities,40,December 2016,"In general, the hotel does have very polite and helpful staff who remedy situations rather quickly. During my check out, the lady at the check out counter forgot to inform me that I still had 2 shirts at the dry cleaners (I believe they do not have a coordinated system between the laundry and check out departments). So, I flew back home and realized my clothes were missing and called them back to ask how to resolve it. Herry, the manager on duty, couriered the clothes to me without delay and it reached me about a week later. Excellent service.

The point is, while the service in general may not be fantastic, they do fix problems rather quickly and efficiently. (But do note that this problem is not confined to this hotel and is inherent in most hotels in Bali, even in the five star hotels). Overall I must say I had a reasonably comfortable time at this hotel for the amount I paid (around AUD 85 per night based on a special promotion price).

The bedroom was clean. However, if you are expecting super clean and more spacious bathrooms, as well as a fridge, with a great view, then this hotel may not be for you. This hotel will suit you best if you're out partying most of the time, and using the hotel just as a place of rest - period. Expect good service, that's all and a clean small place to rest. The guys at the hotel do try very hard to accommodate guests as well",Sense Sunset Seminyak
143,Good price and strategic location,40,January 2017,"I booked the hotel through a travel agents for about 90 rooms total for an event. The room is good but the breakfast is not so good, frankly.

145,Great hotel and price!,40,December 2016,"Location was alright, about 10-15 minute walk to get to the main streets where the popular restaurants and bars are. The check in was quite slow because of other impatient and demanding customers making it hard for the receptionists. Most of the staff were friendly and helpful at most times. The rooms were clean and basic. As far as noise goes, it wasn't much of a bother for us, we were able to sleep quite soundly. The breakfast was also good! Quite a bit of variety to choose from. The gym was okay although I thought the space was very small. The pool was lovely and clean. Check out was easy and smooth.

All in all, this hotel has exceeded my expectations. Would greatly recommend staying here!",Sense Sunset Seminyak

When we got in the room, floor dusty and sheet got dirt marked. We can watch our favorite movie because television channel was under maintenance until 2nd day of our stay.

- We went out for dinner and we keep our room turned ON the electricity because we still charge on our gadget, after that I asked to a man on reception for another room key and he arrogantly said 'we don't have any key left, we can not give you another one', okay fine.
- Elevator operate only one, so little bit spare time to wait.
- Check out in the early morning, we should wait for more than 15 minutes for checking the room and waiting again for the breakfast box preparation, I've already called from the other night for breakfast box ready at reception at 05.30 and we received at 05.45, and just only 2 cold breads and fruits... its that what you called BF? for me its so wasted waiting.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
148,Good hotel in Seminyak,40,December 2016,Stayed for 3 nights when we first got into Bali. Good hotel with friendly staff and air con room. Only issue being the distance into the busy Seminyak area. About a 30 min walk or roughly 30k in a taxi on the meter. We found most days it was easy enough to walk in. There are some decent restaurants around the area though.,Sense Sunset Seminyak

Then i have to stand up waiting for my key until they gave me the room key at 14:10.

I think nobody expect this kind of service after a long hours trip and the only thing that you want is having a good rest...

My room was situated at the ground floor in front of the pool... and i believed they don't have a sound proof room concept at all...!! For sure i can't sleep since i can clearly hear kids playing outside, people talking loud in the corridor, guest next door singing, the mechanics doing maintenance using drill....

Staff was also very helpful but I'd recommend that the cleaning staff clean the rooms a bit better and maybe change the sheets every once in a while or so. They only make the bed and sweep in eye shot view but don't actually clean the room properly. If you want some quiet in the mornings it might be better to choose the rooms facing the street as the room facing the pool is also facing the restaurant area which can be a bit noisy.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Extremly noisy as well. When people were in the pool it sounded like they were in our room shouting, even though we lived on the top floor.

Downsides include poor quality breakfast, and poor sound proofing.

157,Cosy cheap getaway,30,November 2016,"My partner and I stayed here for our first time in Bali. We stayed in the grand deluxe room with breakfast included and a balcony with a pool vie . The staff are absolutely lovely and do everything to make you feel at home.
Room was nice; quite small and a bit shabby (few blood stains on the net curtain on the patio doors and a few marks on the floor etc but nothing major. King bed was huge and pretty comfortable.
Breakfast was not great as far as Aussie/English breakfast standards go but if you like fried rice/noodles for breakkie you're onto a winner. I ended up buying myself cereal at the mini mart and bringing it to breakfast to have with their milk.
Airport transfers were extra 175000IDR (apparently expensive as far as taxis go) but the drivers were wonderful.
The little kitchen out the back for dinner and such was a really cute little place and really cheap for food and drink. Food wasn't fabulous but you get what you pay for really.
Would definitely come back to Bali but next time would definitely pay the extra for our own villa as the pool area here was too small to spend the day by (~6 beds around it and only sunny in the morning).",Sense Sunset Seminyak

The staff welcomed me very warmly and answered my questions about getting around Seminyak. It's about a 10 minute walk to seminyak beach, convenient location. The only downside was that there was a lot of noise on my floor late at night on the first night but other than that, comfy bed, great pool and lovely people :) would highly recommend it.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

What gives Sense Sunset an advantage is its location. There are lots of places to see around the area of the hotel.
The breakfast was so so.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
162,Do not tricked with those nice pictures..,20,October 2016,"The reason why i chose this hotel to accommodate my holiday is because they pictured this hotel so good. My fault is i was expecting much from the pictures. At the first sight, this place looked so good with a unique design of their marbles lobby. Until we start to enter the hotel. Reception desk located in the left corner, looked too minimalist, we was handled by a trainee personnel seems immature but its ok we know she's still learning BUT unfortunately the senior one isn't help anything.

Going up using elevator and you will find unattractive corridor towards your room.
i booked 1 family room with double bed in each room. yes we had double bed but it was two single bed combined together, its really uncomfortable for the kids that travel with us. When we opened the door to the room it had a bad smell from the toilet and lots of dirt stain in the bath room floor.

room lighting is not so good. We didn't got any view outside the window. really nothing to see outside. you cannot see to the right or the left from the window. you can only see a green grass wall that coincide with the window. the space from the wall to your window maybe only 20 cms.

There's no fridge and hair dryer. And the worst is we found a red stains (look like a blood stains) with some hair loss in the floor right under the couch. we didn't know what was that, we speculated it was only a what-so-ever red stain however it made us shocked at first and fortunately that was the last day we stayed there so we decided to not care. the stains also found out in the bed linen.

From that matters and all the dirt in the bath room. clearly these rooms aren't well maintained or hygienically cleansed. then it took a long time to check out. Again, because of the reception personnel are less responsive.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
163,"Good enough, but no soundproof",30,September 2016,"We stayed here for 4 nights. When we were back to the hotel to check in, we waited pretty long for the room to be ready (it was already 3 pm). But we appreciated the effort the hotel made by upgrading our room to grand deluxe, which is located on the pool balcony.

The first encounter we had when we were in the room is a small bug passing us on the floor. We had no idea where it came from.

The first 3 nights were okay, the last night we stayed was not. We realized that the building is not soundproof at all, and you could hear some people chatting downstairs (by the pool), so having the grand deluxe that has balcony wasn't really great for us. And unfortunately there were some loud tourists staying next to our room. It's almost midnight, and they were SO loud.

We called the front desk and asked them to handle that situation quickly. For their quick response, we appreciated that. I think the security went up to warn them, if I'm not mistaken.

Overall, it was a nice stay. But if you are looking for a quiet place to stay, this might not be it.

We wished that somehow the hotel could be more soundproof. That would make this place even better and of course, more convenient.

Coming back? Not so sure...",Sense Sunset Seminyak
164,Nice stay,40,September 2016,"Stayed for three nights, all the staff were very nice! Hotel was attractive and nice to stay in. Only downside was the bathroom, it needed a proper good clean.

The bed was large and comfy, helping us to get over jet lag quickly.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
165,"Hard to rate, Hard to judge, let me explain",30,September 2016,"Question is would I stay there again: Answer No But Wait there's More, let me explain
I like the place, dont get me wrong, the walls however are less than soundproof and the doors that open toward the pool, well there's another story.
IF YOU STAY HERE DO NOT GET A POOL BALCONY ROOM!!!!
the reason I say that is, there apparently is no curfew on the pool and yes guests use it all bloody night, and you hear it like they are next door as the noise echos around the atrium type area.
Now the hotel caters to a certain nationality, which is fine but there manners can be some what lacking, this encludes noisily using the pool all night, even the staff mentioned this, this is not the fault of the hotel, but should be considered if you are looking for a quiet get away, as they come and go throughout the night with slamming doors and talking in hall ways throughout the night.

The pool area is smallish and regularly packed especially late afternoon onward.

We ordered a massage, the young lady was very good, take note the massage is done in your room.

Location is good, we did stay there for a specific reason for its location alone.

Now if you can get an outer room this may be a different experience.

Breakfast wasn't bad, but again the food was catered toward there majority guests which is understandable. Thou a heads up saying they cook to order would be nice.

Staff were helpful and also appreciated a smile, which from what I saw didn't happen often!

Opinion will be divided on this place, but this is my opinion...Hope it helps",Sense Sunset Seminyak
166,Appalling excuse for a hotel...,10,August 2016,"Possibly one of the worst hotels I've come across.

Beginning with the immature and aloof personnel at reception certainly didn't make for a good first impression.

That was further confirmed with the 'suite' room which was a pitiful excuse for a suite. Mosquitoes are prevalent as well as some small cockroaches roaming about, clearly these rooms aren't well maintained or hygienically cleansed...

Immediately cancelled and went to another hotel!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
167,Just Out to Get Your Money,20,September 2016,"I booked a stay here the night before my arrival on Agoda and realized after booking that I had done one more day than I actually wanted. I tried calling Agoda, but was already in Bali and was having a hard time getting my phone to work. When I checked in I told the hotel what happened and they told me they wouldn't change the reservation and I had to pay for all the days. They told me to call Agoda so I did before check in and spoke with Agoda who called the hotel and asked the same thing and they said no that they wouldn't allow me to cancel the last night and that they were keeping my money for that night even though I wouldn't be using it.

I took the room and just counted it as a loss, but I was just left with a feeling that there was no compassion or understanding and they were just here to take my money, but not actually value me as a guest.

After checking into my room I had an issue with their wifi. The login they gave me worked and it said I was logged in but every time I tried to pull up a web page or connect to my companies server for work it wouldn't actually connect. I called the front desk to ask about this and the girl first said 'ya ya' and hung up the phone on me so I called again and they said that their internet guys would come to my room. The internet guys never came but the wifi ended up starting to work for five minutes then would cut out. Eventually it started working consistently, but slow.

The room itself wasn't too bad. It looked better in the pictures online, but it was still OK.

The wait staff in the restaurant was very nice.

Its a mixed bag I probably would like the hotel a lot better if I had felt I was treated like a guest and I didn't get that feeling in the beginning so that may have also tainted my outlook.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
168,Very budget hotel,20,September 2016,"It doesnt seems like the ones in the pictures. Rated 4 star hotel but quality of the room is really bad. It looks budget. Overall clean but would not recommend!

Room was ok, not too spacious for standard one.

Room service was not too god, order nasi rendang and tom yum gong, however tom yum is 80% water but luckily nasi rendang have better taste.

170,Bad double room,10,August 2016,"Already the second time i stay at this hotel and second time too i got a unexpected room. I had booked a double bed room, hmm okay I was given a double bed, but it was only two single beds held together with a bedcover. So terrible and very embarassing for a class 4 hotel.
And another repulsing thing is on the bed cover there are stains of blood and for 3 days I spent there was never replaced, only trimmed.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
171,"Great value for money, clean and central",50,June 2016,"Clean and central location, 100% worth the money, would stay again. Access straight to seminyak center through the back exit of the hotel, didn't realise this until last day but its so easy. Also commonwealth bank by the back exit worth using. 24hr room service, pool in shade but free access and transfers to the beach club if you book at reception in advance. Enjoyed our stay.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
172,Would give no star if possible,10,August 2016,"Room; Damp, bugs on the bed, warm water was cold, no fridge, lots of dirt in the bathroom, rock hard pillows and have to basically bag for more toilet paper. Service; is the worst. Ask one question to the front desk, they send you down stairs, want a key per person, not possible. Ordering a taxi they get confused and are unhelpful, no taxis? Give me another option, in the room they had no menu, to room service or activities, only some rooms had a comment card. Room service, DO NOT EAT, they don't know or have most of the stuff and when it arrives it is all under cooked, would never come back and would actively discourage people from staying here.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
173,Clean and comfy,40,August 2016,Great experience. clean room and friendly staffs. We stayed for 2 nights and it was great hotel with good access to go anywhere because it's on Sunset Road. The hotel is easy to find and there's a minimart nearby..,Sense Sunset Seminyak
174,Very noisy room,10,August 2016,"I booked online for 2 nights. They run out the no smoking room, so upgrade me in pool view deluxe. Was so happy and thankful.
The room sound proof is very bad, you can hear people talk, they put very loud corridor music and it start at 7 am. It's really upsetting when I talked to the reception about how loud it is and he said it's their standard.
My room just right beside the restaurant, it's really noisy.
The bed quality is no too good, I rate 6 from 10. The other hotel in same area and similar room rate has better bed quality.
I suggest when you need good sleep for your holiday or business this hotel is the last option.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
175,More then expected for a budget price!!!,40,August 2016,"I booked Sense Sunset for 1 night and was so impressed i booked again for an additional 2 nights on my way home.

The hotel is beautifully presented both interior and exterior. Very clean in public areas and in room including linen and towels. Rooms are spacious and beds are SOOO comfortable. Bathroom is large and shower pressure is good. The mornings were a little noisy when located on lower levels with the chatter and what sounded like plates clanging at around 6am. Rooms on level 3 and up were much better and let you sleep in.

Pool is very nice, nestled under trees which is good if you like shade however left the water temperature a little on the cooler side.

Location is good. Its about a 15 minute stroll to the town centre, restaurants and bars. The walk is pleasant and on main roads with lots of shops along the way. The beach is approx 25 minutes in the opposite direction. The hotel does have a car service for a good price and the security actually even offered to lend usher bike to get around which i thought was great!

Staff were hit and miss but majority are friendly and very accommodating.Had a little bit of trouble when booking additional nights as wanted to stay in the same room, unfortunately had to check out at 11am and check back in at 2pm.I also did a trip to another island in Indonesia and the hotel did store my 2 suitcases at no additional cost which i was not expecting and very appreciative of.

Overall the stay was pleasant and great value for money. I would stay there again and making a base when travelling around in Indonesia.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
176,Good and clean hotel,40,August 2016,"Nice and beautiful hotel, nice to stay, room is small though...I have 1 complain, the chinese tourist too noisy at night and the sounds just echoing throughout the hotel. Other than that this hotel is nice, I would come back again.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

My room now is overlooking to the pool (in front of my balcony). I love how clean the room! Even though I can hear a bit of music from the next room, but I'll be fine with it. 1 night here was around 350,000-490,000 rupiah. And I must say that's totally worth the value.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
178,"Clean and friendly staff, ciggerete smoke inside room",30,August 2016,"Hotel is fairly nice and clean for the price. Near seminyak area. We stayted in the standard room we booked through agoda for 3 nights. Hotel was full on the day we came and we only got double beds for both of our rooms (we wanted twin beds). My room was 5058 located in the ground/basement, every night when we come back to the room we can smell cigerette smoke. Tried calling to change room but there were no empty rooms available. I dont know whether it is from the air vent or the room beside us. There is a closed connecting door in the room. The ciggerete smoke was strong and disturbing.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
179,Average Hotel,30,August 2016,"It really is a 2.5 star hotel and that's being generous...we checked in after 9pm and there was only 1/4 roll of toilet paper left so we had to call room service for more..it's right next to a busy road so there is constant traffic. The pool is very small and the sun beds are right next to the pool which makes it feel like you could splash the people on the sun bed. And breakfast, warm milk for cereal and very limited selection mainly Indonesian food. Great if you don't want luxury.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
180,Sunset Stay,30,July 2016,restaurant food is very average although the Staff are very friendly.

You get what you pay for I guess.,Sense Sunset Seminyak
181,Excellent value for price,40,August 2016,"We got a free upgrade to a pool view room, which was lovely.

The staffs are so friendly and helpful, once I couldn't find the hairdryer in my room then I just called the staff and in minutes they sent it to my room right away.

Location is strategic enough, only 15 minutes from airport and walking distance to bars or coffee shop area in Seminyak.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
184,Great value for money,50,July 2016,"We stayed two night on weekend and our room was upgraded to deluxe with pool view and balcony. Staff was friendly and responsive. I checked in at midnight and found the the jet shower is jammed, called housekeeping and they fixed it immediately. The food was good. Walking distance to Seminyak area where all cute cafes are located. Very reasonable price.....",Sense Sunset Seminyak
185,Amazing!,40,July 2016,"We went from the airport to this hotel with the hotel's provided service which is a pick up at the airport for 175 000. The room is really clean, and so is the bathroom.

We got a free upgrade to a deluxe room with a balcony view (We can see the pool from above). The bed is neat and not dirty at all. The TV have indovision/international channels and the room is tidy.

Only warning is don't brew tea or anything sweet and just leave it on the table because there will be ants. They are pretty small but there's not a lot to be cautious about.

The bathroom have no bathtub and there's a glass wall that seperates the shower from the toilet and sink.

There is also a clothes hanger (about 5) and a place below it where you can tuck in your suitcase there. (2 can fit in)

And 2 night stands on each side of the bed. Each have a charger so you can leave your phone to charge there overnight if you want to.

The pool might look huge but it's not really as big as it looks on pictures. You can still swim though. And a part of the pool can be used by kids 'cos it's not that deep.

The food unfortunately is not the best. It is a mere ""okay"". Not too bad, not too good. Had breakfast two times at this hotel. Being a local myself, I've tasted better original Indonesian food than the ones they cook here. But if you're a foreigner, no doubt you can try these Indonesian food. I personally like their corn starch soup and soto.

Some of their elevator buttons doesn't respond when pressed. Have to press it multiple times.

Sense Seminyak have a backdoor pass. You can go to Bali Deli, Periplus bookstore, cafes, and other places. Quite near so I suggest walking to save money.

But the hotel has a back entrance that leads straight to Bali Deli and Jl. Seminyak. So great and close to shops, supermarket and restaurants. About 10000rp to get to eat street in Seminyak or you could walk. Rooms are very clean and bed very comfortable. The gym has a treadmill, bike, and cross trainer.

192,It Suited Our Need at Quite the Small Fee,20,April 2016,"We booked this hotel for the last few hours of our stay in Bali, just so we would have a place to shower, if necessary, or just chill for a bit before heading to the airport for a flight to our next destination. The hotel did serve as a place to be until our driver picked us up, but we did not shower (fortunately, we did not need to), and we did not stay in the room the whole time. If one just glossed over the bathroom, it may appear fine, but upon my husband's close examination, there was some cleaning and repair that needed to be done. Since we were there for only a few hours, we did not have to hang up clothes, but just so you know, there was no closet in the room. We did not try out the bed. As for the manner of at least one desk employee, it was cold, quite unlike our usual experience in Bali. The up side is that the location of the hotel is close to a number of restaurants (we went to one about three blocks away for dinner), and the room was just 25 US dollars.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
193,Nice and Affordable Hotel,40,April 2016,"I stay in here for 4D3N with my friend. Well we had free upgrade from Superior to Deluxe room. The room is quite spacious and clean. We have a large window, which is nice.

The breakfast is so-so. Well, you got what you paid. Price is quite cheap for a night so i dont expect anything for a breakfast.

Just an advice, maybe it would be good if the hotel prepare one staff to stand by at pool area. There's no one help for borrowing a towel or anything around the pool when i want to swim in there.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

The first rooms I tried were damp, but the front desk were kind enough to let me have a balcony room which had no issues. Everything worked as it should - clean pool with sun loungers, lots of TV channels, great aircon, reliable in-room wifi. The only small improvement would be that they use these odd short sheets on the bed so your legs & feet are in contact with the duvet inner - not very hygenic, and I've never encountered this at a hotel before. I ordered room service a few times, and the food arrived quickly & was very tasty. The location is not near the beach, but the Bali Deli & other restaurants are at the back entrance of the hotel & the hotel is on Sunset Road which gives you easy access to everywhere if you have your own transport.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Check in time was strict at 2pm, but when we checked in at 2.30ish our room was not ready so we were allocated to another room, which was heavily smelled out of cigarettes. After complained to the management, we got upgraded to Grand Deluxe, which was nothing grand about it.

I got there yesterday and after waiting for probably 20/30 minutes, filling all the forms and stuff I was told my room was under maintenance, and the hotel was fully booked; therefore they would have taken me to another hotel! Like, seriously?

Got my money back and ran away from it.

We were located on level 4 in the corner. The room was a decent size with 1 king bed (2 singles pushed together) I was travelling with a baby so we organised a crib which was a bonus as I didnt have to take mine.
The back entry into the hotel is handy however as its steps I couldn't use it too often with a stroller.
There are plenty of restaurants around and a 5 minutes stroll to the main street in Seminyak.
The pool is cold, however nice after a warm day.
Situated on a main road I couldn't hear any of the traffic however the other guests in the hotel were noisy in the corridors. The rooms were quiet so that was a bonus, the walls must have been pretty thick as no one could hear my crying baby.
Room service was good, House keeping good, reception staff lovely.
Don't think I would stay again as I Usually stay in South Kuta with the family however it was nice enough for the week.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Coz we didn't get any copies from booking.com, they insisted we have to pay cash at the counter otherwise they won't let us stay for the night evn it was very late at that nite n my son was sleepy. So we paid the cash there. When we got home from holiday, I checked my bank acc. They charged same amount from my bank acc. So we tried to call the hotel, try to find out what's going on there. But the staff there just simply hung up the phone. So they just charged us twice money and you can't find anybody to respond this. F n got rip of",Sense Sunset Seminyak
207,Dissapointed,20,February 2016,"We stayed here in room 5219 between the 12th and the 20th Feb 2016. Whilst the staff were friendly there are many things lacking to bring this hotel up to an acceptable standard.
1. No fridge in the room. This was pointed out to staff who just didn't seem to understand that its normal for most hotels to have a bar fridge.
2. Full of noisy guest from China that were rude and did not take the comfort of other guest into consideration. The pool was always over crowded and the were splashing and diving into the pool despite the sign warning them not to. The corridors and adjoining room was noisy with doors banging and talking with raised voices until the early hours of the morning. The guy in the adjoining room must have been shifting the furniture around with thumps and dragging noises about 3am. I had to bang on the wall to get him to be quiet.
3. Had breakfast in house on 3 occasions and the offering at the buffet was the same. Guest were smoking in the restaurant without any objection from staff.
4. The housekeeper never left sufficient tea, coffee and creamer in the rooms so we had to constantly call them to ask for more. The toilet paper must have been on ration as that too wasn't replenished.
5. The shower whilst good, was in need of repair as it squirted water onto the ceiling and into a air-conditioning duct.
I note that similar issues were raised in some of the reviews done by previous guests and the stock standard replies by management however nothing seems to have been done to address those issues.
This hotel is rated 112 out of 133 hotels in Seminyak and reading from other guests reviews and my own experience I can see why they are towards the bottom of the pile.
On a positive note we ordered a meal via room service and the pasta dish and tthe pizza was awesome.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
208,Great Deal,40,January 2016,"I was staying at this hotel for a quick transit before an office event in Bali. This hotel is located in Sunset Road, not so far from Seminyak area and located just right on the main street. So, i believe it won't be hard to find this place. You'll find lots of restaurants and stores just right behind the hotel.

The room was very nice, quite spacious, clean, and neat. Good job on making the room very nice and lovely. No complaints with the room. This room just met my expectation. However, since I got room with street view I found it very noisy during the morning since it is located right in front of main street. So, please consider to request room with better location.

It also has a nice swimming pool inside the hotel area. Too bad I didn't have any chance to swim. The service was nice, also no complaints with the service. Overall, this hotel was a great deal with affordable rate and great location. It was unfortunate that I had a limited time to stay here. This hotel will be on my list when I visit Bali next time.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
209,"Good Hotel-Great Location, Helpful Staff",40,January 2016,"My husband and I have recently returned from a 2 week holiday in Seminyak, Bali.
When we booked our trip it was a last minute decision. We had never been to Bali before and had very little knowledge on where to go, where to stay or what we could do.
We stayed over the Christmas and New Year period and during our stay we found the hotel to be in a great base location for the places that we would walk to, etc.
The hotel itself was constantly being cleaned by the designated cleaning staff. If we wanted anything, they were more than happy to help us. We opted to pay to have a buffet breakfast when booking the hotel and we couldn't have made a better decision. The convenience and variety saved us a lot of time and effort.
We found the staff and quality of the hotel made our trip that bit more enjoyable.
We were able to skype our family over Christmas, the internet connection was that good and the pool being so attractive, made it that bit nicer to have a lazy pool day every now and then.
The hotel was great value for money and will be booking again during our next visit.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

212,Worst hotel ever,10,January 2016,"I can honestly say that this was a truly terrible experience staying in this dump, completely over priced, the rooms are terrible the food is equally as bad and the swimming pool never sees any sun, we stayed here for 3 nights and couldn't wait to get out!! It's on very busy road with no proper footpaths and the footpaths have open manholes in them every 5 meters that if you feel down you would be very lucky to come out of!! DO NOT STAY HERE GUYS ITS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING!!!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
213,Excellent service,50,January 2016,"I bought a Sense hotel non exchangeable, non refundable voucher for my parents but mistakenly chosen Sense Sunset Seminyak instead of its sister, Sense Seminyak jalan Kayu Jati.
I called the hotel and the reservation girl, mbak Anggi, was really understanding and acommodative.
With her instructions I can get my voucher fully refunded back from the online travel agent.
Although I havent got any chance yet staying at the premises but I'm really satisfied with their service and wish that all hotels have the level of service as they were.
Terimakasih Sense Sunset!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
214,Friendly staff,40,November 2015,The hotel staff are so helpful while in queque check in.. We booked a deluxe room for 2 nights.. The room is quite cozy and clean for a 3 stars hotel.. The best experience is when i need to print some documents the staff let me printed for free of charge.. For me is quite ok and maybe need some improvement for the breakfast menu..,Sense Sunset Seminyak
215,Overall nice,40,December 2015,"it's on the main street of sunset road, near to wahaha pork ribs (before the resto), our room is superior, we got spacious room for the two of us, but since we got underground room, there was no view outside windows, but I guess if you want the view you can ask higher floor. Swimming pool is small but nice. Near to many food resto (using motor/car, only in minute you will find wahaha pork resto, warung sunset, japanese resto, etc). overall it's a nice hotel. Only they don't have free transfer to/from airport.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
216,Cockroaches everywhere!,20,January 2016,"Stayed there for 2 nights with my friend. First impression was that it's nice and clean enough,but then there I've seen so many cockroaches that I decided to check all my belongings to make sure I won't carry them home. That was pretty disgusting. The breakfast was so so if you'd like to have european food. In general I would say that 5the hotel is not too bad,but cockroaches...it's unacceptable.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
217,Not the best..,30,December 2015,"Stayed at swiss belinn seminyak/ sense sunset for 4 nights in December and wasn't overly impressed.
Have stayed many times at swiss belinn legian and have loved it - therefore chose to stay at this sister hotel for a cheap place to stay after 4 weeks travelling in indonesia.

I found the noise quite frustrating - was awoken each day at about 7am to children in the pool/ around the breakfast area and also late at night in the pool and lobby area. Had made a number of calls to reception at around 11pm when the noise still hadn't stopped and they didn't appear to be very bothered or attempt to quieten it at all..

The room was lovely though, all the facilities were of a pleasant standard; fresh towels, bed made daily, fresh water and bathroom amenities daily. Although there was no bar fridge in the room, which I found was quite odd for a modern hotel? There was also a lack of wardrobe/ clothes storage. As I was staying by myself it was manageable, however an extra person in the room would make things a tad difficult.

As my flight home was leaving at 11pm I had requested a late checkout of 6pm - I was told by reception that this was ok but I would be required to pay double the nightly rate that I had paid for the past 4 nights????

There were a number of times during my stay where my key would not let me enter my room.. So numerous trips to reception to recode the key to my room entailed.

Whilst the hotel facilities were adequate, clean and pleasant - I felt that this hotel was not quite suited for westerners and the hospitality of staff was not at the level I usually experience in Bali..

Would I stay here again? Possibly.. But not for longer than a night or two..",Sense Sunset Seminyak
218,Great location,30,December 2015,Stayed for 4 nights recently. The hotel is in a great location located right in front of Bali deli and numerous eateries and massage places. The hotel itself is catered to the Asian market and is very noisy and the pool gets no sun. The breakfast is average however does a nice omelette. Had room room service which included a beef rendang which was very tasty.,Sense Sunset Seminyak
219,Beware name change,30,December 2015,"Booked Swiss belinn but has changed name to sense sunset which confused our driver who picked us up from airport. Average hotel staff excellent & hotel very clean, room size ok, hotel ok if not spending much time there, pool & area very small in middle of hotel noise carries up to rooms, breakfast average caters more for Asian, roadworks on street out front which caused major traffic jams & long delays. Walking distance to shops & beach",Sense Sunset Seminyak
220,"Bad location, poor facilities",10,December 2015,"The hotel is located at Sunset Road, which is a highway that connected Kuta to Petitenget..
The facilities was very poor, they didn't have hair dryer at their room.
Breakfast was very standard, not like a 4 stars hotel.
Overall, it's not worthy with the price.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
221,"Clean, friendly staff but poor breakfast",30,December 2015,"My friend and I stayed here for only one night as a stop before we head to to Gili Islands the next day. The hotel is good and the staff are friendly except for two major issues:
1) The breakfast is very poor (No cheeses, no pancakes, no hams etc.)
2) It was very noisy in the morning. I woke up (7-8am) to noise coming from the lobby downstairs where people are having breakfast.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
222,nice place,30,December 2015,"the hotel was so cozy. The swimming pool is okay, the food is good... the room is average... all is ok. It was so okay for that price... Mie goreng and nasi goreng is so yummy there, the portion is enough for sharing... i will be back again.........",Sense Sunset Seminyak
223,Clean affordable room,40,December 2015,"We booked through Virgin travel, really good special and upgraded to family suite for min amount. The room was great, clean and modern. I think basic rooms would have been too small. The only disappointing thing was we requested 2 beds, but only got 1 King size. For 2 adults and 1 child too small. They keep on advising us as well we had to pay for child breakfast, although again we had Hotel voucher stating included in package. Once we told them 3 mornings in a row they stopped that, and we got really friendly staff ; Coorey was wonderful. We had to pay $20 AU extra per night for another bed which was disappointing as Hotel Voucher clearly stated 2 beds.. At present they are doing Road works in front so really hard to walk to what would normally be close shops etc. We used the back entrance which took us to streets that I was familiar with, and found places that I had previously visited. Other than the bed bungle , I thought it was fantastic value for money. The Breakfast was fantastic and the staff always friendly, room always cleaned.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
224,"Great pool, good location!",30,September 2015,"I was staying there on september. My friend told me, the hotel is very good and comfortable for budget hotel. So, i decided to choose this hotel.
Voila! It was a great! They're telling me the truth. So quite good enough for budget hotel. I got the smooking room and unfortunately, i dont have a balcony 😓 and the window can't to open, but overall, i recommended you to stay here!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
225,"location is good, room was great only poor service",30,December 2015,"when me and my friend check it staffs are very nice and helpful
(though there was mistake to charge us 2.800.000 instead of 2.080.000 he was confuse but my friend quickly notice it. Our room was not near the pool area so it was ok (facing pools might be noisy) room got cleaned everyday which is good, bed, showers are great (value for money) and we got our water bottle replaced everyday. The only poor thing is the service. ordered breakfast 110.000 the staff said ""I will give u everything"" ok so we dont need to choose the bread/juice and others but what came is very worst! so do NOT order any room service. no hash brown and staff did not even tell us. I need to make call again and she offer to send croissant (croissant was suppose to be there with toast bread) so many things not included very bad room service. mini bar only oreo and pop mie nearly expired in a month. better buy your own at mini market around.

only good for stay, type of guest who just need good sleep and good location. we left hotel morning 10am everyday and back around 9pm so this was a good choice and deal. sunset road is close to center of seminyak where all the cafes.restaurants/bar/shopping places. not a place for leisure if u are looking for pool, great view or things like that this is not for u.(walk distance to made's warung. we had local food on our first night in bali just walk from back door of hotel very convenience)

overall this place good for people who dont spend much time in hotel
just need Clean, good room, beds, showers, safe stay and comfortable.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
226,Very disappointed,20,December 2015,"We moved from same chain hotel in Legian to this one in Seminyak! Bad choice!
First room we were allocated - brick wall for a view and no bar fridge
Paid for and upgrade ($20 au per night)
Balcony looks over the pool - but there's no furniture on the balcony (?) not allowed to take the 1 foot stool onto the balcony so there is no where to sit.
No top sheet on the beds
The shower flooded the bathroom every used
No fridge - we asked for one and got it delivered - didn't work!
The room air conditioning was not adequate - even leaving it on whilst out - the housekeepers would turn it up whilst we were out so that it was unbearable when we returned.
Only 1 English speaking TV channel and no DVD player (not even avail to rent!)
The ""mini bar"" consisted of a broken packet of Oreos and a bowl of 2 minute noodles - yes this was checked to ensure we didn't take it upon our departure
Noisy by the pool but the worst was the housekeeping staff pushing trollers (sounded like cargo trains) down the hallway late at night
8 really uncomfortable pool beds to cover the entire resort!
We only had 1 breakfast - $5 paid extra for cappuccino. The bacon was like fritz and the ""soft poached eggs"" were like rubber . The cappuccino was normal Bali coffee with extra milk - no froth! If you are unlucky enough to choose here - the Bali Deli across the road does a beautiful breakfast for a couple of dollars more!
I understand this hotel is changing from Swiss belinn this month - understandable, so not the level of service you get from Swiss Bel hotels.
Upon check in it was confirmed that my payment through booking.com had been received - however we were required to pay 100000 Rp cash ad deposit
At checkout I was informed that they got it wrong and I had to pay as payment hadn't been received from the booking website
Not a pleasant experience",Sense Sunset Seminyak
227,Nice hotel good for a quiet holiday,30,December 2015,"Lovely hotel, staff friendly, tasty breakfast that we had included. Pool area was great, was very quiet while we were here, had pool to ourselves sometimes, food at restaurant good and very good prices. Cheap bintangs which is always great! Was a little bit of a walk from the beach though, maybe 20 mins to beach or 25mins to middle of seminyak. Enjoyed our stay though!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
228,Average hotel,30,November 2015,"Last month we had a wonderfull off-season holiday in Bali and stayed in the Swiss-Bell Seminyak. We bought a package deal, including flight, hotel and breakfast for quite a cheap price, so we didn't expect too much. Service is very good and the room service is all right. The hotel is located on the Sunset Road, a very busy street and one lane was closed during our holiday, resulting in every day traffic jam when we wanted to go to Kuta or Seminyak. Off course this has nothing to do with the hotel and the service they provided (the whole island is teased by traffic jam), but it is worth considering.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
229,"Room ok, service No!",30,December 2015,"I stayed here with family on Dec 5 for 1 day. First, we checked in at arround 2.30pm. Receptionist didn't mention to us which floor is our rooms. We have to go to 5th floor because we think our room are in 5th floor (we booked for 3 rooms). I really have no idea, that all room start with number 5. Receptionist just left even iam not done talk to them. I dont know maybe because we're local, they dont serve us well.
And in the afternoon, when we go to the pool, we order pizza, but they served our pizza without the cutteleries.
In the next day, when we go to the pool in the morning staff not smile or even say for a greeting.

Overall, staff need to pay attention on small things like this because in the hospitality industry, this is what people gonna miss from your hotel.

Point plus is ::
Room is clean and comfortable.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
230,SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE -- Good Value but BAD Smoking smell,30,November 2015,"Smell of cigarette smoke was everywhere. Even inside our room we can smell and feel the smoke. Guest allowed to smoke in the lobby & swimming pool.
Breakfast was very nice and delicious…
Room & Bathroom was okay but in my room they only supplied with 2 towel.

232,Good value,30,November 2015,"The staff at the reception is relatively friendly. Just on the request for another room after we got the uncomfortable room might have been a bit more friendly.
The order of a second toothbrush set was immediately done. The question is more ... why haven't been two toothbrush sets in the room... anyway.
The value to jump in and get a quick room to sleep is good.
The rooms are all situated to the inside so there is no noise from the street.
The rooms are clean and functional.
Check out was quite good and quick.

The pool area is absolutely lovely, and the rooms are pretty spacious and they are clean and nice. It is located just a short walk away from the bars and restaurants in Seminyak, and the beach is also pretty close. A lot of supermarkets around.
The only minus was the bad wifi connection. Maybe better on lower floors, we stayed at the fifth floor, and it was not very good up there.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Breakfast with Indonesian menu, combined with a western menu is served adjacent to the swimming pool located on the ground floor. In addition, they also cooperate with the rent car and bike, so we can easily rent a vehicle to get around in Bali.

Service from a friendly hotel, full facilities and also affordable price, so we recommend to stay here.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Cool pool, 20 minutes walk to Seminyak beach, don't change any money there as there rates are really bad and not negotiable. Decent size room, bad sheets and pillow covers ( clean but bad quality).

238,Not too shabby,30,October 2015,"We stayed for 4 nights during our last visit. Pros: our room got upgraded to another one with better view (pool view).
Cons: amenities less complete; we had to reconfirm some of the stuff to the operator but the operator said ""maaf untuk tumblrnya memang terbatas jadi tidak di set up"",that was a ridiculous answer.

250,It was a very good stay! Satisfied guests here.,40,September 2015,"The staff was so accommodating when we arrived earlier than the said check in time. We had to wait for some time but still they made a way to prepare our room earlier. It's best to get the room behind the room fronting the pool.

The room was very clean. Sheets were well washed and even the towels. There's a complimentary water bottle and it's good that they do provide a water boiler to make some tea/coffee. The size of the standard room was a bit small but is still good since the price is quite cheap. Just that the rooms are not that sound proof but anyway we still managed to have a good sleep after a tiring day at the beach and after all the tours we did.

Location wise, I can say that it's the best! Very safe to walk around and there's a lot of spas, restaurants, local shops and art galleries behind the hotel area. We enjoyed renting a motorcycle to better access some areas that are quite far.

This hotel is okey. But there are more and better hotels that can provide that extra with the same price.

I love to walk in the morning so for me it's ideal to walk 30 minutes to the beach and local street 10 minutes.

Nice big room and clean, even thought of water and brushing kit.

Breakfast Has a lot of choice.

-
Down side the rooms are not very sound proof from the hall and swimming pool.
I would recommend a room NOT with a balkon on the pool side way to noisy. I'm sleeping with ear plugs just to have a non break sleep.

Swimming pool is not huge with 4 strokes your at the end of the pool.

Gym isn't much eather. Just 3 cardio machines which u would recommend to do at the beach.

There are no furniture on the balcony. We hang a pair of shorts on the handle of the open balcony door, inbetween 10 minutes a member of the staff called and advised us that it was not allowed to have anything out on the balcony. He called and someone went to every single room and told each guests to take in everything from the balcony, also the small chair people took from their room to sit on.

They also provides a nice decoration for honeynooner, the twin towels decorated to be the sweetest swans with flowers. I believe the management has powerfull plan and commitment providing all their best for the customers. It is not just because they are using a global brand, but more to their personal and professional efforts to engage their customers with excellent service. Clean room, honest room size, balcony, ac working well, warm water working well, courteous staff, humble food price, friendly room rates, all completed in one purpose of every customers need.

258,Arrogant Staff,10,August 2015,"Checked in on August 21st only stayed for one night we booked three room. In term of room cleanliness food and facility quite okay for 3 star Hotel and affordable price. What makes me rated this hotel ""terrible"" is one of the staff behaviour. When we check in at front desk (at 2pm), receptionist inform us that the room still not ready due to housekeeping still make up the room then we asked how long to prepared it (we asked this several times), finally the receptionist told us will be ready in 1,5 Hours, we're shocked it took a very long time which we will checked in at 3:30 PM, the receptionist told us to wait and ask for our understanding since that a lot of guest in group are checking out, few minutes later a staff came to front desk, if i'm not mistaken written on name tag his name is Dharma Susila. He then help receptionist explain to us, but again the solution only : ask our understanding to wait the room to be ready, I am arguing with him Hotel need to be professional that by 2 PM (based on hotel SOP) guest have right to checked in on time. Funny thing is Pak dharma replied ""there is no Hotel can guarantee guest will check in on time"" how can three star Hotel and International chain made this statement? And arrogantly with high tone arguing with Hotel guest. After 10 minutes arguing and I also asked solution finally we took any room that already prepared. Sadly after the argument Pak Dharma and receptionist not single of them Apologizing to us. My question to Swiss bellin management ,is this the SOP for handling objection if room not ready even on check in time? No solution or compensation, only argue with guest to patiently wait the room to be ready.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

260,Great 3.5*** accommodation,40,August 2015,"For 3.5 stars accommodation this is a great hotel for budget travelers. However if you want beach view or resort style accommodation this is not the one.
A compliment to some of their staffs who were very helpful even on situation when I wasn't expect it. One morning I was wandering around the main breakfast table which full with Asian breakfast and don't know what to eat (I don't eat Asian breakfast) aside the sunny side-ups I have on my hand. Then a man which I assumed is the manager or supervisor offered me if I need anything he can get it for me. I said I was looking for bacon or sausages to have with my fried eggs, and then he go and get it for me.
Other time I was standing off the main street waiting for taxi, and a female security officer (Paulina, if I got her name right) was walking pass me after she put offerings inside their little counter at the gate, she then asked me if I was waiting for taxi, when I said yes she then offered me to have a sit in the lobby and she will wait for the taxi for me.
I have dramas with staff drinking the mineral water in the room (mini bar) and put the sticker back, a quick response by staffs but after sending someone to the room to check the bottle- I hear nothing back, even though when I check-out they didn't charge me for that.

I arrived on an early flight, and the reception staff sent the cleaners to turn over my room so i could check in early. they offer Free wifi, Room service was ok. it was fairly quiet when we were there, so no noise from neighbours.. I would recommend for business travellers or people transitioning to or from the airport.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

266,"Cheap, but not so cheerful",20,July 2015,"I stayed at the Swiss-Belinn for a total of 3 nights during July, with 3 other friends. Upon arriving at 2.30pm, I was informed that my room was not yet ready and thus I had to sit and wait at reception for 15 minutes while it was prepared. Not a great start, as everyone knows the first thing you wanna do when you get off a flight and arrive somewhere is get to your room and get sorted. In terms of location, this hotel is in a very good area. It is within 15 minutes of all the main attractions in Seminyak, namely the beach, so walking isn't exactly a chore and taxis are relatively cheap if preferred. Our room was situated on the ground floor. Having read previous reports concerning this hotel, I can now confirm that the walls are paper thin. Clearly there was no acoustic concept factored into the design and construction of this building and no doubt the developer has skimped on construction materials, because we could hear everything that was going outside our room. The room next to us continued to leave their door open which brought about a relentless beeping from the smart-lock system and disrupted the little sleep we were able to get. Upon requesting an iron, I fell ill to an hour-long ordeal which involved me initially having to ring housekeeping myself, then to be told the iron was out of stock even after I'd been told that an iron would be brought to me. My roommate then asked at reception, and was asked if he'd checked other rooms yet. Ok, so we simply go around knocking door to door in the hope of finding an iron? Incredible. Eventually it came, after much waiting and hassle. My friends in their room also told of a lingering cigarette smell and a few cockroaches which sounds even more unpleasant.To be honest, this hotel was a cheap stay and I guess you get what you pay for. The staff aren't well-versed enough in the concept of service and there is a serious lack of communication and understanding. Thankfully I was only on a short trip to Bali, otherwise my stay would have become even more tedious. I'm sure there are better options available in Bali.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
267,Pleasant stay,40,July 2015,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for the first time, for 3 nights. We found the location pretty nice, it was really close by the airport, and kind of like the central at the city so it wasn't really far from any destination we wanted to go. The staffs are friendly and nice, the room was neat and clean, nothing to complain on.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
268,good value,40,July 2015,"i stayed at this hotel last week, after reading the review, i ask the front desk to give me the room that is not in the same floor with the group that will come latter, they give me a room at the corner,at the back site of the hotel.The lady who from the front desk is really helpfull and actually listen to my request.. the room is small,the bed is small to but clean enough.the distance from the mattras to the small table beside the bed is to far, i think they make a mistake when they design it.the bed is good, and i have a good sleep.

269,"Location, location, location",40,July 2015,"We've stayed from July 8th through July 14th, right from the start their services were very prompt. We got upgraded to deluxe room on 5th floor with balcony and pool view, there's a bit of air conditioning problem but as soon as we inform the technician and one of the manager we met in the elevator the problem was solved in no time and we got a very ultra chill room after.
One thing we'd like to point out is that the location of the hotel is more superior and cleaner compared to the same hotel located in Sunset Road.
If you like the Seminyak, Petitenget, Kerobokan area and want to find a good place to sleep after all those activities you did since the morning and still want a budget friendly place then this hotel is the spot to be.
Good Job guys, we have a pleasant stay during our trip.
The only downside was the noise from the hallway got through inside the room, maybe you should invest more to make them more soundproofed.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
270,Value for money,40,July 2015,"Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and experienced excellent service throughout. Staff were thoughtful and put in effort to serve. I was given a surprise free upgrade to a deluxe room for all my 4 nights, and it was really convenient to have the room right beside the pool. Location was easily accessible to the popular areas of Seminyak and Kuta. Otherwise, taking a cab from the hotel to these area is also a cheap alternative due to the proximity. Room was really clean and complimentary water is replaced daily during room service - That's definitely a bonus point. Highly recommended!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
271,Great Place To Stay in Seminyak,50,July 2015,"Really nice place to stay for a budget hotel!

Great location by Bali deli, street shopping, night life etc.

We are traveling around Bali for the best budget places and this place is 1 of the nicest for the price.

272,Rubbish,10,July 2015,"Without wishing to sound racist, there are certain standards of behaviour that are anticipated by certain cultures. The type of clientelle who frequent this hotel, think it is ok to be loud and noisy in rooms, especially outside corridors at times when you're trying to sleep i,e 10pm at night and 7pm in the morning. They converse loudly, let their children yell and play in the corridors and think its fine. I'm from a place where we have more respect for people's peace & quiet. If you're in the latter bracket I would recommend you go somewhere else.

Other points, I booked one night because I had currency, I asked if it was ok to pay in cash for the remaining nights I wanted to stay and was told no it wasn't I had to go through the booking site. This caused me great inconvenience. I did indeed book the next booking throught the website. The confirmation was not sent through immediately, I showed the staff that I had paid, but they hassled me twice until I got the confirmation through. I explained that I had not received it yet and they did not take me seriously, kept pursuiing me, eventually I rang the company, so I spent most of the second day messing around trying to get re-booked in. I put some complaints to the manager of the hotel on the first day, no reply. He seems to be very active on Trip Advisor but nowhere to be seen when it comes to the hotel.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

276,Great value for money,40,July 2015,"We stayed here 10 days during our visit to Bali . The staff were amazing, we definitely made relationships with them. We had a poolside room and the room is very well appointed
This isn't the greatest place if you want to spend all day at the pool sunbathing as it's mostly shaded but if you are a little adventurous and want to spend most of your time out exploring its a great safe haven to return to each night
The buffet breakfast is fantastic.

Great value for money and we love the towell sculptures",Sense Sunset Seminyak
277,"Decent stay, good location, reasonably priced but be cautious",30,June 2015,"Easy accessibility to some hotspots in seminyak, friendly and helpful staff. They even printed a map for us to get around. Rooms are quite small for a family, not too spacious but adequate for couples. No view from the room, we had frosted glass windows. Poor sound proofing, can be quite noisy with people talking outside the room, doors slamming, etc. Bring ear plugs. Room amenities was good, with safety deposit boxes, 2x free daily water bottles (small bottle only), etc. Pool is small but clean esp for a hot afternoon dip, but not for proper swimming. Now the negative: one day after coming back to the room, we noticed an additional large bottled water on our mini-bar which was already opened with over 3 quarters of water in it. Each room is provided with 2 x large 1.5l which is payable if consumed, so we informed the reception about this extra bottle that 'magically' appeared. We didn't take any thing from the mini-bar as we normally purchase our water from a nearby 24/7 mini mart, so the water bottle was probably left by the cleaning staff? Room service guy came, apologized and collected it. During check-out however, they said we opened the bottle and wanted to charged us for it. We argued and explained that we informed the reception before about this and they have collected the mystery bottled water. I even took a photo of the extra bottle in case they asked for proof, so in the end they just 'waived' it off. We are not stingy tourists and we don't mind paying for a bottled water (that cost almost next to nothing in Bali) but only if we actually opened and drank it. But to accuse hotel guests of doing something they didn't, that's just not right. *management please take note. Overall our stay was Ok, but that bottled water incident was quite dubious and left us wondering if it's a common hotel scam or just an honest miscommunication. Just to share, a similar incident happen to me in bangkok, where a hotel charged me $15 for a broken glass tumbler which i didn't even use, so i'm quite cautious about hotels nowadays.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

282,All most got killed in that Hotel,10,May 2015,"A hotel that represents an international chain but with MOTEL services.

The hotel fails in providing the basic needs for a traveller to a world destination. The rooms are small and no sound proof, so even the next door room's noise can be heard. Also, the hotel that is located near the beach, has no proper hanger to dry clothes!

Additional ""lovely"" experiences in this hotel:

1- The first hotel that I am asked at the time of Check-in to forward them the booking confirmation letter via e-mail.

2-The first hotel that ask me to pay IDR 50.000 just because I lost my room key.

3- The hotel has no idea what ""Lost and Breackage Budgetting"" means. They ask me to pay for a tumbler glass that was accidently broken in my room.

4-The hotel offer a motorcycle to rent at a price. Then when the actuall booking happen. I was being charge more (almost double of the first price), like if I were renting it on the streets. Even worse, the registration paper of the motorcicle rented has been expired, which almost make me have problems with the local police.

5- While waittimg for our flight the hotel restaurant at lunch time got full of TOXIC smoke. Non of the staff care nor react. After almost getting KILLED AND intoxicates due to the smoke I was approach only to give me the bill.

I asked for the GM and of course as expected the ""manager"" was off amd no person in charge capable to give me a reasonable explanation or at least an apology.

Overall, good luck staying with Swiss Bell Hotels and Resorts. Far from being a 4 star. A 1 * motel

If you looking for a place for your chill, your family you might get Kill. Then this is the place to stay

295,Shocking booking system and inconstant service,30,January 2015,"Rooms in this fairly new hotel are reasonable and clean.The hotel is very well located and is very popular with very large groups of Chinese tourists However their booking system is terrible. I booked online on the hotels website. I thought that I was booking directly with the hotel and the email I received said that I had paid when I booked. However when I checked in this was not the case and there was a huge scene at reception. I was also told that I would not be getting the same rate as was quoted. In the end it was sorted out but it was not what I needed after a a long flight and battling through the airport. The front office manager M Hafizh Rahman was very helpful and is on the ball and aware of the inconstancy of service by some of the staff.
Internet is not good as it drops out all the time.During my stay the air-conditioning in my room died at midnight so I had to change rooms at 1am.

296,absolutely amazing,50,January 2015,"booked in for a period of 11 nights and my first impression was the professionalism of the hotel staff and overall cleanliness of the hotel and the surroundings.
Prompt service and the neat open spaces esp the pool area which I have to say its the centrepiece of the hotel ,looks like a welcome to the tropics.
its a beautiful experience even when at 7ish am one gets woken up by the conglomerate of Asian tourists rushing to the breakfast lobby and the bus transfers for the days outings .
its all part of the bali buzz,so enjoy it and don't expect a grave yard silence ,it is after all a reminder that life is a buzz that keeps exploring life ,day in and out.
it is very close to the shops and the seminyak night life but the plus is the quiet atmosphere at night even though the center is only a 5 min walk .
The restaurant is a bonus to the hotel having 2 cuisine to cater for the more adventurous, Indonesian and the western steak and chips .excellent choice for all.
the wifi is also worth mentioning ,overall good although I had the occasional drop line due to excessive users which is normal but that happened only at the beginning of my stay.

The only issue I experienced was the early morning noise of people closing their hotel room doors or kids in the pool at 7am. My suite faced the pool area and it was the only negative I can think of.

We arrived at reception after leaving the accomodation we had previously booked to stay in. Staff were lovely and showed us through a number of rooms making selection easy. Staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast buffet was always a treat. Weoften had the pool to ourselves or to share with just one or two other couples. We did experience some noise as our room was close to the foyer but after mentioning this to staff we were immediately given another room farther from the noise. THere were some rude and rowdy guests (which suprised me) but staff dealt with them promptly when it was brought to their attention. Only warning I will give is be sure you know when they are fogging !!! As with all resorts in Bali there is regular mosquito control and I experienced my first asthma attack here and felt I would die !! Hotel had no ventolin !!

305,Ideal hotel with a great design of entrance,40,May 2014,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights along with 50 students and 5 teachers during our school trip last May. We arrived Bali in the morning and our suitcases were brought to the hotel first because we had some places to visit before checking in. When we arrived the hotel late evening the suitcases were in the lobby. It's a bit chaotic when we checked in since some female students asked for room change because the room given had the big window with thin curtain so that people outside could see the room clearly. Fortunately, the front desk was cooperative in handling the check in, so check in was quite smooth although it's longer in my opinion.
The breakfast was great, the students loved the egg station so much. The room was clean and comfortable too. But at night we were a bit disturbed with the noise of a group of foreigner students who had school trip like us, they were shouting and laughing so loud in the corridor at the middle of night... we could here them clearly. I'm not saying that my students were not noisy at all, of course they chatted n giggled also, you know kiddos.. well the students being noisy was out of the hotel's control, but I think that the rooms need better sound proof.. we wouldn't listen the next room guests laughing if the room had better sound proof..
The other thing that the hotel should improve was that the front desk had to tell the guests about the charge of slippers. Some of my students didn't know that the hotel charged for the slippers, so they wore the slippers thinking that they were free of charge like in the other hotel.
Well that's not a big deal though, the students were happy and satisfied with the breakfast and they loved the hotel design especially the entrance and the luxurious car in front of the hotel. They took a lot of selfies there, lol...",Sense Sunset Seminyak

312,"Good Meeting Hotel, Far from attraction",30,October 2014,"I stayed 1 week (12 - 18 Oct) for company meeting,
Meeting hall is good with ever ready staff and the coffe break snack is also good.
Pool is too small and located near breakfast/restaurant so it's awkward to swim while everybody is eating and may get splashed.
Stayed at 5008, Room adequate but not spacious, clean and bathroom also clean with good strong shower. Bed is comfy and room amenities quite complete
Lunch and dinner is tasty and very good, but breakfast is bad (some of dinner leftover being modified for breakfast).
The best thing is WIFI is strong throughout the hotel and use the same channel all around.
Location is far from main attraction, Fitness room only had 3 equipment and cramped.
they had a back door leading to bali deli.
as i had the ground room it is very loud when the chinese group take their breakfast.
Good for meeting but for vacation maybe not so much",Sense Sunset Seminyak
313,"Affordable, Perfect for Bussines Trip",40,September 2014,"I stayed in Swiss-Belinn Seminyak at first because it was near to my project, I just simply need a clean spot to sleep. And turned out to be quite nice experience and I continue to stayed here several times, everytime I have bussines in Bali. The room very clean and big, the bed is big and comfortable, the bathroom also clean. They also give you breakfast, not too fancy but yet ok. I was impressed because the rate of the room is affordable and what we get is worth every money.
On my last stay, I tried to use their gym, but it was not enjoyable because the gym room is very small.

I will highly recommend Swiss-Beliin for its price, room, and location.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
314,Nice hotel,40,October 2014,"Very Clean. Bathroom excellent.

Not near the beach so if you willing to ride a scooter in the crazy traffic, or take a hired driver with car... Perfect.

Food very good and well priced..

Staff extremely good and friendly.

Room perfect for sleeping and even a lazy day at the hotel is fine as they have a very clean pool and a spa in-house with very good rates.

No fridge in rooms.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
315,find a budget hotel elsewhere,10,September 2014,"First of all, the room is noisy. its seems that most of the rooms are facing public area, and the insulation is bad. at night, there is a lot of chinese tourist that hang out either in the restaurant or the lobby, smoking and chatting. Not blaming them at all, but the room insulation is so bad, i can hear them till late pass 12.
what make it even worst is, the supposedly ""private"" patio in front of the room, they made it into a breakfast area in the morning. So its like trying to get some sleep in the middle of a restaurant.
So definitely avoid the room with the patio facing the pool, which is supposedly their more expensive ones.
And you can even hear the telephone ringing in the lobby or the massage extension. So imagine someone is trying to contact massage extension, at 10pm, nobody answering and they keep on ringing over and over again . Which happens that night. And no staff from the restaurant (which just across) have the initiative to pick up the phone.

Secondly the aircond is terrible. Don't get me wrong, the AC is cold. But after 5 hours of turning it on. So you'll sleep sweating and you woke up too cold.

Thirdly, the key card. They asked for a deposit in order for the guest to give them back when they checkout. I have no problem with this. Its just that, they use the keycard over and over again, so the keycard actually dirty. Its too dirty even to put in your wallet yet alone your pocket.

The breakfast is included with the room charge. Not much variety. The food drenched with oil. But this is not much of a problem. If you hungry. AND if you can get a table for breakfast.

The only plus point of this hotel is the new building. But there is a lot of new hotel opens up in bali. So i suggest find another one",Sense Sunset Seminyak

Upon arrival at the hotel, I requested a refund for the night we didn't stay, and was told that as it was booked through Expedia, I would have to go through them when I got home.The day I arrived home, I called Expedia, who contacted the hotel. The hotel told them they would not be issuing a refund as we did not bring up the issue whilst in Bali.This is precisely the opposite of what I was told in Bali.

I have never had a hotel treat their customers with such disgusting disrespect and blatant lies.

328,"Modern, Clean Hotel",30,July 2014,"Stayed at this hotel for 8 nights, modern, clean hotel, very friendly staff, overall good value for the money. Beds were good, room was clean and well serviced daily. First hotel I've stayed in that doesn't have a fridge standard, asked about this and they had one delivered. Breakfast was poor compared to all others I've had in Bali, very Asian style, limited choice, no bacon, everything was cold. The hotel is badly designed with the rooms looking into the centre with the pool in the middle also, any sound just echos, it can be very noisy, especially when breakfast starts at 6.30am, this is a wake up call every morning with tables being moved and set up and one morning the Bali Music was being played very loud waking the hotel quests. The pool gets very little sun so can be coolish, for such a large hotel there is a total of 8 (not a typo) sun lounges around the pool!!!
Overall good value for money, ideal for a night or two, not for a longer stay.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
329,First time traveler here,40,July 2014,"Ok, this is a pretty standard hotel. It is clean, comfortable and because I was traveling alone (not with some huge tour group) I felt like the staff treated me really well. Everyone addressed me by name within a couple of days and were always gracious to me.

Would I stay again? Well, no...but not because of anything bad in the hotel, its just Sunset Rd was inconvenient for the things I like to do in Bali. For someone traveling their first time to Bali and if you like to stay in a certain comfort zone, then you will not be disappointed staying here.

I hired a driver a few times to take me out to activities because i did not know any better. The driver was cool and gracious but he mostly took me to places that had 10000 chinese tourists...cool for some, but not the kind of experience I wanted.

I ate in the restaurant once and the food was palatable. I ordered pizza from room service and it was pretty horrible.

Anyway, I enjoyed my stay in Bali and I felt very comfortable at this hotel. I have nothing negative to say.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
330,Decent value - terrible location,30,July 2014,"I expected more from this hotel when I booked it. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the wifi was the best that I have experienced in three months in SE Asia which is why I am giving it there stars. That is where the good ends though.

If you want to go to the beach for surfing or sunsets or simply lounging in the sun or be anywhere near the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, you will need to walk about 20-30 min or take a motobike. I found this to be very activity prohibitive but I spent most of my time scuba diving elsewhere. (see my review for Adventure Scuba Diving Seminyak)

Don't prepay for your room to include the breakfast buffet. It's terrible. There are a lot of choices but most, if not all of the hot options are cold when they come out of the kitchen. Opt to explore elsewhere and you'll probably save some Rupiah at the same time.

When I first arrived, I asked for tour info. The tour desk had no idea how to help me and in fact spoke next to no English which surprised me since so many visitors to Bali are from Australia.

Given the other options for accommodation near by, I would likely not stay here again.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
331,"Great staff, clean rooms and good location",40,July 2014,"I really liked this hotel. Most importantly, it was clean, had hot water and AC! All this for a great price!
The only issue I had is that I ordered a vegetarian meal (it was marked as vegetarian), but they brought me shrimp chips with it. Now, luckily I know that these specific chips are made with/from shrimp so I had the sense to ask, but other people might not know. This was mostly unsettling because my friend, who I'm traveling with, is allergic to shrimp. This isn't a mistake any restaurants should ever make! And the only reason I bring this up here is that hopefully the hotel staff sees this and realizes what vegetarian truly means (this includes broth and seafood paste too).
If you don't have any allergies, then you'll be even happier with this place than I am.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

I was using web booking to swiss-belhotel website and booked a superior room which is located on Ground floor (one level below Lobby floor)...on the same floor with the swimming pool and restaurant. On 2nd night, we got our room upgraded to a Deluxe room with balcony of swimming pool view :)

The room is clean and even though the design is minimalist, it has quite complete amenities including a hair dryer in the bathroom.

Free in room WiFi was good. Its location on sunset road hence less traffic, a step away to Seminyak area (they have back door access to Bali Deli... Also, walking distance to Warung Italia, Bale Bali & shopping area in Seminyak).

We did not book a room which include breakfast, but we had an afternoon snack on the pool side... We ordered fried banana & French fries... The foods were good.

We stayed the first night there and were told they would move us to our balcony room the following day. In the morning we left our bags at the office and were told we couldn't check in until 2pm. I wasn't impressed with this as it was an error on their behalf but there wasn't much we could do about it. The balcony is small and doesn't have chairs. Pool doesn't get much sun. The hotel is really close to shops and restaurants. We walked everywhere. Beach is about a 20 minute walk. Some staff were good and others had no idea. Rooms were clean. It can get very noisy.

First time no one came up. Second time they did. The other day we nearly ran out of toilet paper again.( Three of us staying together and it seems housekeeper wouldn't leave an extra roll of paper) the other day we tried to call again at night.

The infinity pool and bar on the 6th floor has fabulous views over rooftops to the ocean which is only a few hundred mtres away. . There is really good bars, shopping and restaurants around this hotel. The wifi reception was good and there was a DVD player in the room. I loved the large shower in the rooms. The decor in the rooms was lively.The staff were all very helpful and willing to learn.
Now for the grizzlies which are minor. The air con is a bit noisy. Our room was under the pool so the noise of back washing at about 5 am was a bit annoying. I heard some people complaining about the rooms being to small. Breakfast was good. Bacon is not displayed in respect to Muslims.

338,high rise hell,10,May 2014,"This isn’t the type of hotel for an extended stay, over night or a day but that's about it, I stayed two weeks, even before check-in the problems started, email communication was impossible prior to my arrival, I’ve been home for three weeks and still haven’t had my emails answered, communication in general was very difficult. The first thing that bothered me was NO FRIDGE in the room, it was a very noisy hotel, large group bookings of inconsiderate people. The most horrendous nights were when a group of teenagers stayed from Fairview International College, there supervisors allowed them to run feral all over the hotel, it was like the place was under siege. With the amount of large groups staying breakfast became feeding time at the zoo, being a westerner I asked if I could have a western breakfast, yes I was told, it was the most frustrating experience trying to communicate what I would like to have, I chose items from the in room menu only to be told everything I asked for the kitchen didn’t have, I did however receive a large helping of attitude from the cooking staff if I asked for more bread or something simple like that. The mixed fruit juice on offer was nothing more than the fruit that was left over from the previous days breakfast, after being unrefrigerated for many hours, throw into a blender and called juice. Thank heavens the Bali Deli is just behind the hotel and I was able to get breakfast and coffee there even though I had paid extra for breakfast at the hotel. On two days there were major problems with the plumbing in my room, the toilet didn’t work, low water pressure and the water smelled foul, the maintenance people came to my room twice but couldn’t fix the fault. I had some laundry done only to find my favourite pair of Zara Man lounging pants didn’t come back. One afternoon after a day of shopping I thought I would try a cocktail in the bar at happy hour, I asked for a vodka martini and was met with blank looks, I suggested the staff Google the cocktail which they did but unfortunately they were unable to make it, I think what I received was just pure vodka with a slice of lime, when paying the bill I was charged full price not the half price as advertised on a black board. I used the phone in my room a few times to book spa treatments in the area,as the hotel spa was a joke, only two calls connected as the other times the line was engaged, I was charged for every time I made an unsuccessful unconnected call. It’s a pity this hotel was so awful, I booked it because it was affiliated with the Sense Hotel in Seminyak where I had stayed for Christmas and New Year, big mistake, the two properties may be affiliated but that's were the similarities end, Sense in Seminyak was far better.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

340,So much noise from the hallways!,20,May 2014,"We had made a reservation from 1/5 to 20/5 from a recommendation from a friend. We got in after 12 am on the 2nd from our late flight. We we're put on the floor of the lobby. At 6 am there was so much noise from being so close to the restaurant and they were setting up for breakfast. I can't wear earplugs and I was so not impressed. We also did not have a fridge in the room. I have stayed in several places in Bali and everyone of them have had a fridge!

We complained the next morning about the noise and no fridge. They moved us later that day into the third floor. We also got a room with a fridge.

But that wasn't the end of the noise. In the first week we were there they had several school children come and stay. They yelled at each other in the hallways as well as playing with a basketball at night. This was after 10 pm. It got bad that we rang the desk to get them up there to tell them to have some respect. If the rooms were more sound proof at the front doors we wouldn't have heard them.

The wifi was crap. It would take forever to log on then drop out. We tried at all hours of the day, 8am, 11am, 3pm and even at 10 and 11pm and it still dropped out. Easier going next door to the Bali Deli which has a small restaurant attached and getting a coffee and using their wifi.. Or walking to the end of Kunti street to Buzz cafe. The drinks were good and wifi excellent.

The staff were good at Swiss BelInn and the prices of massages reasonable. Not as cheap as on the street but not as expensive as most hotel massages. The pool does not look inviting at all. It is too close to the lower rooms

The breakfast was always cold! It was indonesian food but always cold. You could get fresh eggs cooked but. It was suppose to be a continentiL breakfast, but it was rice, noodles and other dishes. I wouldn't pay the extra to get the breakfast and just go to a cafe around the corner for breakfast. The footpaths out the front of hotel was pretty bad. Out the back way much better.

342,"Good People, Good Location, Clean Rooms, and Good Rates :)",40,May 2014,"We arrived on the 13th of May which is a Tuesday, and most unfortunately they didn't have a room for us as according to the front desk manager the a section of the air-conditioned system broke down and some of the room will not have the air condition working. But Mr Eka the front desk manager is a problem solver. He offered us an upgrade to another branch of theirs in Legian for a day, which is about 5-10min walk to the beach. And the next day when we come back to Seminyak Branch he put in additional 10min Spa for each of us and complimentary airport transfer and some complimentary drink, although it doesn't sound like a big deal but he did made an effort to solve the problem in shortest time possible.

The only problem with their room in Legian, it smells funny w/o the aircon (everytime when you open the door before slotting in the card for the electricity or the aircon). Of course this isn't something Mr Eka can control because it wasn't his Inn. So I will write that on another page.

Most the restaurant are located behind the hotel, and they have a back-door access. Among the good and decent priced restaurant I could think of is Restaurant Made for their Balinese food (not exactly fantastic but its a place to try out the local Balinese food), Buzz Cafe (go for their Nasi Goreng Indonesia). And to the maindoor on the left you will find warung wahaha, which is not bad in my opinion.

A warning to most travellers though, the back door you will find a lot of Currency Exchange Booth with incredible rates, most if not all gives you a premium over what you can get from your home country. For Example SGD/IDR from Singapore is 9150 at best. From the Ngurah Rai (Bali Airport) is 8800. But from the Currency Exchange Booth located behind the hotel and among the pricey restaurant you will find 9700. As a tourist, there are times we tend to overspent our budget which is normal. And usually the last day in Bali you will realized you ran out of cash especially when you didn't noticed there is a 40K-200K per pax departure tax (depending where you are heading).

Back to the currency exchange, you need to be wary because all of them are magicians. Their hands is fast and you need to be attentive. These low life dishonest creatures will short changed you if you are not careful. The hotel itself doesn't have a money exchange services. So it is best you have all the local currencies changed from your respective home country OR change it from the airport itself. Watch this from 2.00 onwards:-

There is a local gourmet supermarket (Bali Deli) which cater usually for Caucasian sells many of the local & foreign products which is 5min walk away from the hotel backdoor - so that gives you an idea of the local market price so you know what you are paying for. Another local store - Bintang Supermarket, but that is about 20 minutes walk away.

The room was OK - I heard the hotel is still new so you are not going to find a lot problems with a new hotel especially. A little bit surprised because they didn't have a fridge so I have to drink my Bintang and Bali Hai Beer warm. The room has a swimming pool view but located too near to the lobby. You wouldn't believe it but its like 10sec walk to the lobby, so it gets rowdy when there is too many excited people in the lobby. And amazingly, there is a sofa chair or some sort designed for people to read while overlooking the pool with peace. Which is good except some nationalities talks just too loud. And being only 1mtr away from our window, so when people talk outside, we can hear them clearly from the inside.

I am a heavy sleeper so not a problem to me. But my wife is a light sleeper so when she woke up the next morning feeling tired and nag in my ears it became my problem. So if I can suggest constructively - please place a ""Keep Quiet - Reading Corner"" or ""Pipe Down - Reading Corner"" sign. Write them in multiple language, 1) English 2) Bahasa Indonesia 3) Chinese

Otherwise, good bed, clean bathroom, nice tv, clean room, hair dryer, security box, friendly people. Not a problem. And try their Spa, it works miracle.",Sense Sunset Seminyak

In fact, I strongly believe that the one aspect that needs improvement would be the choices of foods and beverages for breakfast since I received pretty much the same choices for almost every morning. I believe that more selections and varieties of foods for breakfast would be brilliant enough to allow the hotel to receive a better rating.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
349,PERFECT FOR ME,50,March 2014,"I was in Bali for 10 days, alone on a business trip and was,nt looking for a Bali ""resort hotel""....I,ve stayed in hotels all over the world and think this was the cleanest My laptop was too big for the room safe,but the reception staff were happy for me to check it in with them when I went out (the hotel did feel very safe )Lovely fresh towels,super-cool air con(it was hot as hell outside in the daytime) ,comfortable bed and big flat screen TV with lots of International Channels.Nice little balcony over looking the pool.Internet connection is always a little shaky in Bali,but no major problems.The front IS on a busy road (I couldn,t hear it from my room),but leave by the back door and you have the Bali Deli opposite,an easy place to get taxi,s and lots of shops and cafe,s on the streets behind and an interesting 10 minute walk to the sea.I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe in the area.The staff were super nice,smiling, friendly and helpful.If you are looking for a Bali resort experience with all the frills,this is not for you,The rooms ARE overlooked by the other rooms,but curtains ensure privacy....... If you want somewhere welcoming,cool,safe and clean to come home to after a hot day......its perfect...it was for me.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
350,Lousy,30,February 2014,"Staff were indeed great - like in many places in Bali.

However it's a very noisy hotel, with the canteen and pool noise filling the entire building from 7AM - it's hard to sleep.

Internet wasn't working during my stay.

It's located by a busy road - you can walk towards shops and restaurants on Jalan Kunti though.

Interior is budget hotel grade (as expected)",Sense Sunset Seminyak
351,Dissapointed but great staff,20,March 2014,"Well, I booked the room on the day I wanna checked in. When I called the hotel I asked if there was a room ready in 1 hour or not, I do understand that check in time is 2 pm while I called was almost at 1pm and the girl who answered me said the room will ready in 30minutes so If I come definitely the room will available. I arrived almost at 2 pm and sadly the reception said the room haven't ready yet and need to wait around 30 minutes moreover I have to use that room for work. I tried to explain them and finally they upgraded me to suite room. Arrived at room and the room nice and good. But in bath tub I found hair. The sliding door not even can lock and I felt insecure due to people could walk to the corridor and open the door. TV satellite not good.
Morning I had my breakfast and sorry to say it so terrible. No varieties and looked so massy place. I took fried noodle and it was rotten. After seen the varieties of the menu, i think the hotel no need to hire a chef to cooked it. Taste really Bad. Need more then 15 minutes to do check out process.

But all abve terrible points there were 2 points that I have to give thumb up. The staff really helpful and the fast to solve the problems.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
352,Good Hotel,40,February 2014,"Stayed for 2 nights, the location is approximately 15 minutes by car to Kuta Beach and 5 minutes to Krishna (local souvenir store). No public transportation except taxi near the hotel.

The hotel is quiet and staff are nice. Breakfast are basic, but the pastry was quite good.
The room is normal and the bed was comfortable, all room has a balcony.
Just don't forget to book for non-smoking room for more pleasent stay",Sense Sunset Seminyak
353,Very Pleasant hotel,50,February 2014,"What a great hotel, the staff are very pleasant (special kudo's to Cory and Devi who work at Barelo), the room was clean (and cleaned every day). The front staff will help you as much as they can are pleasant to talk to when you want something. We stayed for 9 days and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
354,Great Value,40,February 2014,"Ive stayed here 2 times now and if we consider the cost, it really is an excellent option.
Of course this is not St Regis or Four Seasons but this place costs less than 10% of the price
of the former and represents truly exellent value.
The property is still new so the rooms are clean and modern, well equipped with free wifi.
Location is good for business (Jl Sunset) or Shopping/Eating and staff performance is also good. My only issue was being woken by some loud people shouting at the pool at 7am (Noise does travel with an open design)",Sense Sunset Seminyak
355,Really great and for a great price,50,February 2014,"The rooms are absolutely fantastic, very clean.
Food is great. Free breakfast.
Service is very good, the staff is really nice, super friendly.
Most of them speak english, not all understand it though, but I don't consider it to be something
negative.
OH!! and its walking distance from many good restaurants and shops.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
356,A good option when in transit - basic but clean and comfortable rooms,30,January 2014,"We were landing in Bali at 11pm, but the villa we had booked wit friends wasn't available until the following day. Consequently we were after somewhere clean, comfortable and reasonably priced in Seminyak to sleep in, prior to moving to the villa.

This hotel ticked all the boxes - modern, clean, reasonably priced, located a short taxi ride away from the dining and shops of Seminyak.

One disappointment was that our pre-booked airport transfer did not turn up, despite having re-confirmed it directly with the hotel 7 hours prior to arrival - although reception were apologetic and said there was a miscommunicaiton with the driver.

The breakfast was fairly average - we arrived at 10.10am (finished at 10.30am) and a lot of the food had run out or was running very low; also no fresh egg station and the staff stood around talking so we had to seek them out to get coffee and tea.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
357,Basic room but clean and functional,30,January 2014,"The room is functional but has no character. Everything works well, the shower is great, the bed is comfortable but our room has a frosted window so we can't see the weather or much natural light. You could be anywhere in the world, there is nothing to say you're in Bali. This is the best functioning room we've stayed in here, but the worst for character. Breakfast is great, an extensive buffet of Indonesian and Western choices. Staff are very friendly and helpful, but when we arrived someone was having an argument at Reception because a large sum had been blocked on their credit card, and there were lots of frustrated people because their rooms weren't ready at 2.30pm. If you stay here be sure to ask for a room with a balcony or at least a proper window!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
358,Standard hotel,30,December 2013,Clean hotel.room -clean and standard.wifi is excellent in the room.breakfast-limited but ok.located close to shopping around seminyak.beware of moneychanger around seminyak-one of them tried to cheat me-counted twice on the table ok then suddenly at the end short.please check amount before leaving amd handing over ur currency.,Sense Sunset Seminyak
359,Fantastic stop over in Bali,50,December 2013,"We had an overnight stop in Bali en route to KL and booked this hotel via www.bookings.com on a 50% discount and were NOT disappointed. Front desk staff on check in were very friendly and accommodating, restaurant/bar staff were the same and our rooms were very comfortable. The only downside is the walls aren't insulated so you hear EVERYTHING. However, the bed was comfortable and we slept right through. The gourmet smorgasboard breakfast included in the price was incredible and ticked all the boxes for our adult children travelling with us.
TIP: book a room with a balcony if you would like to enjoy views overlooking the infinity pool.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
360,nice hotel,30,December 2013,"We stayed in the hotel for 1 nite and find the room is quite nice, clean and neat. big reception area and for a good variety of breakfast (though we find the nasi kuning not well cook), you can relax on the benches by the pool or near the reception.

However the staff are not very attentive nor helpful, we book for three rooms with childrens aboard and we have to struggle by ourself on the baggage and stuffs.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
361,Nice and Affordable,50,November 2013,"I am very choosy when it comes to choice of hotel. I set high standards in this regard and want all the facilities, appearance and grace to be at peak. I got all my desires at Swiss-Belinn Seminyak. The hotel is located on the famous Sunset Road street, one of the happening areas for business. The road leads to the main places like shopping arcades, restaurants, nightclubs, cafes and plenty of other attractions for tourists. I had access to all important places and enjoyed the thrill of island.
The exterior of hotel won my heart in first sight. The elegant design and structure presents picturesque beauty for tourists. As I entered inside, my attention was drawn by a splendid masterpiece, clear blue-watered swimming pool. It entices you to dive in it immediately. My friends were there to receive me at the entrance. I was restless to ask the questions about fun places and popular markets of Bali. They were kind enough to absorb my typical chatty style and provided me with valuable information for making my stay worth remembering at Bali. They showed me the secret path to Jalan Raya Seminyak, the place full of thrill and enjoyment.
Perhaps the most enjoyable thing about the hotel is its Deluxe Rooms. You have choice from 196 luxurious rooms. There are simple Deluxe, Superior Deluxe with Balcony and Grand Deluxe with Balcony and suites. Whichever room you choose, you won’t be disappointed. I chose Superior Deluxe and loved the pleasure in watching 32” TV on soft plush sofas. I enjoyed working on the internet through high bandwidth Wi-Fi on my laptop which is necessary to carry for business traveler like me. I was soothed by a tea and coffee. I enjoyed the comfortable night sleep on big bed with soft pillows.
Talking about food, I wasn’t disappointed by the taste and variety of items. I could discover plenty of meal options even in the breakfast. The breakfast had typical Indonesian flavored dishes as well as home-made yogurts, pasta and cereal. I must say that Swiss-Belinn Seminyak has certainly satisfied my taste buds. The best thing about breakfast was pastries which were extremely crunchy with yummy butter taste. I couldn’t have asked for a better start of a full day at Bali.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
362,I was charged TWICE for my stay,20,September 2013,"I remember making this booking reservation online and paying in FULL September 5. When I checked in at the hotel on September 21, I was told that NO PAYMENT was made on my credit card and that it was only used to confirm the reservation. Well, I received my credit card billing statement today, and I was charged TWICE.

Honestly, I had a very pleasant stay in this hotel. It's very clean and simple. The price is very reasonable, and location is relatively central. Buffet breakfast was good and the reception was very accommodating. I would rate this place as a 4, except this had to happen. So, I hope you can REVERSE this. I've sent an e-mail as well.

Thank you!",Sense Sunset Seminyak
363,Short stay in transit,40,September 2013,"Having been unable to get late checkout from booked hotel decided to book here despite only staying for eight hours. Walked in day before booked and paid (just over $50) for room next day. Agreed early check in for 11:00 and despite some confusion (quickly sorted out) at check in we were checked in. Hotel is new and squeaky clean. Room spacious nice firm bed but no wardrobe just rack with hangers. Bathroom nice, balcony overlooking pool and cool air conditioning makes it all good. Booked massage and despite confirming time on arrival were asked to wait 45 minutes as they were booked?
All that said nothing to put anybody off staying here. Hotel is a little walk away from Seminyak's main busy street but for the price and cleanliness being so good this would be a great place for any short stay in Bali.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
364,Great service and clean rooms.,40,August 2013,"Staff were all helpful and polite, and service was always prompt. And understanding that my flight was departing only in the evening, they allowed me to check out in the late afternoon. Breakfast was a good mix of international and Indonesian food. If you're looking for a hip and happening area though, Swiss-Belinn wouldn't be a good choice. It's in a quiet area of Seminyak, away from the beach.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
365,BRAVO,50,August 2013,"Great work from the team at SB Seminyak - firstly by upgrading me at no extra charge and then by offering me a late check out ay 1800 as complimentary. Front desk were very helpful and remembered by name. The room itself is pretty much a 5* standard room with a soft and comfortable bed with premium linen and the bathroom is fabulous. Personally I'm not a fan of the indoor pool but it's there if you want it and at the price point which was RP500,000 a night the SB offered outstanding value. |It's in a good location for some of the best restaurant and boutiques on the island and I really look forward to comiung back. Teremakasih banyak.",Sense Sunset Seminyak
