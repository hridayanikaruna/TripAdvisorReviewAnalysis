Staff are friendly. Quite hotel environment. Not to far from Seminyak Square. We enjoy at Bali and looking forward to comeback here. Once again, very Big Thank You to everyone.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
1,Smelly & spooky hotels,10,December 2021,"I booked for 3 nights, but i just stayed for 1 night, when i get in the room, room is dark, i take the room on 1st floor, so i have a pool access, bed and pillow are smelly, and have someone knock the door, but no one there! Location is good near the cafe",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
2,Unwelcome since the first moment,10,September 2020,"What a wast of time. Riding along the hotel we saw an advertisement saying a promo price for two weeks. Then, why it checking it, right?

Going to the reception,no greeting at all. trying to explain, the receptionist tell me with a rude tone ""not available today"". okay, I look for next week. She doesn't really seem to understand.. I felt so not wanted there.
Then she tells me to sit and wait. I see other 3 people with luggage waiting. It looks like we're on a line. Maybe someone will come and kindly show me a room? No one explained what we wait for. 10 minutes later the girl speaks in Bahasa to my girlfriend, even f it was only me speaking to her in English before that. Rude again. It appears that we should follow her. Then why waiting for 10 minutes?!

Following her, I try to ask in English why there are so many rooms, but no availability for today? Maintenance. 5 floors, 20 rooms per floor, 2 buildings, that's 200 rooms. okay, not an issue, you don't need too many customers now, I get it.
She shows me a room, very small, smells bad, no balcony, no view. definitely not worth the promo price even.
the receptionist kept being unfriendly, when I asked if they have bigger rooms. Obviously not willing guests in the hotel or just not willing to show me.
On my remarks that it smells bad she just said ""yes, because not ready"". Well, if you want to sell something, you just don't show something in a bad condition.

To the management: Train your staff. This is not the typical Balinese hospitality. I don't care about the price or the room size, but I definitely care about my experience with the staff.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
3,Everything not running well,10,March 2020,"I jus checked out this afternoon and very excited to write my dissapointed comment in Tripadvisor.
1. I got 2 seperate beds and they made it into 1 bed. (Try to understand, maybe they on high occupancy)
2. When check-in , I asked for late c/o rate and they informed me the fee is IDR 100,000 per hour. And this morning, I asked again to their Receptionist and informed me the fee is IDR 50,000 per hour. (Different information)
3. When check-out time, I wish to pay by Mandiri but their EDC Machine was low-battery so we need to process the transaction with BCA with bank fee. They informed the bank fee ONLY IDR 2,000 (without apologize that their Mandiri machine not ready to use, and we charged more)
4. THIS IS THE FINAL
They asked me to wait a moment to check the room conditions and we wait in lobby area. There was 2 Receptionist (1 man and 1 woman) and 1 woman with batik. The woman who wearing Batik called me to the counter and informed me there was a blood spot on the sheet and we need to pay the penalty IDR 25,000 (I just stayed for 1 night and on my period. So I think it’s normal if there’s a blood spot on the sheet. How if guest stay for 5 nights on their period? Should they paid for IDR 25,000 x 5 nights? They even didn’t explain to me). Well it’s not about the money, but the way she informed me made me VERY UPSET! They informed regarding the blood spot in front of all of people there. It very unpolite way. And after we passed the Receptionist, they laughed very hard. It made me so upset and sad.

We decided to NEVER COME BACK AGAIN!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
4,STAFF ARE EXCELLENT,50,February 2020,"Stayed in Alea hotel twice,

specially reception staff are very helpful,friendly
The hotel for the price I got deserved more .

But still if I compare it with other hotels stayed is the best one in this category.
Thank you for your hospitality Alea family",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
5,Great place,50,February 2020,"the location is excellent, close to main street of seminyak and to the restaurants. We are very enjoy stay at the alea hotel seminyak. The pool was great and staff also friendly, i will comeback again to this hotel in the future",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
6,Transit Staycations,30,January 2020,"A budget hotel in Seminyak. Not a big property but feels comfort, the staff was friendly and helpful. The room so simple and clean it’s value for money is rather cheap. Location in good area in Petitenget.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
7,Disgusting hotel that is colluding with booking.com to overcharge and mislead customers,10,December 2019,"This hotel is not what it seems. The pictures provided on numerous booking sites do not in anyway represent the hotel and is extremely misleading. They advertise their rooms as ""deluxe rooms with a pool view""
that is a gross misrepresentation of what
the product actually is. They use
booking.com to mislead customers by stating
the rooms are in high demand and charge
extortionate rates because of this, over 4
times the standard room rate for this
hotel. This would lead one to believe that the hotel is amazing and almost 4 star
quality, when in fact it is worse than most
hostels. They make numerous claims about
the amenities they have at the hotel, such
as wifi (wifi does not work in any part of
the hotel) clean, comfortable - again this
is not true, the rooms are disgusting,
filthy and beds are lumpy. Without a doubt
the worst hotel I've ever had to endure
across the globe. Management and staff are
rude and unhelpful. They'll try and stick
you in a substandard room that you did no
t request, until you complain about paying
a lot more for what they try and give you
, then all of a sudden, more rooms become
available for you to choose from in their
""fully booked"" hotel. I requested a refund
immediately on check in so I could stay
somewhere else and they refused claiming
booking.com are responsible for refunds and
told me to contact them, then when I
contacted booking.com to raise my
complaint, you guessed it, they told me to
speak to the hotel manager! Absolutely
outrageous behaviour to rip customers off
and mislead them into buying their terrible rooms at extortionate prices. Do yourself a favor and stay in a campsite, as it would be a lot better than enduring a tortuous stay at this shack. My pictures represent the room I was given which was advertised as deluxe room with a pool view. Can you see the pool?",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
8,Short Stay,50,January 2020,"We stayed at The Alea Seminyak for 1 night. From the moment we arrived we greeted by a polite and friendly staff.
The room was quite big but little bit ages, also the air conditioning seem not working well during the day but its getting cooler at night.
Overall we love this hotel ambience and service. Just one input is please more attention to certain area of the hotel that need maintainance.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
9,ROOM IS SO DIRTY!!,10,January 2020,"We checked in, smell was so BAD!! We found lots of hairs on the pillow, so many stains on the bed sheet. Bed sheet smells so BAD! We stayed for 15 mins and checked out immediately!! Housekeeping not helpful",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
10,My stay at the Alea,40,December 2019,"The accomodation was great given the price 30$ per night i got from booking.com. the hotel was clean and two swiming pools to cool off the bali heat. The location-seminyak is great, great for a chilled out people. Very close Peti (something) and seminyak beach a taxi will offset you less than 3$. We chose to walk to the beach some of the days",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
11,Sweet okay Place!,30,November 2019,"Me and office coworkers spend our weekend in Alea, we booked 2 rooms and was given on third floor. Rooms is okay, it’s fit for 2 person, bathroom okay with hot water, but the only problem is the Air conditioner, it’s not working properly, it’s not cold at all. We love the long pool, enjoy our swimming time, but afterwards we all have the same problem with the water, it’s too easy make our eyes red and have a breakout on our face skin :( But the breakfast it’s good totally okay.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

13,Fantastic rooms and service,50,December 2019,"Fantastic location for this very good hotel. Rooms were clean and spacious, clean towels daily. Staff were always smiling and saying hello. Big mention to the kitchen team also and the staff there. Had an all you can eat breakfast twice and it set us up for the day. Also had a few burgers, banana smoothies and a mojito mocktail - all refreshing and tasty. Plenty of bars nearby and the beach is only a 15 minute drive on a scooter. (Which was amazing fun) The pools are nice also but the colour was a bit green which could make it off putting to some. Overall a very good stay - thank you.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
14,Honest and Sincere Review for this Hotel,50,December 2019,"First of all, there are two reasons why I decided to stay at this hotel because of the location and the price.

We stayed here for 3 nights from 6-9 December 2019.

When we checked-in, the lady on the receptionist gave us room 424. Actually, I didn’t expect much for this hotel because this hotel only cost us around US$15/night (Rp 200.000). We entered the room, and we found many things such as dirty and damp bed sheets, sticky floor, and dirty bathroom. And the worst part was the AirCon is very hot. Seems like they didn’t do the maintenance on this AirCon. We complained about the AirCon, and the nice guy name Dody Kurniawan (the Duty Manager) gave us a satisfying solution. He asked us to move to another room which was much cooler than 424. This new room was 408. Yes, it was cooler and we stayed at room 408 for the first night.

The second night, this bad thing happened again. Around 3 AM in the morning, the AirCon was suddenly getting hot. We went to the lobby and we complained about the AirCon again. And you know what? They asked me to move to another room, which was 236. So in total, the asked me to change room for 3 times. Honestly, this was my first experience to asked to change room for 3 times. I was wondering that happen to this hotel, why the AirCons didn’t work as they should. Then around 4 AM in the morning, I talked for around 30 minutes with those 2 guys that asked us to move to room 236 and share this experience with them.

And for your information, by the time we asked to move to 236 around 3 AM, that was the time we decided to check-out in the afternoon and I booked another hotel for our last night in Bali. We decided not to stay at this hotel for the last night.

Why I give 5 stars for this hotel? Because the staffs including Dody Kurniawan (the Duty Manager) got the potential to overcome all these issues at this hotel and they all were very nice and also easy to talk with.

NOTE: For management, please do something and make a change. Honestly, I wrote down this constructive review not for me. But for all the management and staffs at this hotel, to make an improvement and change to serve the future customers, BETTER. Thank you",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
15,low budget high service,50,December 2019,"I've been stayed at the hotel for 3 days 2 nights, the room that I was stay are close from the swimming pool, so when I open the window I can see the pool from my door window. room so far so good room amenities are completed. and the breakfast experience so far so good the choices of food are. service was excellent, I'd like to back again soon, thank you for bring us memorable experience!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
16,Small but beautiful,40,November 2019,"It’s a small hotel but beautiful and comfortable. I like the bed, its big, spacious and comfortable.

All the room is non-smoking room, there also refrigerator and electric water boiler.
I don’t see any hair dryer though, or I just missed it.
The check in and check out process a little bit slow, but overall a good experience.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
17,Affordable Price including breakfast,40,November 2019,"With that price, everything is accepted. We did upgrade our room from 312 to 127 that has pool access, and it's worth it. Me and my husband can talk all night at the pool side and still can watch our toddler while she slept. The breakfast is delicious too. Our girl like the taste. Thank you.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
18,Cozy and friendly staff,50,November 2019,"Clean room, quite place, the staff are friendly and very helpful. They serve a lot of breakfast menu and taste good. The swimming pool closed at 8pm. Definitely will come back to stay later. The place is near to some popular cafe, scooter rent and mini market.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
19,Memorable time spent with delightful service,50,October 2019,"We I and My husband loves to travel a lot and for this time our destination was Bali. We make our reservation on alea hotel. What i love about the hotel is caring and loving staff. Our welcome was pleasant and lovely. Specially i would like to appreciate the effort and hospitality given by Dutta, pasek and indah. And I would also like to mention about housekeeping staffs for taking care of our rooms and amenities, moreover they helped us to find our lost properties. Always appreciate care from staffs.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
20,Comfortable Boutique Hotel with Affordable Price,40,October 2019,"+ + : clean hotel, comfortable, quiet place, the bed is soft, pool is working well, air conditioner is cold. Stayed for 3 nights and they clean the room everyday, you just have to put 'maid service' in front of your room, 2 minutes walk to minimart, near night club and some restaurants.

- - : the bed sheets,pillow sheets, and bedcover smell musty. Some furnitures are old and cracked.

Improvement need for hotel cleanliness 👍🏻",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
21,Clean & Cosy Fits the Bill for 3 Star Rating,40,September 2019,"We booked a 3 week stay in Bali, and decided on Seminyak away from the young rowdy touristy crowds. We were not disappointed the resort was central to our needs and the Hotel Alea served us well for what we wanted. However, upon entering our room we were a little disappointed as photos on their website showed the room space to be larger, so our initial shock took a bit of beating at 2am!! on checking in were we allocated a king size room which we turned down as we had requested twin beds from the onset, luckily this wasn't a problem for the staff on reception and we were then allocated Room 203 level with the Lobby/Reception area which was convenient. On 2nd thoughts we decided to check the king size room thinking it would be much larger but it was the same as 203 so we stayed put for the rest our our stay in 203. The layout of the room was not the best designed with the wash basin in the bedroom!! other than that the shower was great with hot water and the general cleansiness was good. The hotel looses on 1 more rating, as it's wifi connection was terrible! going off intermittently then having to keep logging on frequently which was quite frustrating and no access for international calling, I only requested this as my mobile started to play up and needed to call home in UK. The breakfast was average for a 3 star hotel basic but catered our needs. A negative was seeing distressed fish in the breakfast area in the aquarium the water was disgustingly dirty and smelly! with fish dying!! I guess waiting to be cooked for a breakfast dish, this affected us more since we are strict vegetarians!! The best positive was all the staff on Reception they were fantastic and couldn't do enough to help, always smiling and willing to go the extra mile of anything asked of them no matter how early/late in the day. The standard of customer care and attention to detail were always at the forefront and in our case met without any issues, this was especially true when we asked a member on reception whose name I can't recall now went over and above to book us 2 different hotels for our stay in Ubud, he definitely deserved a tip and we were so grateful for his time and patience in sorting it out. This extra work took him away from his usual duties and he did this smiling without showing any kind of stress. In addition to hotel facilities the spa was the next best thing after a hard day of touring coming back to have a foot and leg massage we were in haven and it was the best one I had compared to other spas such as Bodyworks & 4 Points Sheraton the latter being close to our hotel and the benefit of it being open till 10pm. I guess it would help if the Spa extended it's closing time to 10pm rather than 9pm as it was a struggle to get booked in if we got back late from a tour and a meal out. All in all this was a good hotel and a very busy one with average rates, if you aren't bothered about luxury and just want to put yr head down for the night then we recommend this hotel. Thank you all at The Alea we hope to return one day. Indu & Versha.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
22,Honeymoon spent well,50,September 2019,"I decided to pick The Alea Hotel Seminyak after browse quite sometime because this is for our honeymoon. The hotel is located in famous area of Seminyak and you can easily found convenience store and just want to grab a beer.

The Hotel is just what I imagine, it's clean and very comfortable. The breakfast is also great just to start your day to travel around Bali. The best part of this hotel is the swimming pool, they have 2 pools so we don't have to scramble with other guest.

Such a great experience and thank you so much Alea Hotel Seminyak for the warm hospitality. Will surely recommend this hotel and stay again whenever I visited Bali.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
23,Doesn't even deserve one star,10,September 2019,"The room was very dirty. The shower was broken too. The bed was disgusting, especially the pillows. It smells like the sheets & cover never been changed, it reeks. Already complained to the staff and asked them to at least change the sheet but they simply say that they can't because they don't have any clean sheets, but we had just checked in, so is it still the same sheet from the previous guest?? Still had some more nights already booked and paid in full which we fully regret, but after one very uncomfortable and sleepless night, we were too disgusted that we decided to find another hotel. When we checked out and tell the reception about the problem and asked for refund, they refused.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
24,Do not stay in this hotel!!!,10,August 2019,"My boyfriend and I had this hotel booked for ten nights. When we checked in we were given our room which was 309. It was so dirty, the sheets were dirty, the room was generally unclean. The full hotel needs renovated it is appalling! We complained and moved room which wasn’t any better. The sheets were stained so we asked for the sheets to be changed. When they were changed they were still stained. The hotel is down a dirt road and has lizards everywhere. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We checked out after one night and we’re not offered a refund. I am very disappointed at the service and standard of this hotel and if I’d stayed here it would have ruined my holiday.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
25,My first trip to bali and my stay at the Alea hotel seminyak,50,October 2018,"The alea hotel seminyak is highly recommended stay for comfort kindness close to all things shopping food and tours. I stayed with my best friend and it was both our first time in bali and from the moment we arrived the service was impeccable I can not fault a thing. We were created by name on arrival given a nice clean cloth to refresh ourselves because it was so hot and I mean hot. Our luggage was taken to our room which was beautiful smelled like heaven and so clean and you step out straight to the pool. Best room ever. Our room was serviced everyday with clean linen and towels and I don't know what they use but I absolutely loved the smell of my bed every night I hopped in it. The staff are so efficient and there when ever u want or need something even organising dinner to be delivered at midnight coz we were hungry lol. Every morning breakfast was amazing with many traditional Balinese food and I was excited to eat the way the Balinese people eat because I wanted to experience the culture as much as I could and all the staff at the alea hotel made that possible. I especially would like to thank komang trinadi for the attention and service she made for our stay that girl is an asset to that business and if I owned a hotel in bali I would be blessed to have her as an employee she is amazing and went beyond her duties to make our experience there 5 stars. While in bali it was my 40th birthday and while having breakfast in the dinning room ALL THR STAFF came and sang happy birthday to me and gave me a cake with candles and I made a wish it was such a surprise as it wasn't mentioned but obviously someone took notice of that and then when I got back from my tour that evening I had a bunch of flowers and a monkey teddy and the words ""happy bday sarah"" written with petals on my desk. Attention to details is what The Alea Hotel is all about with making you feel important and not just another customer. I have recommend this place to stay to all my friends and family for their future bali holidays. I will definitely be coming back.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
26,In the heart of Seminyak,50,January 2019,"We loved our stay, very nice location in Seminyak area, very near to pretty much all the hip places in Seminyak.

27,Alea Hotel,40,July 2019,Excellent room and worth it. I choose pool access room. My favourite is Alea Hotel is quite and strategic location. Thank you for the hospitality by the way. I enjoyed every moment at Alea Hotel Seminyak.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
28,Excellent!,50,June 2019,"The room is nice although there is a little spot on the bed when i checked in...
Recommend to have a room on ground floor which have access to the pool...
If you are a smoker, just open the sliding door and easly went to the pool to smoke or for swimming...
The staff is nice and friendly...",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
29,Love the convenience,50,June 2019,"I have nothing much to complain from a budget hotel like this. I love the bedroom, the AC and hot shower worked very well. For the location, it's amazing. Great restaurants and cafes nearby. Staff members were helpful. Security guard probably should smile a bit more. I like the 3rd floor, not too high to go up the stairs. The view of the pool is beautiful.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
30,Dirty and smelly,10,June 2019,"We decided to chose another hotel because the sheets were dirty and the bathroom smelly. Too expensive for what it is.
Not like the pictures. The windows were broken, the room was far from being new. The personal was nice though. Try another one.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
31,Amazing stay,50,December 2018,"Stayed here for a couple of nights on my business trip. The location was not far from the main street, yet its quietness gave me pleasant sleep. Nice restaurants could be reached in minutes by walking. Traffic could be terrible for car. Room size was small, but suitable for me. Everything was clean, and the hot shower was perfect. The pool was nice and enjoyable. Parking space for car was adequate. Staffs gave very warm welcome and fast check in. Highly recommended budget hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
32,Strategic location,20,May 2019,"I went to Bali last weekend to attended my friends' wedding near the hotel, around 10 minutes. So another friend of mine recommended me to stay here. I stayed for 1 night.
Around the hotel there are some convenience store, pubs, cafe and restaurant.
If you stay 2 nights they will provide you free motorcycle rental during the period of stay.

Some improvement points are:
- the room is a bit dark. Especially the bath room.
- hot water tooks a few minutes and sometimes it did not run consistently.
- air conditioner was not cool enough. I did not complain this during my stay because it was only 1 night though. But regular inspection should have been taken by the management.
- check in and check out duration tooks some time. They asked me to wait to be processed. When I was proceeded to check out, there was only 1 receptionist in charge. He was handling 3 customers and he asked me to wait to recheck the other cleaning team and asked me to wait. Eventually he forgot to conformed me. Somehow it waste my time.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
33,Great For Honeymooner,40,May 2019,"My partner and I stayed at the alea as a honeymooner. The room was great, clean and relaxing.

Regret to say that the wifi connection is so slow and need to be improved!..
The rest is just good ! Thank you for having us...",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
34,NOT CLEAN !!!!,20,May 2019,"was stay here with a friends and this is what ihave to inform to the management. i booked 3 rooms and leave a message to choose 2 twin and 1 king bed. Hotel agreed by message on Booking.com. nevertheless when we arrived, and confirm this request they asked additional charge and or upgrade room and pay more. I rather choose not, also they did not offering a welcome drink and or bellboy to escort the guest. in channel 1 they show everything from welcoming the guest until escort to the room, again for me it is oke. room is good but a bit dark, the worst thing is in the bathroom. You may see the picture i have attached here. the front deak agent is nice and willing to help you. Overall the hotel is good, location a bit far from the main street. If you are looking for a plcae only for stay this is you may choose. If you are looking a place for relax and easy access to everywhere, find other hotel according to your budget. Thank you The Alea staff.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
35,small rooms lovely staff,40,April 2019,"This hotel is suited in a great area, just a five minute walk from some amazing eateries! KYND community, Coffee Cartel, Ling Ling’s just to name a few!

The staff are so lovely and very helpful, ready to help at any time or answer any queries.

The pool while on the small side is nice to swim in, very easy to get in a private swim in, and natural light floods the strip around midday.

The buffet breakfast is good for the money, I recommend the banana fritters (Pisano Goreng) It is mostly Indonesian style food, noodles, cooked meats and rice, but it does have the continental offerings of pastries. Had to stick to these as I’m a vegetarian, but I didn’t leave hungry.

I was travelling with a friend and thought I had specified twin beds but we were greeted with one, big bed, which was very spacious, but not exactly what we wanted. When we asked all the other rooms with twins were booked out which was a little disappointing. The room is decent enough if on the small side, but we did get pool access right out of our sliding windows which was worth it.

Overall we had a nice stay and it was definitely value for money.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
36,Our lovely home in Bali!,50,May 2019,"I really don't have any idea about Alea Hotel Seminyak so I've done my research and saw all the pictures! What you'll see is its true reflection. I admire the place for having its strategic location, good facilities, delicious food and warm and very accommodating staffs. We had a tour in Bali of course but we also had a day spent in the hotel just relaxing on the cool ambiance, enjoying our room and tasting the delicious food. It's not as high end as others but you'll definitely love this place. Bali is love",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
37,Worst hotel experience,20,May 2019,"First of all, thanks to all staffs in the reception desk who have been very helpful. I should give this hotel 1 star, but for them, I give an extra star.

But, I've never spent a night in a musty, dirty hotel before I checked in to Alea Hotel Seminyak.

I booked a pool-access room for 4 nights. On the first day, they gave me room number 121. They told me to wait because the house keeping is cleaning the room. Yet when I came in to the room, I found ants teeming around a dead bug in front of the sink. The room smells musty and the worst part is the bed sheets are damp. I immediately asked for another pool access room.

Then, they sent me to 119. Smaller room, still smells musty, the sheets are still damp, but better. Just a little bit better. Again, I asked for another room upstairs where everything is wayyyy much better the next day.

Finally, I got the 202 (not a pool access room). It was better. Still smells a bit musty, but the sheets are clean.

My advice is, if you really on a tight budget, you can stay here as long as you're not in the pool-access room. Also, you need to be adamant to the staff.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
38,Un maintained hotels,20,March 2019,"I booked for one night only. I was giving a chance for this hotel and was hoping the room will be clean enough for us to sleep with after going out in seminyak area. Unfortunately this hotel seems unmaintained. Indeed the room interior was modern, but overall the room was not very small, not clean and smells a bit musty. Even the bed sheet has stain on it. The room is very small and have very limited open air.
We were directly moved to international brand hotel as i was unable to stayed in that musty smells room. I have no time to argue with the management as i was having tight schedule and don’t wanna ruins the night. Even tho i was booked this room for a cheap price, but i feels so disappointed because when i said i want to checkout the management didn’t even ask me why.
Hopefully they can improve the cleanliness in the future.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
39,Good stay,40,February 2019,"First time stayed here. The room is worth the price. Polite staffs and the pools are lovely in peaceful setting & I had access to the pool from the room. Unfortunately, they've broken their own rules they've made. I had to wait around 20 mins before check-in. The sheets were dirty and the air conditioning didn't work well. Well, overall good stay!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
40,Worst hotel ive ever stayed in,10,February 2019,"Awful hotel, the rooms where so hot the air con didnt work, the bed sheets didnt get changed for the 6 days we was there after asking every day we ended up leaving the hotel early. We was asking for a iron for 3 days and towels and was being told they have none. Staff was not helpful at all and very rude towards us when asking about the airport shuttle they have advertised on the booking.com page they said ‘we dont have’",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
41,DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL!!!!,10,February 2019,"Worst place I have ever stayed in my life. Came back to my room one night to find my passport ripped in half, my make up had been tipped out all over my suitcase and clothes making nothing wareable and money had been stolen from my purse I kept in a bag. The bed sheets didn’t get changed once despite us asking numerous times. Everything we asked for, little things such as an iron, the staff would say they don’t have unless we persisted to which we get what we asked for 2 days later. The staff where rude and abrupt an not at all helpful. I can’t say whether it was the staff that ripped my passport and stole my money but it couldn’t really have been anyone else and I have never known anything so malicious. Having to fly back to the UK an pay for an emergency passport was not how I planned on ending my trip. AVOID.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
42,Hub for traveling,50,January 2019,"What a good place to stay. Service was great, view was amazing, clean rooms, and overall this is a recommended place. It is also a quiet hub within the busy town for a peaceful retreat after a long day.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
43,Nice pool view,40,December 2018,"I stay for one night, they have a nice pool, the room was also good, spa is available here so you can relax while you on vacation or doing some business trip.
The price is very friendly and near to Potato Head, and Woobar, it took 15 minutes to walk.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
44,Need major improvement,20,January 2019,"I will give honest review,the only best thing for this hotel was their people. The receptionist was nice and helpful,they gave us early check in around 11am also help us to contact rentals.
Hotel lobby is terrible...so dark,the sofas look so old, also you need to climb the stairs to get to the reception.
Room size were okay,but it felt so humid...the worst part was so many stains,holes in the blanket and pillow cover. I think they have potential but the management really need to pay attention.
Also the location was quite far from the main street.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
45,Very bad,10,January 2019,Bad.. worst place I have been in my life.. they don’t even change the sheets on the bad .. all so dirty. I don’t know who you can sleep on a sheets from other people sleep there before.. so loud from the pool .. Chinese people with kids . Scream in the morning at 7h .. terrible,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
46,Very unsatisfied,20,January 2019,"The only good thing about this hotel is the location and the price.

Other than that:
1. The floor was sticky when I checked in.
2. The next day we moved to another room; the AC was not cold
3. The water for the shower was not hot, the water flow in the toilet was weak
4. The floor was still sticky and felt uncleaned.
5. Wifi didn't work at night, it seemed they have a limit for a certain number of connections
6. I complained the next day early in the morning so they can fix it before I came back at night, but nothing was done. The receptionist said the engineer didnt receive any order to fix the AC and the water in my room.
7. I complained about the wifi and they couldn't fix it

Conclusion: I will not go back and dont recommend this hotel to others. There are others hotels with the same price with much better service.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
47,Smells bad,20,December 2018,"Stayed here for one night. As soon as we entered the room there was a strong moldy smell. Not sure what caused the smell, not the bedding sheet. Suspect the wall, the furniture, or the sofa. The breakfast is not so delicious. Location wise also quite far from the seminyak center.
Pros:
We got nice location just beside the pool. Fast and good service.

Please improve somehow the moldy smell is so annoying",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
48,building without the good service is not good.,30,November 2018,"modern, value for money, but seems nothing to offer other than the room. well, it's spacious. but their service is somehow just so so. like it's just there, like it or not.

recommended for honeymooners with budget consideration. don't bring child, they'll get bored. oh the pool is tidy.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
49,Great location good staff,40,October 2018,"Hotel is very affordable and accommodating. Breakfast was good with made to order eggs. Hotel itself could use some upgrades. Pool was nice.

50,Smelly Room 108,30,October 2018,"For budget hotel I don't expect good service (although the staff is very friendly), neither good room.
Many aspect that I can complaint, but I don't want to.
However, only 1 thing that I have to complain:
The bed sheet and pillow cover is smelly and feels humid since the day-1 I stay. I question if those are cleaned/replaced everyday.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
51,Highly recommended!,50,September 2018,"I highly recommend this place if you'r ever down this way. Clean, modern and the service is great! They even surprised me with a cake on my birthday! They are also close to many shops! Thank you so much Alea hotel! I really enjoyed my stay in Bali and I will definitely come back!! <3",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
52,Oldie but not a Goodie,30,September 2018,The Hotel us only around 5 years old but is showing many sign's of wear and tear. There seems to be no up keep of the facilities and even though it is a mid range price it was full the whole time of my stay. I think the owners need to put some money into keeping it to a clean standard. The sheets were very stained and had holes in them. There is paint chips and scratch marks in the room and in time it will just get worse. Great location and a quick walk to the beach. On the plus side it is a quite area.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
53,Value for money,30,September 2018,"The location quite good but need 2 minutes walking to reach the main road, breakfast quite good, the staffs very friendly. But related to the cleanliness, i'm disappointed, when we entered the room, the floor is very dusty, the bedsheet also smelly. Need some improvement on that.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
54,My 1st Abroad trip!,30,May 2018,I was their on May 2018 with my family. The hotel was nice & services was great too. The buffet breakfast was fantastic & lots of variesties to choose from. I enjoyed my whole 4 nights stay there but sadly couldn't enjoy the pool area as much as I wanted.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
55,Just for the Night,40,August 2018,"Have a family Holiday in Bali, I will be arriving one day earlier, just browsing for hotels near the are, which to my surprise still can find very cheap $20 USD / night, just book, ready some terrible review and some good one, but for $20 pretty much nothing to complain about, you get what u paid, Check-In is fast one guy very welcoming while the check-in lady seem to rush anything, she explains to me briefly about rooms, bf when I didn't hear clearly, and ask again, it seems she does not happy-cannot complain, :D, room as described in many reviews, adequate, a little damp here and then, bed and towel not cleaned enough, again for $20, nothing to complain about, I just stay few hours for the night, its good enough, amenities also sufficient, wifi is not working well, maybe my room was not in the best position, its pretty slow as well, Check-out, just drop the key, and have to wait for the same lady again to check rooms condition, a treatment that I am not receiving in quite a long time, they need to check wether anything is missing? :D again and again, cannot complain, overall is a good value hotel, with mix nice and average staff",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
56,Unhelpful staff,30,August 2018,"Budget hotel in Seminyak, good location. Room is OK but rather small. Bathroom is not ok. The shower floor slopes to the wrong direction, not to the drainage, so the floor will never get dry and a lot of water on the wrong side of the drainage. Toilet water come out all nights, we called engineering but only quick fix and after we flush it happened again, all night we hear the sound of water, we thought that the house keeping will take care of it when they clean the bathroom, but it did not happen. Called engineering again the following afternoon after we left in the morning. We stayed for 3 nights, the bathroom was not cleaned and the towels were not changed. Breakfast is OK but staff was chatting amongst themselves. Front desk staff were unhelpful and had no empathy. The hotel is lacking attention. Will not come back.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
57,A budget hotel with great locations and pool view,30,August 2018,"I stayed in the room No. 208.
The Sink (Hand wash & toilet flush) needed to be fixed. Since it didn't absorb the water well.
Also, the bed sheets and bed cover looked clean but if you take a closer look there were some stains here and there.
We need extra towel for the hand and feet towel. Since you have small bathroom with wet treatment.
Even the Spring bed was not comfy, cos it did not bounce the back of your body.
I like the hotel cos it has a very strategic location, very spacious parking lot and friendly staff.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
58,Decent hotel good value,40,August 2018,"Even though room is a little on the small side but with pool access especially on the ground floor it’s still a bargain. Great services from the staffs highly recommended. Our flight is in the night and we were allowed to leave our luggage after checked out with the hotel and there’s no time limit on how long u want keep it with them.

So walk around killing time around town and come back claim your bags and head to the airport.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
59,Great Hotel and wonderful staffs,40,August 2018,"The Alea hotel is a great place for the family. We had a good time there.
Most of the staffs are friendly and helpful. Putu (receptionist) she was very helpful and friendly.
Everything was great except, they do not many amenities, they don't provide extra waters and room just okay.
anyway, we enjoyed a lot and thank you all of you for your great hospitality",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
60,Hotel Room,20,July 2018,"AC is not working, when we informed the housekeeping, a staff came to clean the filter and that's all ... no cool air at all for three nights, the floor is sticky, shower soap was smelly and no refill of coffee on the last night stay, when we called housekeeping, no answer. Shower hose was also broken in both rooms",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
61,"bed sheet is dirty, not helpful staff",30,May 2018,"Alea is one of the cheapest hotel in Seminyak. If you are the tourist who doesnt really matter about cleanliness and comfort, Alea is a good choice.

When we booked the room by agoda, we already told them in notes that we want early check in. We were confirm by phone too. But when we came, they said we must wait until the check in time.

Second, after we find out that our bed sheet and towels are dirty, we ask for changing especially for pillow sheet. And they said, they bed sheets are out of stock. Oh come on!

Earlier after check in, I heard receptionist was received room call who ask for bed sheet change too. I guess almost all their bed sheet are dirty. :(

Alea's room is minimalist.
Swimming pool is small but nice
Their swimming pool is good place for take picture.
Wifi is not working",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
62,Budget hotel in hype location,40,May 2018,"I love how affordable the room rates were. I love how they designed their interior so nicely and I love how clean my room was! This hotel is so Bali and it is strategically located, within walking distance from hype bistros and cafes in Seminyak area. However, the only thing I didn't like was their breakfast quality.. it just wasn't good enough and there aren't much breakfast joints around either. Thus, when my friend and I decided to find another breakfast by walk, we went back and sticked with what we had instead. But overall, it was a really nice stay though!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
63,Good hotel,50,May 2018,"Although it isn't located at main street, but its location is easy to reach and find. This room and bathroom are big enough. It has an outdoor swimming pool. It is very comfortable staying here. The room rate also very reasonable.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
64,On the budget side,30,April 2018,"I visited the alea hotel with my wife and two daughters. Upon check the staff was friendly and helped us to bring our luggage. It was enough room space for us little family. Bathroom was alright, but towel is abit in poor condition, the color has turned to darkside. My sugesstion is that ask for the new towel, they will bring you some better one. Pool was big enough for kids to have fun and play around. Our breakfast was ok, they have vareity that we can choose from rice menu to porridge then pancake and egg station. Overall for breakfast it was a decent on considered on the room price that we provided with. In the end i will be back to this hotel, if they are doing little bit maintanance on their room to make it nicer.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

66,nice hotel with friendly staff,50,January 2018,"it was our 2nd stay in the alea for 10 days and it was great as our first stay 2 years ago. we had a room with pool access and they provided us with a infant bed/cot for our 13 months baby. the service was excellent and the staff were all super friendly. the food was much better compared to 2 years ago and we ordered the room service almost every day. we loved the fried duck with traditional recipes, chicken satay and fried rice.. so yummmiii!!! just 10 minutes walking to the beach with the access close to w hotel and easy to find mini markets and laundry. definetely will back to the alea again. recommended as one of the best budget hotel in seminyak area.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

71,My curiousity was killed..its a nice place to stay..,40,December 2017,"Despite all the low rating review I read, I decided to pick this hotel for my 3 days stay in Bali. I was given the 101, just after the stair down to the pool. The room was small, but enought for 2 people. This hotel needs more details in cleanliness. There is a mini market within walking distance. In fact the hotel is not too far from the Seminyak main street. One thing I love is, they have a secure storage room for my mountain bike!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
72,One of best price-quality relation in Bali,40,December 2017,"One of the best price-quality relations in Bali. They are a little bit slow at reception but eventually they solve problems or change room if necessary. Great location, follow the road to the beach avoiding the caos of main road. 5 star breakfast in spacious place. Great swimmingpool, 2 of them. Big bed. Scented shampoo and gel provided. Very good flip flops provided. A place almost to stay for 1 year! Highly recommended!! Pablo from Spain. Thank you.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
73,Nice!,40,November 2017,"(+) Booked a room online. Nice place, quiet room. Quick check in, check out process.

(-) No one was incharge at the pool, so I needed pool towel, the Reception had me to go to the bar near the pool. Nobody was there and no clean towel. Shame.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
74,Damp and underwhelming,20,December 2016,"There are no interconnecting rooms in this hotel, just adjacent ones.... Our rooms opened up to the swimming pools (which is the best thing in this hotel). The public areas are much nicer than the hotel rooms.

The rooms had a damp smell which was not pleasant. This is definitely one of those hotels where the photos look better than the actual place.

Breakfast was ok, and it is within walking distance to the beach (though through a lot of lanes and unmarked paths).",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
75,Dreadful and depressing,10,October 2017,"For starters this hotel should not be considered as Seminyak- horrible location at least 15 minute walk to the beach and more than half an hour walk to central Seminyak.
The rooms are so small we could barely open two suitcases. Drabby towels and no such thing as an ensuite as the basin is outside the bathroom?!?
You can not get any sun at the pool as the walls are so high and compact. Not to mention the non existent pool bar.
The breakfast was appetising and dirty plates and saucers.

We left after one night- could not even bare 24 hours.
If you're after an excluded, ghost town hotel.. this is your spot.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
76,Very Good Budget Hotel!,40,September 2017,"with a very affordable price, the hotel is very nice. The pool and the room is nice.
Although the room was small but the noise from other rooms was not heard. If you just want to sleep at night, this hotel is a recommendation. There is a view of the rice fields also beside the hotel and very close if you want to get around in Seminyak.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
77,Nice little hotel,50,January 2017,"The alea hotel is a nice little hotel. If you are looking for a big flash hotel then this is not for you. I purchased my accommodation for the alea through scoupon and was pleasantly surprised, it’s located in a nice quiet area of Seminyak away from the hussle and bussle. There are lots of nice restaurants around the area so don’t be afraid to go out for a walk or grab a taxi!
Hotel staff were very friendly and the day spa is very good!
Only downfall was large groups of Chinese? Tourists staying at the hotel tend to eat all the breakfast and are not the cleanest and will just sit at your table.
Will stay again at the Alea! Thank you!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
78,Very relaxing and friendly.,40,September 2017,"The staff are very happy, friendly and helpful. You have a day spa upstairs with a very good masseuse. Food is very well cooked. Air con works great. Shower prone to flooding if running too hard. A lot of fun places to visit nearby and very close to beach!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
79,FRIENDLIEST STAFF,40,August 2017,"We've been travelling since 1990, and the staff at this hotel has been the nicest and friendliest we have come across. Even though we were a bit disappointed with the size of the room, the staff had made it a very pleasant stay.
At the Reception, Putu, Dodi and especially Dewi were very helpful and pleasant. Dewi even surprised me with a beautiful birthday cake for my 60th birthday.
At the Restaurant, the manager Adi introduced himself to us. He is a lovely guy and his staff all seem to love him. The chef, Asong was also very friendly and even asked for our opinions on a new dish he wanted to introduce to the menu. The girls - Sri, Mila, Selma,Trinadi and others were all so always full of smiles and cheerful when we walk in the restaurant every morning for breakfast. Sri, my favourite girl was very kind and thoughtful. She could not do enough for us to make us welcome and happy. The Security guys were also always pleasant and helpful.
We wish the staff and management all the best. Sending all our love & regards, Myra & Ron",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

81,DO NOT BOTHER !!,10,July 2017,"We did all the research into the Hotel before purchasing a stay for 10 days ... the reviews are obviously written by friends and family of the Hotel owner as they are far from the truth.
We arrived and the room was small but clean, we went for a meal as it was mid evening the food was passable, but no cocktails available which we assumed was because of the late hour.
We went for breakfast the food was inedible and you had to wait for the horde of locusts to get their food first. We went out all day returned to Hotel and decided to have another go at the food but again no cocktails available just beer and soft drink ... again the food was inedible. We stayed the night, had a shower in a shower that wasn't working as the water came out the top not out of the shower head.
We went into Seminyak as the Hotel is not a walk able distance from the main street of Seminyak, although the shuttle was free. We located another Hotel to stay at as we could not stay here another day.
We went back packed our bags and checked out. The Manager came and chatted with us and admitted that the upgraded rooms were no different from any other room apart from being a step closer to the pool. The advertised pool bar and restaurant bar were not open as the Hotel had NO LIQUOR LICENCE ...
The staff themselves were lovely but the advertised Hotel and services were a complete and utter lie.
Do not bother to stay here until they can live up to their advertised hype.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
82,Fantastic value & wonderful staff...................,40,June 2017,"To put this review in perspective, we travelled on a Scoopon deal which cost us AUD$499 for BOTH of us for 10 nights. Included was daily breakfast, return airport transfers, 2 meals each, 2 massages each & 2 welcome drinks. To say that that is phenomenal value is an understatement.........
Our late night pickup from the airport went smoothly, check in at the hotel was very quick & our bags were delivered promptly to our room. From start to finish, we found ALL of the staff friendly, courteous & very obliging in all aspects of customer service. Our room was on the small side but we were well prepared for that & had no pre conceptions of grandeur. Our room (# 110) had pool access so we only had to walk out the sliding door then onto the deck to access 2 lounges & then straight into the pool. We had absolutely no issues with the free Wifi as it was always available & the bathroom had a fabulous rain head shower with an abundance of hot water. Room service food was always prompt & tasty (club sandwiches with fries was our fave) & our initial request for wine glasses in the room & a daily supply of ice cubes was no trouble at all for the staff. The housekeeping guys were wonderful & we let them know that we would leave out our coins & small notes each day for them to take (usually less than AUD$2) which they were most appreciative of. On day 3 our towels were changed over to brand new, white, fluffy towels & this continued on for the rest of our stay.
The hotel is situated in a very quiet spot & is within easy walking distance to both the beach & the bustle of the main drag. There is a bakery, 2 mini marts & a laundry service in the same street.
My impression of this hotel's staff / management is that they are continually striving to improve themselves & take on board constructive customer advice.
P.S. A big shout out to The Alea Security guys who were always smiling & friendly. They were very courteous & polite, always there to open car doors for hotel patrons & to help out with carrying shopping bags.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
83,"Great hotel and staff , but...",40,May 2017,"I've chekin in alea quit long time since 4 may until 15 ,
staff very friendly and location in my opinion is perfect not too far from center and they provide suttel bus to seminyak square,

my room was quite nice pool view sight, clean and comfortable, but the size of the room just 22sqm , for me its bit small space, and no direction for kiblah to mecca for muslim..

the breakfast at restaurant was ok not too good not bad just ok,

I was disturbing every night and every morning by the chines tourists group, they chating to each other so loud cant sleep well, and they are so annoying , screaming and yelling , live will better with then

otherwise the hotel gave me great services and birthday surprise, thanks to management and staff especially for dewi.

Dewi at reception who gave me first aid when i needed help for the cut on my calf. She was exceptionally helpful and is lovely!! :))

They have a really nice quiet pool, and the hotel is just 3mins walk to Jalan Petitenget, and abt 15mins walk to Potatohead beach club. So everything is pretty convenient. The only thing is that the towels can be abit old sometimes.

Definitely a nice place to stay with very reasonable price. :)",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
85,Great budget hotel,40,April 2017,"I've been to this place twice since last year. The hotel staffs are friendly and provide a very good services for budget hotel. The room is clean and comfortable.

The only downside is the hotel location is a lil bit walking distance from main road but still managable.

Ps: get the pool access room if you can (can be noisy sometimes but it really fun when you can jump to the pool right beside your room)",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
86,Short stay,30,March 2017,"This is a botique hotel. Small rooms basic facilities but inexpensive. The stay at the hotel was good as we can accept any short commings due to the price. Staff and service were excellent, room and facilities were good, room and premises were neat and clean. Location was fair depending on what your requirements were as it was located towards the end of a 'dead end' road. Access to the beach (300 metrea+ away) was down to the end of the road and down a private path. Access via the path ceases at 9.30 pm as the gate was locked and it was a long walk home via the beach and other roads. The hotel provided a once a day one way trip to the Seminak Mall shopping area. Breakfast is not provided in the price but for A$5.00 per day break is provided. This must be booked and paid for at the book in time. They have two long lap pools but unfortunately due to the location of the units the sun only hits the pools between say 11am and 1pm.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
87,Very good experience.,40,March 2017,My stay at the a.le.a hotel in Seminyak this week has been a very good experience. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff are very helpful..

The location is strategic, nearby the beach (only 5 minutes walk) and trendy hang-out places in Seminyak such as Potato Head, W, Motel Mexicola and many others. The receptionists were very friendly, esp Mbak Dewi and Mas Putra. Paddy rice field next to the hotel makes this hotel a perfect choice!! Good Rate as well!!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
89,Horrible Room and breakfast,10,February 2017,"I stayed in this hotel a month ago,
The room was dirty, the bedsheets and the bedroom so dirty, torn towel,
The breakfast was terrible, over cook omelette, not fresh fruits, dirty tables and chairs, luckily I only stayed for one night,,,",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
90,Best Place after Hard Party Night,40,June 2016,"stay in this place after having a hard party night at the Club in Seminyak. the location make the hotel feel so comfy and quiet, perfect for hangover cure. the price is reasonably cheap and the quality is also good. Breakfast is good",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
91,Disappointed,10,February 2017,"I'm sorry to say I checked in on a scoopon deal for $399 in a pool access room and checked the very next day. The whole place needs a good clean. Our bed linen and towels were grey and stained when we moved in and again after the made up the room the next day. Spent a very uncomfortable night in that bed. Don't care about the size of the room .....would just like a clean bed to sleep in. Not sure what was available for breakfast as we couldn't get past the filthy toaster, grubby crockery and bowls of butter, jams, sugar etc with a knife stuck in the middle and all the mess on the breakfast bars. Not even a coffee cup that felt like it was clean. We left and went to the room for coffee.
Agree with what everyone is saying about the staff..........they were all awesome (except for the one who stole a can of drink from the mini bar while the room was being ""cleaned"")
Definitely no complaints about the rest of the beautiful staff.
Sorry Alea we defiantly won't be back. You need to clean up your act and maybe buy a bottle of bleach to clean the stains from the grey and stained sheets, towel and even the bathroom floors.
We were kindly offered a different room but declined as it wasn't going to change the state of the linen or the grotty breakfast presentation. Been to Bali over 20 times during the last 26 years and never saw the need to complain about a hotel or restaurant before.
Ì showed photos to the front office manager at the time of the dirty linen and shower and even he appeared shocked.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
92,You get what you pay for,30,January 2017,"We stayed there for 9 nights, during Christmas and New Years.
The locations is pretty far, ugly, poor lighting and lots of potholes in the alley where the hotel is located.
The hotel as its self is ok, the staff were very friendly and although young they try be helpful all the time.
We got a room with pool access. The room was much smaller than the pics, poor in storage and very dark. No place to unpack or hang your clothes.
The breakfast was served on the rooftop restaurant, it's was kind of nice but very bad maintained, the sofas that at sometime in there life were white, had a dirty color and appearance.
The buffet had a few western options, and fruits were displayed open air with lots of bugs flying around and without any kind of refrigeration. Like get some ice!!!
If you are looking for budget hotel and are planning to just be there to sleep, It's just fine. Otherwise you'll regret it.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
93,Lovely place,40,February 2017,"The hotel is not in a fast paced neighborhood, a car might be needed to get places. The hotel is very nicely decorated and the room was small but nice. We slept well. The dinner at the 3rd floor restaurant had the best mushroom cream soup, and the asparagus/crab soup was also delicious. The breakfast buffet was average. The long pools are great if you have a pool access room, which we did. Booked a week but due to issues with a 2nd month visa extension hastened our leave after one night. The staff is incredible! It has an elevator.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
94,Great for the price,50,February 2017,"The service is great for its price.
The room was not so big, but it's comfy and clean. Everything in the room was good, wifi, air conditioner, hot shower, TV, toilet, water heater, etc worked perfectly. The pool was clean as well, even though it's not a big one. The staffs were really helpful and nice. Would love to go back in the future.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
95,Budget accomodation budget rates,30,February 2017,"Great customer service and very helpful staff.
Budget rates and budget facilities.
Deluxe room with double bed but no chairs or table to do paperwork.
A small kettle but no microwave, ironing table or iron.
Breakfast include and there is a choice of menus to choose from however if you are here for more than a week it lacks variety in its menu.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
96,Laid back Trip,50,February 2017,Awesome hotel and friendly staff.. I loved the enviroment. The hotel is next to small paddy field. Its like modern vs traditional. And the villas and hotels along the roads are beautiful too.. Bali style truly are one of the amazing arts i ever seen.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
97,Nice Hotel for a good price.,40,February 2017,"This hotel is clean, staff is friendly, rooms are small but the price is low compared to other places in that area. It's a good hotel for very reasonable prices. Motorbike rental here is little too expensive compared to other places.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
98,friendly staff but hotel rooms are dirty and smelly,10,October 2016,"The hotel rooms look nothing like the photos on tripadvisor. The rooms were dirty, with multiple black dirty handprints on the wall and stained curtains, as well as a musty smell and overall general unclean feeling. If you are looking for a cheap stay (eventually left to stay at another hotel that night) without much consideration for high quality rooms, comfort or the best cleanliness, then this is the place for you.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
99,Very good place,50,December 2016,Very clean and tidy rooms! The people here are very polite and nice! Great hotel! Highly recommended Dewi at D'Bale restaurant is lovely and very friendly and speaks very good English. Would stay again!,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
100,Cheap and a had a good service,40,January 2017,"Near any area at seminyak, hotel is quite good, service is nice, and the best is the hotel is not expensive haha, been here for 5 days and have no regret.

If someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the Sixties, that's his problem. Love and peace are eternal. -lennon",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
101,"Great stay, great hotel with a little of sidenotes.",50,December 2016,"First of all, the hotel was nice enough. Big room, clean, bathroom also clean, hygienic. The bedroom needs more light though, some part of the room is dark enough for you to not to be able to read i.e reading receipts for today's spending.

Also if you're staying on the 1st floor, occasionally there might be bugs that slips under the door gap. They gave me quite a shock sometimes.

The pool was nice, especially if you get a room on the 1st floor (it's right outside your window-door!), there's really nothing wrong with the pool really, I've used it a couple of times during my stay there, except the shape is long & narrow (2 person swimming side to side), so you cant really do proper swimming/workout if there are people (kids) playing in the pool with you.

The location of the hotel is quite far from local attractions, i.e: jl. Kayu Aya. You need transportations to get in/out. (You do not want to walk all the way there)

Hotel staffs were nice, and polite. But sometimes response time from room service can be quite long / or even unclear whether they can fulfill it or not.

Their breakfast is a breakfast we all want to forget. Taste was so-so (not great), food variations were not that great either. But hey, who wants to have breakfast at the hotel when you have cafes all around the area waiting to serve you good breakfast, right?

All-in-all, my stay here was good, i got a good deal for my money, and it's definitely a good place to crash & refresh yourself after a long & awesome day in the island of dreams.

Cheers. =)",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
102,Value for money,40,December 2016,"Great staff! They cater our nees quickly eventhought they are busy. Handling chinese group is a challenge but the manage to handle it professionaly.

The downside will be that they only provide 1 room key, that might be a little troublesome

Kudos goes to krisna for being so friendly during our stay

Overall, i recommend this hotel if you on thight budget",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
103,Quiet hotel great for getaway,40,January 2016,I went here with friends and the hotel was great. Located in the urban area and surrounded by paddy field. Good atmosphere for rest and quiet. I got good sleep here. The staffs were friendly. Not a big room but clean. The pool was in the middle of the hotel. I could see it from my room. Nice hotel.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
104,"Terrible horrible hotel, avoid at all costs...",20,December 2016,"This would be one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in, towels are filthy, rooms smell damp, very noisy inside the smallest hotel rooms I've stayed in ever, wifi doesn't work for more than 10 mins per hour - pool hours are 8am-8pm, however when children are screaming and swimming in the pool at 7am nobody does anything about it, last night there was a large group drunk swimming until 11pm.
Rooms are extremely small with 4 coat hangers in the wardrobe, no drawers, we are checking out 7 days early without being able to get a refund and will be checking into another hotel around the corner, I cannot stress enough - DO NOT STAY HERE unless you are paying $30 a night, this is all it's worth. Not the $100 a night we paid plus the $20 additional per night during high season.
They fogged the garden when we were in the room and the chemicals cane flooding in through the door- even though we had the doors shut. So no insulation - which would explain why you can and do hear everything that is happening outside in the pool. All rooms look over the pool so the noise echoes too. The reception is almost overlooking the pool so the staff and management just show they don't care about anything once they have your money.
Breakfast is below average so I wouldn't recommend it, and the restaurant dinner was also very average.
P.s. The first towels we had beside being dirty- one of them had drops of blood on it, the rest of the time the usual white towels are usually a greyish brown colour, if I was to guess all they do is dry them after use.
I mentioned all these items to the staff on check out so I do hope they listen to me as it could be quite a nice budget place to stay.
We have since checked into another hotel
""The Jambuluwuk ocean seminyak, which is great and will review shortly... but in short it's fantastic.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
105,Value for money,40,December 2016,"My sister and I stayed at the Alea in December for 7 nights, using a scoopon voucher. We had a pool access room. The hotel itself was very nice. There are 2 elevators (only one working). The hotel is only 2 years old, so clean and well looked after. There are 2 lap pools in the centre of the building. The rooftop lounge is very disappointing. The wooden tables and chairs have been ruined by the weather and the lounges are mouldy. These should all be replaced by weatherproof furniture. It would be nice if more pot plants were up there as well. The location is in a built up area, so you have to walk a distance to get anywhere. The road in front of the hotel has many potholes and difficult to walk on. It is about a kilometre from the beach and maybe 2 kilometres to Seminyak square. There is a shuttle from the hotel at 1000hrs, but no return one. It doesn't cost very much to return by taxi. The staff were all very nice and very friendly, especially Putu and Abdul in reception and Ade who is the food and beverage manager. The breakfast was ok, but the food was not hot. The drink and food menu prices are nett, but I think still slightly overpriced, even so. There is a happy hour from 3-6pm (buy 2 and get one free). There are restaurants fairly close by. The spa is very nice but as with all hotel spa's more expensive than outside. They did have a special on the Balinese massage A$17 for 1 hr. It may be worthwhile asking for a discount on other treatments.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
106,nice quiet place for a holiday,40,December 2016,"It was good that the rooms are non smoking. The rooms are smallish but adequate. The hotel is built in two parallel wings 4 stories high with two lap pools between. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast menu is changed daily, and the food is both tasty and plenty of it, but don't expect 5 star on a budget. The road in front of the hotel is in bad need of repair, but that is not the fault of the hotel. It is an easy walk to town where the shops are plentiful. I would stay here again if I came back to Bali.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
107,Very uncomfortable,10,December 2016,"I arrived at 5pm with my own car and when i went to the parking lot the space is very small, it was very hard to park my car by my self. Not far from me, there was a security but i saw him that phe was just sit and doing nothing while i was strugling with the parking with the parking thing.

Done with the parking thing then i went to the receptionist to do check in to my room. The staff was very nice. I like the lobby and the view of the pool from there.

Next, i get into the room and i was very shocked. I mean i know this is a budget hotel but of course i expect a clean comfortable place to sleep, that's why i prefer to rent a room at a hotel rather than a guest house. It's like they're never maintaining their hotels. I can see the paint of the wall start to cracking and the table also very dirty. The worse part is i can see black spots on the bed sheets and yellow spots on the pillow cover. It's like they're never changing the linen.

I called the receptionist and ask if it's possible to change into the new room but they said they will send someone to check room. I told the person who came into my room like it's very uncomfortable to sleep in a dirty room like this but she said she will send someone to clean up my room. I wait for half an hour at the lobby and after i came back, they literally only change the bed sheets while i can shee the table and the pillow cover still dirty.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
108,Great Holiday,40,December 2016,"Just got back today.
We bought a scoopon voucher for myself and my hubby for 10 nights in 2015, unfortunately all of the volcanic ash happened and we had to cancel our trip (we ended up in Vanuatu).
The hotel honoured our voucher and we were able to change the trip to be 2 rooms for 5 nights. We booked an additional 2 rooms at a great rate and ended up taking 9 people, kids, son in law and best friend for a total of 4 rooms.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, they accommodated our large group with no fuss and nothing was too much trouble. Abdul at the reception counter answered any question I had (and there were many) and organised some tours for us at a cheaper rate than anywhere else. Putu would have gladly taken our 6 year old for the day if that was required. The entire staff went out of their way for us for whatever the request was. The hotel was clean,, serviced daily, beds comfy, hot water, cold aircon in the rooms, wonderful food and extremely friendly staff. The breakfast buffet had a great selection of hot dishes, pancakes, muffins, croissants, cereal, tea, coffee and eggs however you liked them cooked.
We had massages and pedicures and the girls in the spa did a great job there as well. Great location as it is off the main drag so its quiet up only a 3 minute walk to Main Street.
I can't think of anything as a negative and would definitely stay there again with my family. Wonderful, wonderful people!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
109,Budget hotel,30,December 2016,"Nice budget hotel. Quiet location and clean. Staff couldn't be more helpful, they are what make this hotel. Breakfast is boring and the hotel caters to large bus loads of Chinese, who are rude, take over and are noisy and messy. The hot water doesn't always work but when it does its really nice and hot. I would stay here again if you are on a budget.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
110,nice spot,50,December 2016,"nice spot hotel in between rice paddy field, far away from busy noise in the street & nice price too but we didn't take with the breakfast. very close to Petitenget - Seminyak area, where's a lot of coffee shop into clubs. but quite warm into hot in lobby area cause the ceilings is too low i think.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
111,Great place to stay,50,November 2016,"Great place to stay with comfortable bed and super nice hot shower. The wifi works great and they have lovely little pool on the grounds too. The rooms air con didn't get super chilled but it was enough to keep you nice and cool as you slept.

The staff are friendly and speak good english.

The walk to the beach is through some dodgy looking alleyways but got there in about 10-15 mins.

If staying here there is tasty local restaurant called the luhron super tasty food and super cheap. Can get main and an iced tea for 25,000. It is o ly 2 minute walk from hotel. If you turn right out of hotel and then left down small dirt road it will be in on your left hand side 50 metres down the lane.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
112,Recommended!,40,October 2016,The hotel is simply a beatiful.the room are beatiful with comfortable and pool view.the wifi is well. Had great stay and would recommend to any one. Would definitely stay here again.sumply and amazing,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
113,Good value,40,November 2016,We visit this hotel recomended by kilroy in mid november. Very nice staff and good hotel regarding the cost. The pool area is almost empty so we had it for our selves :). We had a plesent stay. Extra much thanks to the girl in the reception who let us use her motorbike to the pharmacy when my girlfriend got sick.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
114,The right price for a holiday,40,November 2016,"The Alea Hotel is a 5 minute drive to the centre of Seminyak, Situated in a small street and quite area , but in walking distance to a great coffee shop, the Butchers café and a delightful gourmet deli. The opposite direction is a ten minute walk to the beach to sit and day dream or swim in the waves. The accommodation was great with two pools in the centre of the hotel. This hotel caters for a majority of chinese tourists, with a handful of other nationalities. The helpful and ever so friendly staff and cheap accommodation made for a lovely stay.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
115,Just another hotel really,30,October 2016,"Nothing special about this hotel. It's a room with a bed. The housekeeping needs to step up, the towels were grey, there was lipstick on the mugs in the room and dust everywhere. The pool is a joke, and nobody in his right mind would use that or the pool bar. Various descriptions of the hotel mention that ""the beach is a mere 5 minutes walk away"". Maybe if you run it at marathon speed, otherwise the walk is more 15-20 minutes. The location of this hotel is in the middle of a dead-end street.

Maybe the worst of it all, is that they seem to generate considerable a lot of revenue from Chinese tour groups... the loud and obnoxious kind.

Would not recommend to stay here.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
116,"Affordable Hotel, pleasantly surprised.",50,October 2016,"Two lap pools. Deluxe room comfortable, serviced daily by wonderful staff. Two free water daily. In room tea & coffee supplied. The Spa too expensive, good decor. Ade the restaurant manager was very helpful, his staff are respectful towards Ade and all tourists. Buffet breakfast, freshly made eggs served any way you like. Thank you",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
117,Good palace,50,October 2016,"Recommended hotel, near seminyak to bar club and beach. Enjoying stay here. Staff very friendly, cleaners hotel, price not expensive. Breakfast variant is good, but pool area is small. Thanks to all staff here.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
118,"Budget hotel, serves it's purpose.",40,October 2016,"stayed here for one week on. Scoopon deal for which we had paid very little. We got what we paid for. The staff are lovely, always smiling and happy to help. The pool never gets sun except for about one hour per day so you have to head to the beach, which is about a five minute walk away. Bring your own towel as the hotel don't allow you to take pool towels off the property. The rooms are not massive but clean and comfortable. The hotel caters to large groups of Chinese tourists who travel by the coach load and are rude and noisy (not the hotel's fault) and like a swarm of locust at breakfast. We had breakfast included but ate out several times for this reason. The hotel is in a great spot, you're only ten minutes walk from Metis, Merah Putih, Biku etc and a short taxi ride to the rest of Seminyak. There's also a daily shuttle service at 10am to Seminyak Square.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
119,Great stay,40,October 2016,"Paid a very cheap rate and stayed for 3 weeks. Nice new hotel with friendly staff and 2 great pools. Not far from potato head club with some nice restaurants near by like honey bee. On a quite lane so no traffic noise.
Walking to places in the heat can be a little too much so We hired a scooter for 35,000 (3.50 AUD)a day and went to a lot of places in Seminyak and cangu.
To sum it up we were near the beach for 25 AUD dollars a night included Buffett breakfast for 2
In a nice room the only down fall would be walking to place but nothing I could fault the hotel but if you didn't like this place you must be extremely fussy and should be in Nusa dua",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
120,Bali Holiday,50,October 2016,We are enjoying our stay very much. BBQ Night on Friday nights is good - all you can eat. Had a lovely massage. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff. Everyone is so very friendly and they can't do enough for you to make sure your time with them is both relaxing and enjoyable.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
121,"Decent Hotel, Warm Hospitality",40,September 2016,"I arrived at the hotel late at night around 10 pm as I had other places to go to that day.
On the way to the location we had to call the hotel for direction as we passed the street to the hotel a couple of times. I already knew it was not located on the main street but I was having slight problem locating the hotel using the google map.
As I got to the hotel, the staff did a breeze check in and led me to my room right away.
The room was as expected, appropriately small but felt enough for me as I travelled alone. The room and the bathroom was clean but the lighting was rather dim for my taste. The amenities were pretty standard: 2 medium sized bottles of mineral water, tea and coffee, hanger, towels.
A hairdryer provided in the room would have been nice, though :)

My room was on the 2nd floor with a pool view. The view to the pool and the size of the pool itself were just as seen in pictures.
I didnt try the breakfast as I booked the room with breakfast excluded.
The next day I checked out around 10am. Again the check out was easy and the staff was friendly in asking me how my stay was and in offering to help me with my luggage.
I chose this hotel because the hotel rate was modest and was in the seminyak area where i needed to do my business in.
In case you didnt book the hotel room with breakfast, you wouldnt need to worry as there's plenty restaurants and cafes you can choose within walking distance to the main street.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
122,Most memorable,50,October 2016,I would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff at The Alea Hotel for all their help. They were very welcoming and friendly. Thank you to Abdoel for going out of his way to rescue my bank card from Kuta (My Superman) 👍Rooms were tidy and perfect for busy travellers. Breakfast and dinner menu amazing. I highly recommend The Alea as they go the extra mile to help their visitors. See you again soon 😁😚✌✌,The Alea Hotel Seminyak

126,Affordable,30,May 2016,Stayed here for a night during a business trip. Room was small. Basic amenities provided. All I could remember was that the hotel had a hot and stuffy ambience. Perhaps of my room's position on the west block. I do remember that they have electric plugs conveniently located by the bed. Perfect for peoplw like me who sleep with their gadgets,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
127,Best bang for your buck!,40,September 2016,"Great location, helpful awesome staff and fantastic room and pool.
Was perfect for my stay at Bali.

It's near to Potato beach club, Butcher house, The Holy Crab, La Favela and many other attractions.

Clean room and a comfy bed.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
128,Clean Budget accommodation,30,August 2016,"I stayed at the Alea hotel for 10 nights with a scoopon voucher. Great value but you get what you pay for. The room was clean but there were plumbing issues in my room. The toilet stopped filling up with water which they fixed quickly. The shower after a few days only had boiling hot water which made it impossible to shower. They could not fix this so I was offered a room change. There were no more plumbing issues in he room but a little bit of mound in the bathroom.

With the scoopon deal you get vouchers for meals, drinks and massage. The vouchers for the meals do not cover the normal menu and there is a second menu for the vouchers. There were 4 choices on this menu and again it was a complimentary meal so the expectations were not hi.

Clean hotel with friendly staff. Walking distance to supermarkets, restaurants and bars. Complimentary shuttle bus into seminyak. I always hire a motorbike which they arranged a good price so location was not a problem.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
129,Clean rooms and friendly staff,40,August 2016,"Stayed here for 7 nights. Rooms were clean, staff were friendly.
Breakfast was great, lots of variety and really tasty.
Evening meals - we had 1 a la carte meal - ok but not great
Joined the Friday night BBQ another night, this was better

Room was clean and well maintained
Staff were friendly. Only issue was they forgot to organise return trip to airport for departure. Luckily I was confirming return details that morning so they arranged something straight away so we didn't miss our flight.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
130,Cheap but not cheerful.,20,September 2016,"We stayed at the Alea hotel for 4 nights before moving onto a homestay in ubud. Staff were very friendly but unfortunately we had problems with the showers twice. The first shower incident there was no pressure and cold water. We had to walk through the restaurant in our towels to shower in another room. The second incident pressure was ok but water was cold. I don't expect a lot from a 3 star but I do expect a hot shower. Breakfast was average. Duvet covers and sheets were not white and looked dirty, there was a whole in the duvet cover. I respected the management team a lot as when I complained about the showers they refunded us for our breakfast as this was not included. Overall I would stay somewhere else next time in seminyak closer to beach and I would not reccomend this hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
131,Loved this Alea Hote.,50,July 2016,My friend and i stayed here on a scoopon voucher . After reading some of the negative reviews we were a little worried but i can truely say that everything was perfect . Yes the room was a little small but very clean and comfortable and we didnt spend much time in the room anyway. The stuff was always very helpful the massage at the hotel was the best and we very much enjoyed breakfast. We will definitely visit again .,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
132,Holiday,20,July 2016,Great airport transfers very small rooms but comfortable beds ... food not the best but the paw paw at breakfast was yum...and the omlettes. ..The pools are in the shade so not much sun and when we were there the first pool was out of order..we had a pool access room next to the out of order pool..There is 2 seats around each pool so silly..no seating. Staff were nice but we weren't to happy when they brought a guy back to our room from the sports bar up the road... accusing us of not paying our bill! We didn't fall for that one and was surprised the motel security let them in breaching our privacy ...be careful with that maybe some sort of scam going on between the two...otherwise good cheap place to stay and good walking distance to the beach.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak

134,Great Stay,40,August 2016,"I came to Alea Hotel with my friends and stayed for 2 nights here. I booked the hotel via pegipegi.com and its quite cheap (using a credit card promotion) and get approx. $15 or IDR 210k per night.

Its located almost at the end of the Cendrawasih road, and its very quiet at night.
The staffs are very kind and helpful. The room was nice, clean, quite small and has a ""small sofa"" beside the window. I guess there is no connecting room here, because when i requested for connecting room, they said we don't have (i dont know whether there is no available connecting room on that day or they really dont have any) . Aircon worked really well, same as the hot water. They have a parking lot, both car and motorcycle.

Overall, nice stay and great value of money !",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
135,Very value for money,30,August 2016,"I came to the Alea Hotel for my husband birthday vacation. Couple days before I called them to made a surprise welcome when we checking in.

And they did it! Thanks Alea!!

Pros:
-New hotel,
-Location is near Seminyak center,
-Modern building,
-The rate is value for money,
-Service are excellent
-Staffs are helpfull
-Pools are awesome!

Contras:
-Breakfast menus quiet boring
-Shower are weak
-When visitor talk or laugh so loud in the swimming pool area, u can hear them in your room..it's quiet annoying.

Anyway, this hotel could be our choice when we come back to Seminyak area.
Thanks Alea :)",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
136,Scoopon Deal,40,August 2016,"We purchased a Scoopon deal for only $300 or thereabouts for 7 nights. If this deal is the difference between you coming to Bali or not, then its definitely worth taking the deal.

We read a lot of the reviews here prior, and they're pretty spot on. It is out of the way but nothing a quick taxi ride doesn't fix, or a 20 min walk. The breakfast could cater a bit more for Westerners (read Aussies!) but if its included, its a meal to start the day, but don't expect an Aussie quality brekky. The dinner meals were surprisingly ok too!!

The rooms are small, but clean and tidy enough. The bed is comfortable and the pillows are decent enough. I have slept on worse in Australia that's for sure! More importantly there are clean towels and clean sheets and good housekeeping.

The pool is exactly like the website - could do with more day beds/lounges, but we didn't mind that they weren't in full sun all day - didn't fancy sunburn!! Photo attached is my own so you can see its as described.

The staff are really friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Do yourself a favour and use the welcome massage voucher at Alea... its amazing - better than on the streets.

Dewi in the pool bar area gets a special mention for her cocktail making...they were very good and she was very attentive!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
137,Wonderful experience with fabulous staff.,40,August 2016,My first trip to Bali and what a wonderful experience. I stayed there for 7 nights and the staff made it all worthwhile. The hotel was clean and the food was very nice. The staff were exceptionally friendly and so easy to get along with. They have a shuttle bus that goes to Seminyak Square every day. I would go back because the staff were fabulous.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
138,You Get What you Pay for.,30,August 2016,"We stayed at the Alea for 10 days on a Scoopon Deal.
Paid to upgrade to a poolside room as all other rooms have no balcony.
The advantages are.-
Low Cost
As part of the deal included is Breakfast,Two either evening or lunch meals,two half hour massages each and afternoon tea
Staff perhaps their greatest asset.
Disadvantages.
Rooms are small and basic
A bit remote from the main areas 10 minute walk to beach through alleyways.
Meals particularly breakfast very basic
Lack of poolside seating.
Pools small and cool due to lack of sunlight.

In saying that we enjoyed our stay knowing what to expect so if you are thinking of going to this hotel be aware it is a budget Hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
139,Great stay!,50,July 2016,"When we arrived in Bali for the first time we searched a budget hotel and we found this one. It's a very nice, beautiful, clean hotel with two swimming pools in the middle. There is no sunshine at the swimming pool. We left after four days and later we came back because it's such a great place to stay. It is close to the beach as well!
The second time we were there my boyfriend got sick (dengue fever) and the staff helped us so good!

But i dont know why when i stay at this hotel im so dispoint, room so small and moist. The worst thing was the bathroom, shower leaked and made the bathroom becomes muddy. I told about the bathroom and they not reponse.. thats why im so dispointed.

We took a standard room. It was quite small but very compact, nicely furnished, had a lot of shelves and useful surfaces so we could arrange our staff easily.

Hosekeeping:
Rooms were cleaned daily and thoroughly. And they made the most amazing towel swans upon our arrival.

Swimming pool:
Was the only disappointment we faced with in this hotel. The water in the pool was dirty, we gave another try couple of days after - same story - dirty!

Staff:
My warmest regards to the security guards in the parking area. They were always friendly, fun and helpful. Even the front office guys were not that good so far.

Warning:
It is not related to the Alea hotel but I want to share it with hotel's guests or whoever will read this review. There is a laundry shop like 400m away from the hotel. It will be on your left hand side when you exit the hotel and move towards Petitenget street. They offer the same day service. So do not go there! They messed up all my clothes with dark stains plus everything had very chemical odour! I strongly suggest to search for a better place or use the hotel's laundry service.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
142,Alea Hotel Review,40,August 2016,"My partner and I stayed at the Alea hotel for ten nights on a scoopon deal.
After reading a few reviews I was expecting a few hiccups in regards to breakfast options and pool use. However, I was completely surprised. The breakfast was delicious and stocked up frequently. Our room, although small, was perfect for the two of us. The bed was so comfortable and I slept well every single night. We had no problems with aircon or water and the shower was divine!
All the staff were lovely and often remembered my name and room number when ordering taxis or just saying hello.
For the price you pay - this hotel is fabulous.
Walking to the beach is only a short 10 minute stroll through alleyways. This road is often quiet as not much traffic can move through.
Alea offer a free Seminyak Shuttle that takes you into Seminyak Square every day at 10am. We used this service most days as it was convenient and we saved money on taxis.
Food recommendations: Ultimo Restaurant is a must do, divine Italian food, free breadsticks and cheap prices (approx 300,000 for two adults!!)
Shopping: for Bali, Seminyak is definitely more upmarket so be prepared for higher prices. We had difficulty haggling in Seminyak so did most of our market shopping in Kuta/Legian

The only advice I have is to order a taxi to the lobby for pick up (rather than wait on a busy street corner) - as most of the journeys you take to Legian or Kuta will cover the 30,000 rupiah flag fall.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
143,Seriously loved it,50,June 2016,"This hotel is amazing for the price and has quite a nice pool, not to mention pretty close to the beach. The rooms are clean, the showers are nice (hot water worked great with the exception of an occasional fluctuation in temp, which was no biggie at all), and the bidet toilets blew my mind lol.

They also offer complimentary coffee, tea, and bottled water which was awesome. There is a scooter rental place up the road from the hotel, which is a tad bit pricier than other places but when you consider the money exchange rate, it was a great price and you have the convenience of being close enough to drop it off and walk back to your room.

The best part of this place though is definitely the staff, they were beyond helpful and so insanely kind. From the start a young gentleman at the front desk helped me with my bag (I wish I could remember his name) and was kind enough later on to drive me to a beach club the following day when he was off of work.

There was also a group of amazing people working in the bar/restaurant area who kept me company and helped me learn their language when I was the only one in there haha (the restaurant/bar is usually pretty quiet). Their customer service was nothing short of perfect.

Thank you Dewi, Adi, Anik, and young gentleman at the front desk. You all made my trip a million times better<3",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
144,"Nice hotel in ""hidden"" location",40,July 2016,"Excellent for such a price... I stayed for 2 nights...

- Cleanliness : 4.5/5, hotel room and public area are clean and spoiled my eyes.
- Service : 4.8/5, quick service during service, nice hospitality
- Location : 3/5, a little bit hidden, you need to walk a bit with messy stoney road to get into hotel from Jalan Petitenget. Quite dark at night too. if you're not comfortable with dogs, better to find a place that closer to the main road. I don't have problem with it so, no big deal.
- Comfort : 3.5/5, it was ok for the first night. Then at the 2nd night there was a group guests checked in late at night and it was noise when they passed the corridor. No noise reducer for it. And the drop for the shower gel was waaayy tooo small, needs huge effort and time to have it in your hand...
- Meal : --/-- can't say anything about it. I'm not kind of hotel food lover, i prefer to go out and try lotsa things new. But, if i look at the menu, they look interesting.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
145,Lovely hotel,50,July 2016,"Booked a week in this hotel following 9 or so months in hostels so wanted something a bit nicer. Very pleased with this hotel, clean and tidy, extremely friendly and helpful staff, beds/towels changed everyday, able to call for anything you need. In a great location midway between the main street and the beach. Access to the beach is a little unusual as you have to walk down an alleyway and through a sort of building yard however it seems this is quite usual and didn't bother us at all. The only downside for me is that the food was fairly expensive (hotel prices) and not very good. Tip: Visit the beachfront restaurant at the end of the alley, called the something Cantina. Gorgeous food and very cheap!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
146,Nice friendly staff but nit giid for small children,30,July 2016,"Staff were lovely, friendly & very helpful. Nice enough hotel but personaly didn't feel it it accomodated families as the pool area was small as it was situated right in the middle of the hotel so each room looked down onto the pool and it only had 8 loungers (2 at each end of the pool). Also didn't like the fact that the wash basin was in the hotel room rather than in the bathroom area & that all toilet paper had to be placed in a bin rather than being flushed away.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
147,Dont judge by the pictures you see,20,July 2016,"Bought a ten night package through Scoupon, yes it was cheap and included breakfast, but you still need to be able to use the pool and eat the meals. Pool not working, not enough seats to sit around anyway. Food was two minute noodles for dinner ( I can get this at home). Staff were very apologetic when we left after one night.
The bedrooms are very small not enough room to swing a cat, very claustrophobic.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
148,Exceptional value for money,50,July 2016,"this is a nice little budget hotel with lovely staff and adequate facilities. Breakfast was fine and other food options all good value. Service is great and staff speak good English. While it seems a little out of the way, there is access to the beach about a 10 minute stroll away that takes you out right next to the W. plenty of dining options in close proximity too. While there is a pool, it's more useful for exercise than for lounging next to - sun beds have no cushions and the pool is in the shade all day. at least you don't need umbrellas!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
149,First scoopon deal that hasn't been A1 but you get what you pay this was cheap,20,July 2016,"Not a hotel for us, small rooms nowhere to sit outside if you don't get to the 8 lilo's that are available. You could not even enjoy sitting in your room to relax so small. THe hotel requires lots of maintenance and truly just taking care of the whole building. If you are going out all day and just using it as a sleep room okay! other than that pay a bit more.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
150,"Great value, lovely staff!",40,July 2016,"My sister and I stayed for a week on a Scoopon deal and were pleasantly surprised.
The rooms were small but very clean, good air con, comfortable beds and ours opened out to the pool which was very handy. Sadly, the 2 pools do only get a few hours of sun because of their position.
Breakfasts were included in the deal and they were lovely. Pretty much the same things on offer every morning but plenty of choice; omelettes, hot food, fruit, toast, juices and coffee and tea. Great service by the staff, always friendly polite and helpful.
The hotel was a short walk to one end of Petitenget St. for basic shops, and about a 30 min walk into Seminyak Square (which we loved doing every day to burn off the great food and drink!) but a $3 taxi ride is always available.
Head the other direction out of the hotel and it's a 5 min walk to the beach. Turn left along the beach and you'll walk passed all the expensive places like W, Ku de ta, Potato Head etc.
We had a great week of delicious food, drinks, loads of walking, shopping and made great connections with the friendly staff.
I'd particularly like to thank Ade, Ricco, Lisna, Linda, Mila and Putra. All staff were friendly and helpful but these are the names I remember :)",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
151,pretty rad for the price ☆,40,July 2016,"I found a room on Agoda for $20. It was clean, view of the pool, free wifi. Walking distance from most useful things in Seminyak. Don't get the hotel to pick you up from the airport, or anywhere really, they're a rip off. Other than that, can't hate! Got exactly what I expected for a one night stop over.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
152,Great Holiday,50,June 2016,"I spent 10 wonderful days at the Alea in June. Travelling with a friend we had pool access rooms next door to each other, such a treat to step out into the pool. The staff were all amazing, friendly, helpful and polite. A special shout out to ""Miss Putu"" who was such a delight, made our check in very special. Breakfast was great, enough food European and Asian options which is to be expected as we were in Asia, I did not go to Bali for a full english breakfast each day & loved having Nasi goreng for breakfast for a change and when in Rome! Everything you need is within walking distance or cheap enough in a taxi. great stay, great little hotel, Thank you to everyone at the Alea :-)",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
153,A nice little hotel,40,July 2016,"We loved staying here and decided to extend from one night to five! The room is not too spacious, yet the huge window and the pool view is charming. Interior is very clean and bathroom has nice rainshower with separate detachable shower head (good to have if you're staying with little children and need to wash them!).

We love how they gave us extra keycard and our room was already cool when we arrived. The housekeeping staff is friendly and very good, they clean thoroughly every morning, change the towels, top-up the bottled water & amenities.

They have two long pools. Both are rather for bigger children because they don't have dipping pool for babies/toddlers. As for the parking space, it was never a problem because they provide valet service.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
154,"Perfect location, price and service.",50,July 2016,"Located in center Seminyak, near popular beach club 'Patato head'. 15 min walk away from beach. Nice and quiet area, with a lot of nice restaurant in any kind.

Hotel is super clean with really helpful staff. The service is really fast.

They have a awesome swimming pool on the ground floor. Right in the center of the complex.

And great value for money. They have some pretty sick offers.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
155,Quite far from shops and eateries,30,July 2016,"The location is quite remote, but the hotel is very nice. The rooms are quite small, but very clean and simple. The tv channels were good we were able to watch the AFL from our room and didn't have to go to a sports bar. We bought the deal on scoopon which gave us a good deal, it included breakfast everyday, 1 dinner and 1 massage each. They do the free transfers to and from the airport which is great.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
156,So recommended!,50,July 2016,"What a great place to run away from Denpasar's crowd! I stayed 1 night and wish I could stay longer. The room was so simple, minimalist, private, and comfortable. Truly worth the price!
The wifi was kinda slow, anyway. The staff was so kind and helpful. I got twin bed in my room but they made it into one bed. Really want to come back soon!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
157,Really nice hotel,40,June 2016,"My friend and I spent 2 nights here and really enjoyed it. We paid for their airport pick up which was definitely worth it as we arrived in the evening and the hotel is difficult to find. The staff were very friendly and helpful! The room was a good size, very clean and the bathroom was fab. I booked a twin room and we were given a double, I was too tired to be bothered moving but I have no doubt they would have moved us had we mentioned it. The hotel has 2 pools side by side which are lovely. Not much sun as they are in a courtyard but a nice place to chill. Only 8 sunloungers though! You can walk to the beach and some restaurants very easily which was nice. They charge quite a lot to rent a motorbike so we rented one somewhere else and they let us park it there for free. Staff were great and called us a taxi when we left. Would stay again!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
158,Inexpensive and clean,40,June 2016,"Bought on scoopons a great deal 2 rooms (4 guests total) inc daily breakfast, 1 dinner ea, 1 massage ea, free airport transfers, free soft drinks and water each morning in mini bar. Even though the rooms were small the staff made it a worthwhile stay, they were sooo friendly and polite. This hotel was very clean and our rooms were serviced every day as we put the maid sign on the door each morning. The 2 pools are large enough and were cleaned day and night , our initial concern was that they would be in the shade most of the day but it was so bloody hot it didn't matter in fact it was a relief that it was shaded. Value for money and the staff definitely make a difference.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
159,Holiday trip,40,July 2016,"Nice n convenience hotel keep the price affordable ok
I got only 200k rupiah from traveling
Thanks traveling n alea
Big pools near seminyak area n beaches
But my 1st room there's a lot of ant very annoyed
Over all it's good n worthy I spend 2night here",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
160,Clean and friendly,40,June 2016,"Hotel has been very clean, comfortable bed and pillows. Staff go out of there way to be helpful and extremely friendly. Food has been good. Ade and his staff have been lovely. Highly recommend the signature massage. Very relaxing. Thank you",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
161,The staff make the difference,40,June 2016,"I recently stayed at the Alea on a Scoopon deal. The hotel room and amenities met my expectations. The rooms are rather small, but clean and comfortable. The hotel is in a great location and not too far from the beach and other dining establishments.

The standout at this hotel is the staff. The staff go out of their way to accommodate your every need. From first checking in, to when you finally leave the staff are there to help. A special mention must be made of Dewi who works in the restaurant. Each morning she would greet us with her friendly smile. Nothing was too much for her. The attention she gave us, and other guests, is one of the reasons we will return. Thanks Dewi!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
162,"The Alea Hotel, Seminyak",50,June 2016,"From the moment my wife (Linda) and myself (Robert) were picked up by the free Alea Hotel shuttle at Denpasar airport; we received marvellous treatment.
We found ALL the staff (too numerous to mention) treated us with courtesy and friendliness.
This was a Scoopon deal which included a main meal and free daily breakfast and a massage.
The hotel is situated about a five minute walk to numerous shops, cafes and restaurants.
The Alea also has a very good restaurant; so it's not necessary to eat elsewhere if you don't feel inclined.
Facilities include a small kiosk (for drinks and nobblies), swimming pools, airconditioning in rooms, ensuite bathroom, free wifi, Friday barbeque night, happy hour drinks.
The Alea has a free shuttle at 10am to take guests to Seminyak Square (a larger shopping complex).
As I said ALL the staff treated us very well.
There is a picture of us with the Food and Beverage Manager in the middle (Ade is his name). He has a great sense of humour ... and can speak a little Italian.
Another picture is with Linda (Guest Relations Officer), Adhi (Sales Manager) in the middle and Rico the young trainee.
When we first checked in we were greeted by Linda. She just can't do enough for you. She is great. We only met Adhi briefly but concluded he is a very nice fellow. As for Rico; he has a passion for the hospitality industry and is a very nice helpful fellow.
Another is with Inda a waitress in the restaurant, she looked after us with the meals and drinks as did Sri who was great but unfortunately have no photo of her. As I said everyone will look after you if you go to the Alea Hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
163,Be Careful,10,June 2016,"Our holiday was spoilt when we came back to our cleaned room with our safe door open & some Rp taken from our purse in safe. Take note of what amount of money & things you put in safe. Not safe in safe!
Do not use hotels drivers, the one they gave to us to take us up to Lovina for the day, arrived late, didn't know where he was going & drove too fast & a big lack of communication.
Food was very ordinary for breakfast, rooms were clean with good beds & pillows.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
164,Wonderful Week in Bali,50,June 2016,"We stayed in the Alea Hotel on a scoopon deal & had a wonderful stay. The staff were so helpful & could not do enough for us. It was my husbands birthday while we were there & surprised him with a birthday cake. The rooms were small but very comfortable. For a budget holiday this is the place to stay. Easy walk to lots of amazing restaurants & shopping & a good reputable money changer. Linda & Buta on reception helped us book some amazing adventures & they were the best, thank you ladies.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
165,Peaceful,50,June 2016,"Location : secluded in the edge of seminyak area. Need motorbike to go to beach / other places, very quiet you mau get sleeping beauty here.

Room : not too big for two people, but bathroom quite big. The sink is outside not inside the bathroom, room is clean although the air con is hot. I've set it at 16 but still hot, perhaps because the temperature outside but that shouldn't be the factor tho if the aircons not broken.

Hotel: very nice! The lobby is big, wide open space. They have pool on the first floor but i didnt manage to dip in there.

Staff: all staffs works real good, they always smile and greet the guest even the housekeeper do a really good job. Security also very friendly to locals/foreigners.

Conclusion : i would love to go back to this hotel. This is very affordable place for that price. I love the secluded location, very peaceful and quiet if you would have a break from the cities. Near the hotel there is warung kita ( chinese food) also good place and cheap price. If you grab a coffee, try pison coffee not too far from the hotel. This hotel is the best place to stay for family and couples. I would definitely going back again.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
166,Faulty Towers with 30 Manuels,20,June 2016,"Firstly let me say that at $50 per night per room it was great value. This included transfers to and fron airport . Daily breakfast. 4 massages. 2 dinners.
The rooms are very small but clean. The shower is hot and good water pressure. The toilet has a bidet which is a great bonus ( helps with Bali belly clean ups). The pool is in shade so it never gets too hot and hardly anyone uses it. This was good for us as we used it all the time. The air conditioner work very well.
The staff are friendly but their lack of English is a problem at times.
My recommendation would be to never stay more than 5 days. We stayed 10 and the last 5 really tried our patience. The breakfasts become boring and we chose to eat out after that. The complimentary dinners are just ok. We only ate 1. Too many fabulous restaurants to try. If you are looking for budget then this it for you.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
167,Good Value & Awesome Stay,50,June 2016,"I have stay here for only 1 night but really satisfied. Our room was near to Lobby little bit pool view and it was so comfy and clean. Breakfast is delicious and staff at the Restaurant is really nice, view from Restaurant are the best, like it. Over all was perfect but the Channel TV has problem when we are arrived and the staff already fixed with prompt action, but in the next day at 10.00 AM the Channel start problem again. I really recommended this Hotel for our next trip...see ya and thank you.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
168,"Amazing stay, totally impressed!",50,June 2016,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Alea for 7 nights and really enjoyed our stay. We got picked up by a friendly driver from the airport and greated by 2 lovely girls at reception.
The hotel is very clean and things seem to be all brand new.
The bed is comfy and the sheets smell nice and clean.
When I asked for extra towels and coat hangers, they delivered within 2 minutes with a big smile.
The food is yummy... the fish with creamy source, mashed potatoes and veg was just delicious!
We stayed at this hotel and another 4 star hotel in Seminyak (which we have paid double the price for), but both my boyfriend and I much preferred our stay at Alea!
This should really be the true 4/5 star hotel!
Thanks all the friendly staff for the enjoyable stay! 👍👍",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
169,Fantastic staff!,40,April 2016,"We purchased a scoupon for our stay that was such good value no one believed we could have a family holiday in Bali for so little. We would definitely return to the Alea hotel, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, they left us feeling like nothing was too much to ask. The hotel itself is clean and beautiful, the rooms small but well set out with very comfortable beds. The swimming pool did not have much 'lounging aroound' space, but was perfect for a late afternoon dip and we didn't hang around the hotel during the day anyway. The hotel food was pretty average but there are plenty of cheap food options within a very short walking distance. we especially recommend the little bakery a few meters down the road, delicious chocolate filled buns for 50 australian cents and the cheapest bottled water we found! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Alea hotel and would definately recommend it for a good value, beautiful place to stay with helpful and friendly staff.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
170,Great Budget Hotel with Simplicity and Comfort,40,May 2016,"I stayed in The Alea Hotel from April 30 - May 6, 2016.

The hotel is not really big, located in Seminyak area (which is crowded) but around the hotel, you won't be disturbed by the crowd.
The staffs are friendly and helpful. They help us to arrange everything like airport transfer, tour, and so on.
The meeting room is also convenient. It is quite clean with standard audio and sufficient for 30-50 person.

I really enjoyed spent my time at the poolside but unfortunately, the operational hours is only until 10 pm.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
171,Very disappointed,10,May 2016,"We arrived at the hotel at 8pm expecting out rooms to be made up, but obviously it had not been cleaned since the previous guests. After waiting for the rooms to be cleaned we also noticed the covers were stained as well as sheets. The staff were very prompt on changing the linen. Another thing we had no hot water for the first night and the floors were covered in dirt.
As a budget hotel we didn't expect anything fancy but at least clean rooms. The buffet breakfast was nice enough to get you through the day.
As for location, it is in a reasonable location though a taxi is requires especially at night.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
172,Great hotel very helpful staff. Highly recommend,50,May 2016,We got this off scoopon the rooms were a bit smaller then they appear in the photos but overall GREAT hotel. Very helpful staff who were really accomodating when me and my partner were sick. They helped make us ginger teas that we were so so grateful for. The pool is lovely and clean- and beautiful site at night. The food at buffet breakfast is also pretty cool. The value is great for the price we paid THANK YOU ALEA we will be back!!,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
173,Great Budget Hotel!,40,April 2016,"We've just returned from our holiday in Bali, we purchased this hotel as a scoopon deal and found it to be a great little spot. We only paid $299 for 7 nights so it was a steal really!
The hotel is situated in a very good location close to busy parts of Seminyak, yet off the busy main roads down a smaller much quieter street, it's between 2 rice fields so it's very quite!
The staff were lovely and friendly however could improve on service, slightly slow, we would request water or towels to our room and sometimes had to wait or call again to ask, even though the hotel seemed very quite while we were there.
The rooms were fair, clean, nice, nothing fancy and not overly big, but big enough and comfortable enough for our stay.
The breakfast is ok, not great, but it is a budget hotel. Room service food and dinner menu is again ok but not great, so many other amazing restaurants near by though that you could eat at.
The pool was lovely, very picturesque, however tended to be cold as does not get enough sun, otherwise it was fine.
Overall this was a great little hotel for the price! Recommend for a budget stay in Seminyak that is close to everything!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
174,leisure family trip,50,March 2016,"the experience of our 5 day stay was awesome, great service, friendly staff, good maintenance, good food(not many options for vegetarians though), price included the airport return transfer, daily brekkie, one dinner n welcome drink with free wifi",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

We were very surprised with the quality of the hotel and value for money.Transfers to and from the airport were perfect. Great friendly staff, very clean room, great massage/spa, good quite location, child friendly, good breakfast, the complimentary shuttle to seminyak square daily was also handy if you don't hire a scooter. The only thing we could fault about the hotel was the limited sun exposure in the pool area, with about 30min of sun all day due to the buildings either side. All in all we were very happy with our stay and would definitely recommend visiting the alea seminyak.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
176,Staff was awesome hotel very clean and very helpful and friendly staff,50,April 2016,"Came to this hotel with friends and spent 7days there.Had a room ground floor close to the pool which was very handy.Aircon,safe were great room was very clean and staff were ever so helpful from reception,kitchen, cleaners I was so impress with all of them .Nothing was a issue when you needed anything from them and there service was 24/7 was so nice to get that services .Hotel was situated in a great location close to shops but the street from the hotel needs a bit more lights at night found it a bit dim along the road.Through Scroopon deals was great I would recommend Alea Seminyak Hotel had a awesome time while there.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
177,Good small hotel,30,April 2016,"Nice small hotel with great staff. We had a pool side room which was a must. Pool lacks seating however and only see the sun for a couple of hours.
They do need to learn that little things matter like 2 glasses for the room for 2 people not one. Have more information about the hotel in the room like Spa prices and services, pool hours etc.
Our room had terrible TV reception which they did try to fix but were unsuccessful. WiFi was not a problem and always worked well.
Breakfast is ok but not great. More Asian style than Western. The egg station was very slow at doing orders but omelettes where good when you eventually get them.
Good value purchased on a scoopon and location is good for being in the Seminyak area.
BTW the little bakery just down the road from the hotel sells beer and softdrink cheaper than the supermarket and Circle K.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

Pro's
Linda and Putu at front desk as well the staff at spa go out of their way for you and are the hidden gems at this hotel. Other staff good to. Only one of the waiters at tea had trouble with English.
Very quite at night .
Airport return easily arranged.
Bed comfortable room bit small .
Con's
Breakfast same every morning but cooked ok .
Tea menu small and not cooked very well or cheap for Bali prices . Ate out 5 of the 7 nights.
More loungers and or bean bags at pool area would be great ,just set loungers across ways instead of long could fit more in .
Make arrangements with local restuarants for diners to be picked up as I know other hotels in Bali do...",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
179,Perfect location and affordable hotel,40,November 2015,"Been there with my friends for 5 days. In overall, we're satisfied with the facilities and services. The staff are very friendly and soooo helpful. They make sure all things are fine in our side. Though, several times the light went out due to electricity cut off. But they handled this immediately. The location that near to every unique and nightlife places makes me consider to visit back this hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
180,Wonderful resort!,40,March 2016,"My friend and I stayed here using a Scoopon deal. We loved it. The food was fairly average but the staff are amazing and so helpful, especially Prju (sorry-think I spelt that wrong!) in reception. It's about a 30 min walk to Seminyak Square. It's located down a small street in between 2 rice fields and is so quiet at night. The thai restaurant around the corner in petitenget street is delicious!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

Only one shuttle to sem and must fine own way back. resturants along stroll up the street only problem at night a bit dark
We have been told manament is looking in to improving things
Breakfast is ok no bacon or western dishes but tasty
Only down side to this place is the resturant food apealling to eye but it seemed to be micowave and over cooked
Rather eat noodle out of can",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
182,Scoopon deal. Would I pay $50 a night. I am afraid not.,30,March 2016,"Got the deal on Scoopon and yes it was a bargain. We were picked up from the Airport and traveled way past Seminyak Square, which is no big deal as Seminyak is so big. The road to the 2 year old hotel was 100 years old. The hotel is nice. That's all. Small rooms which are adequate so no complaints. There was a seat under the TV which I turfed outside so my suitcase would fit in the room. The two pools were terrific and we enjoyed them each day with our little boy. Downside is there are only 8 sun beds. The buffet breakfast was a disaster and lucky I am happy with eggs and lots of fruit. The lack of selection was pitiful. Cleaning of the rooms was poor and on two occasions we had to call reception to get the room cleaned. Staff are lovely and try their best. Only one daily shuttle to Seminyak square where other hotels were offering shuttles all day long. For the price we paid and what we got I have no complaints but as I said would I pay (even) $50 a night. Sadly no.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
183,Value for Money - Pleasant Stay,40,March 2016,"We also purchased a deal through scoopon. I feel it was value for money, $40 (aus) gets you a comfortable, air conditioned room, with TV, comfortable bed and daily maid service. Irons and hairdryers are available form reception. Although I think best to bring your own hairdryer as the hotel ones are very slow. Breakfast was fine for us and was included in the $40 fee. Sometimes we had noodles, or rice, fish, chicken. There was a chicken porridge and you could also make up an asian soup. There was a chef that would cook you eggs any way. I also liked the mini pancakes which go quickly but as with everything you can request more. It does get busy at certain times but breakfast runs from 7 am to 11 am so plenty of time. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Any request I had was dealt with straight away. All in all I think you get value for money. I would say it is a 3 star hotel. In Ubud we stayed in 4 star hotel but we paid $108 a night so I expected more. If you are on a budget or looking for cheaper accommodation I think the Alea does a good job. Yes when you are having a shower there is a smell from the drains, but it's a hot country and I have experienced that in other hotels in other hot countries so it was not a big deal. Feedback for the Alea would be recover the sofas in the restaurant, light colour does not work and so looks tired and dirty. Wash restaurant floor regularly. Maybe a bit of tidy up were furniture has been chipped/scratched. Other than that I cannot complain it is value for money.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
184,Surprising gem,40,March 2016,"First time trip to bali and booked into this hotel on a Scoopon voucher deal. Wasn't sure what to expect, but this place has provided a very enjoyable place to stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff are super friendly and willing to help you with all requests, the massages are wonderful way to de-stress and the atmosphere is laid back and relaxed. Great experience for a first timer. I will be back and I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a quieter place during their stays in Bali.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
185,"Clean, helpful staff, good wi-fi",40,March 2016,"My stay here started on Nyepi day of silence. Because everyone was inside the wi-fi did struggle under the load, but after that it was excellent. Rooms nice and clean, buffet every morning but it's the same food over and over so if you want variation you may have to order specially. The complimentary massage with scoopon was wonderful and pool is really close to every room. Only thing is if you are not in a pool access room you have to walk back to room while wet and the floors throughout the hotel are beautiful, yet slippery, marble.
Overall a good spot in a nice out of the way place. Cabs are still working out where this one is so make sure to screenshot a pic of the location on phone or take a card with you when shopping.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
186,Good value for money by purchasing the Scoopon deal,40,March 2016,"My partner and I stayed at the Alea hotel for 11 nights and found it great value for money by purchasing a Scoopon deal, which included two couples massages, daily breakfast, two dinner vouchers and free wifi. The staff was lovely and provided recommendations for restaurants, transport etc. they even helped me get my phone back when I left it behind in a taxi in Kuta. The hotel was clean and overall we found our stay pleasant and good value for money if you get the Scoopon deal.

Wifi speed was average, daily breakfast was average and not varied. Western food was OK but not amazing and the hotel is located a fair walk away from Seminyak Square. We found the location to be great since we wanted to stay a bit away from the crowded tourist areas.

Would recommend staying here if you want a laid back spot and are ready to travel 15 minutes by taxi to get to Seminyak Square. Definitely try to get the Scoopon deal to make it an extra sweet deal.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
187,Good but wifi struggles,40,March 2016,"We purchased a Scoopon for this hotel, not really knowing what to expect when we arrived. We waited a long time for our ride from the airport as the driver was waiting for two other groups to arrive also, which wasn't a good start, but from then on it was quite a good experience. The staff were all very friendly and happy to help, including making a few phone calls to companies to help organise activities for us. The room was a good size and always cleaned well, with great air conditioning. The breakfast wasn't too bad; mainly Indonesian style, which I quite enjoyed but it wasn't varied much. The restaurant menu for all other times was quite good. The wifi struggled often which was enormously frustrating, especially on Nyepi (the Balinese silent day for their new year) where we couldn't leave the hotel. This was the MAJOR downfall. The pool was very nice but doesn't get much sun during the day. The location wasn't too bad; not far from Seminyak Square with a shuttle bus at 10am every day. It's a little out of the way and the hotel itself didn't seem well known so I recommend taking one of their business cards to show taxi drivers. Close to the beach and bars like Potato Head and similar. Overall it was quite a positive experience!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
188,Thoughtful and considerate staff are the back bone of this hotel !,40,February 2016,"This was a voucher deal and the hotel was value for money . I had a mobility issue and the staff went out of their way to accommodate me .There is nothing much to complain about . A couple of suggestions are warranted however ! The colour of the towels would be better of not being white ! There are in grained stains that will not come out but are clean ! So blue or green would be suitable . My main semi-gripe was the temperature of the food in general . COLD ! Although a bain-marie was used the tea lights were not adequate .There was choice for everyone and plenty of fruit ,papaya yummo! One thing that would promote the area would be an information file ,promoting the spa especially which was very good and the activities etc in the ares . Overall I would recommend this hotel to my friends who require a value for money hotel with a rice padi right next door !! Thanks to Puta who was so helpful and considerate .",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
189,Quick stopover,40,March 2016,"Just did a quick stop over here, the hotel is clean, the staff are really helpful and friendly, the location is in a quite location, the Taxi driver struggled to find.
Upside rooms and place is clean and comfortable, and would recommend young groups and couples. Its nice and quite location.
Downside was my room smelt of damp, but I couldn't see where it was coming from.
The package for breakfast, dinner welcome drinks and massage is not worth the money, because welcome drinks is a small glass of ginger beer, the meal is off a separate menu and is nice but small",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
190,What a disaster,20,March 2016,"Be warned those who have purchased a Scoopon deal for this hotel,as you will not get what you expect.We purchased the pool room access deal for 10days and although through the day the pool was great the noise from other guests at night was disgraceful,the pool closes at 8 pm and yet every night it was a call to reception around midnight to complain about the noise at the pool.added to this the food was below average with little variety for breakfast mainly Asian food and at one stage I could not have breakfasts because they had run out of bread juices etc, the hotel has a huge guest intake of Chinese and Japanese people who seem to be catered for with the food but being Australian the western food is not readily available.There is one shuttle bus that takes you to Seminyak square daily and the hotel is situated a fair way out. tHe staff as usual in BAli are beautiful and do there best to please guests however this would be the worst deal I have taken and never again would I purchase a Scoopon, the photos of the hotel are not what it is in reality. Just a bad choice we made",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
191,It was better than I thought!,40,February 2016,"So my bf and I stayed in a pool access, deluxe room. Thought it was small, it was very clean and bed was queen size, spacious for us. I didn't like the location of the room which was at the end of the hall but somewhat didn't bother as well. Food for breakfast though had little variety, was tasty and I actually kind of liked it. Breakfast is upstairs in an open air area, could get hot, but it's Bali after all. Everywhere is hot and humid :)
Voucher for dinner was used and food was average, could use more salt to season :p
Loved the pool, there are two long ones, and they only get the sunlight a couple of hours a day, from 12 - 2ish.
It was a quiet little hotel, away from the crowd but close enough to the main streets and eateries so it was perfect for us. Just a couple of mins to the left of the hotel there is Mocadu, a place to rental motorbikes, very convenient and highly recommended.
The staff at Alea was accommodating and friendly. I have nothing to complain on this matter. Price was great and we loved staying there.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
192,Nice hotel,40,February 2016,"We got a voucher deal for the hotel so paid a very reasonable price. For this we got an amazing deal. The hotel is good, not luxury but at the price that shouldn't be what you expect. Clean, reasonable sized rooms. Large shower. Everything you need.

The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from shops. A bit out of the way of the main strip which has its good points as you are away from the hustle and bustle. There is a free shuttle service every morning to take you to the main part of Seminyak which makes the distance not a problem.

There are two pools, they only get the sun for a few hours everyday but this wasn't a problem to us as we spent most of our time out exploring and if we wanted the sun timed it to work for us.

We didn't have the dinner but the breakfast was good. Maybe needed a bit of variation as it got very repetitive towards the end. Try the Asian dishes as these are better than the other options. You are in Bali after all, get out of your comfort zone and try something new for breakfast!

Lastly, the staff are amazing. All so helpful and lovely. We fell sick and they were very kind towards us and offered to help as much as possible. Gorgeous bunch of people, especially the amazing Putu!

In all a good, affordable place to stay.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
193,Awesome Honeymoon Trip,50,December 2015,"We stayed 4 nights at Alea after our trip from Gili Islands. To surprised my husband when booking I noted as honeymoon trip and the hotel surprised us with very nice decoration of flowers on floor and also on bed. We got a pool access room; just steps to jump to the nice swimming pool. The hotel location is perfect for us, not in the crowded area but easy to reach beach only 10 minutes by walking. By walking in some minutes, you also will find some nice restaurants. The lobby is unique with staffs are friendly; the food is fine and our favorite are fresh juice and satay.. so yummiii!! With the cheaper hotel rate, we have a nice experience staying at Alea. Definitely will back again.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
194,Disgustingly dirty,10,December 2015,"My partner and I stated at the Alea for 7 nights. First room we were given was on the top floor at the back of the hotel with no pool view (which we payed for), there were large bugs over our floor, our bedroom door opened up to the only staff smoking area and elevators were broken on our side of the hotel (for the entirety of our stay) so it was about a 5 minute walk to get to and from our room. After asking to switch rooms we were told the whole hotel was booked so we waited to speak to the manager who advised us there was only 1 room available on the ground floor (opening up to the pool) for an extra $100.00. We decided to take the room hoping that anything could be better than the last room but yet again we were disappointed. The room we got absolutely reeked (after the air freshener wore off) it was so musty, we couldn't pick if it was mould or dirt. Later that night I checked behind the bed, I had to find the source of the smell and there were many spiders/bugs and a lot of dirt (see attached pictures) It was even building up in and around the bedside tables. I called reception to bring a broom and someone comes back with a garbage bag? (On many occasions we found it was almost impossible to communicate to staff in this hotel) he gave it a little sweep and then started to pack up, I had to get into the area to clean it properly.
The smell of course came back 10 minutes after we sprayed an air freshener, again and again and again. It was almost unbearable. (No refund for the $100 was offered) Finally they moved us to yet another room on the 2nd last night and to my surprise... Broken toilet and soap/shampoo dispensers were also broken.
Also, breakfasts were pretty horrible too. We went 1/7 mornings.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
195,Passable,30,February 2016,"We leave the Alea Hotel tomorrow. We have enjoyed our stay..plus points are the hotel is clean and in good condition. The staff are friendly and helpful. We had a 10 day scoopon which included breakfast, 2 x 2 course meals and 2x half hour massages per person.
It was chinese new year so breakfast was very busy a few days and staff tried hard to keep food and utensils replenished.
We are sunlovers so were disappointed that the hotel pool area was shaded most of the day.also being wet season it was cloudy a lot of the time...not the hotels fault!
The beach was a mostly pleasant walk from the hotel but due to heavy seas there was a significant amount of debris and litter on the beach which was off putting but a clean up was in process! We found it better to walk to the left a long the beach and past Potato Head and the beach got better the further away you went .
The food was ok but usually not very hot. One night we decided to have our meal deal at the hotel and as we approached the hotel the music was pumping, we thought there was a party or something happening upstairs in the restaurant only to find it was totally empty apart from us , which seemed really bizarre! They changed music to reggae after a while but didn't turn it down or attract any other customers!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
196,Nice hotel,30,February 2016,This hotel still new. Bit far to find out because the place must be enter to the small road. However..the room is clean..have 2 swimming pools. When we had breakfast..some of foods almost empty and the staff not well prepared to refill again until I asked them. The location also close to legian and kuta. Just around 30 minutes with motor. You can hire the motor there. So cheap. I hope I can back soon.,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
197,The alea,30,January 2016,"We booked for 7 nights with a SCOOPON deal which included airport transfers, 2x 30minute massages, 2x welcome drinks and 2x set two course meal. We did choose to leave and only stayed 5 nights due to the location.

Pros:
-friendly, helpful staff
-lovely 2 course set dinner
-amazing massages!
- neat and tidy little room

Cons:
-breakfast (if you're a westerner) is pretty disappointing, we are out most mornings)
-location: it's so far out from anything and every cab we got into had never heard of the hotel so definitely carry the address with you to show drivers.
- room service: there's a very limited menu so not a lot to choose from.
-we asked if we could be transferred to our new hotel instead of the airport transfer and we were denied. It was a bit annoying considering we didn't ask for a refund for the early departure (two nights) and we were meant to get an airport transfer anyway.

Overall it was a lovely stay and a very cheap option.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
198,Cozy Corner,30,January 2016,"This hotel is tucked away in a small street off the main road.
The taxi might have problems locating this place.

The entire vicinity is reasonably clean and cozy with 2 long pools right in the middle.

Room is quite small but enough for a good night sleep.

Basic accommodation and nothing to shout about.

Staff members are friendly.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
199,Great little find,40,January 2016,"We were lucky enough to get a ground floor room so you could step out straight onto the pool area. The pool was very cold but actually really refreshing. The pool area only gets sun for about 2, 3 hours max as of the way the hotel has been built.
Was pretty good for a budget hotel. Location was ok, it's cheap enough to get a taxi to where you want to go. Staff were friendly however didn't understand English very well.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
200,Average,30,January 2016,"I stayed 10 nights at the alea hotel' it started off badly with a 90 minute wait for my hotel transfer , the rooms were very nice and clean, and big enough, the breakfast was quite limited and very little variety, the seating at the pool area was very limited not anywhere near enough seats , the staff were very polite and helpful, it would not be a hotel I would stay at again",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
201,Excellent,50,December 2015,"I booked the hotel for a very nice price and expected less than what I got. I was surprised to see the hotel building, it's new and nicely designed. The staff are helpful but not outstanding. The room is very clean, very modern and comfortable. I read many bad reviews about the breakfast but from what I had, it was not the best but it tasted more than OK. It was buffet breakfast with choices of bread, cereal, porridge and some asian meals. The location is a bit far from the main street, but it makes The Alea a nice and quiet place.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
202,Don't even bother,20,December 2015,"I stayed here over NYE 2015/16 and I would not even bother with this place. They say skip the breakfast, I say skip the hotel altogether! The service was not good - I had to follow up requests frequently, with some requests not even being met. The room lack basics like hair dryer and an iron, even though at the price we paid, I would expect it. The only thing from giving this hotel a terrible rating was the bed was comfy and the bathroom was decent. I will not be staying here again.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
203,Great hotel,40,January 2016,"Enjoyed stay staff were friendly very quiet off beaten track, pool nice and cold although not many seats to sit around and looses sun most of day. Rooms were small but clean and quiet, breakfast average but for the little money we paid well worth it",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
204,Nice,50,January 2016,"The Alea is a nice hotel to stay at. Staff are exceptionally friendly. They are happy to help you with anything you need. The rooms are small but cozy. We had lunch at the restaurant and the meals were very nice. Housekeeping staff are efficient and friendly. The pool is long and narrow like a lap pool so it is never crowded. Airport pickup was great. Some reviews have complained about various things but it is all about perception and peoples varied expectations. If you want a big flashy busy resort then maybe rethink. If you want quiet, calm, friendly this is the place for you.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
205,As advertised,40,December 2015,"2day layover after flight on way to gili meno. Friendly, professional infectiously happy staff. Arranged transfer to meno no problem. Wide open design clean and well kept. Room fine for one..bit cramped for two. Room was clean. Fridge,air, in room safe and cumfy king bed. WiFi worked great for me. Breakfast (not a bkfst person) was better than expected...chicken potatoes indo dishes fruit pastries. If you want a western breakfast don't travel to the east :) area bit out of the way...alternated walk/cab...don't pay more than 50kidr. Poolside room was quiet for me all things considered. Security was pleasant and efficient. It was a decent place to recover from 20 hour flight. The bar restaraunt has potential but most guests go elsewhere for dinner. 21 percent gratuity/tax on top of prices.....just include it eh...other than the dodgy road at night no complaints.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
206,Lovely Hotel,40,December 2015,"Such a lovely hotel with very friendly staff and good priced rooms.

Very good showers/ toilets and exceptionally clean.

My only downside is if you love the sun, due to the way that the buildings are, the pool is never in the sun so you would need alternatives to sunbathe.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
207,Cheap & No Frills,30,December 2015,"I'm writing this in my hotel room at The Alea. I bought the 7 night scoopon and it is value for money - if you are looking for 5 star, this is not the place to be. Before purchasing my scoopon I read mixed reviews, and that is what my stay has been as well - mixed. The room is a small size, but fits a king size bed & I was expecting it to be small after reading reviews. I'm in a pool access room, which is great, but can be noisy if drunk gets get home late and then go to swim as you hear everything. I read lots of bad reviews about the breakfast and restaurant and thought I'd give it a try - but it is really crappy! If you are Asian, the breakfast is for you. For westerners, you can choose from cereal, croissants, bread and fruit - that's it. They do cook eggs to order, but nothing else. I asked for mushrooms, baked beans and bacon and they don't have these. The breakfast is also the same very day! Plus it isn't refreshed during the service, so if you arrive after 9am expect hot milk, dryed out bread, hard croissants and hot fruit.
I used the dinner voucher as well on 2 different nights and the dinner was awful - it just tasted really bad; had the steak and spaghetti bol and it was terrible. I asked for the steak to be medium rare and it was well done; the spaghetti bol was just awful as well - all spaghetti and no meat or sauce. I went to the restaurant most nights to check out the atmosphere and each night there was no one in there at all - my advice is just eat out!
They advertise a pool bar, but this isn't operational and after asking I found out that it hasn't been used for 6 months. Even though I'm here in December and the weather is 35 - 39 degree's most day, the pool is freezing cold (and I love cold water) as it is not in the sun, I went to get in most days but ended up not as it was way to cold.
The staff are friendly though; however I did have a call from reception at 11pm one night to confirm my reservation at the day spa 2 days later - even though I made the reservation at 8am that morning - they woke me up, so perhaps need help on timing when calling guests.
Overall, the location is great, it is down an alleyway, but I knew that when I booked it and when using taxi (only use bluebird), I just gave each one a card of the hotel and they knew where to find it.
The AC in the room is great. I got a second swipe card so I could leave it on all day in my room which was great.
The room also had great wifi and was pretty quick and reliable, which was awesome.
Not sure I'd stay here again as I'd probably go for something a bit more up market - but that's just my choice.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
208,Nice and homey hotel,40,December 2015,"the atmosphere is comfortable, cool, clean swimming pool, perfect for a honeymoon, friendly service, clean hotel rooms, but its cable television broadcasts are not clear, less varied breakfast menu, close to downtown and entertainment, overall hotel is nice and highly recommended",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
209,Value for money,40,December 2015,"This hotel is really value for money. The rooms although a bit small (compared to usual Bali standard) were clean and beds comfortable. Very fast room service.

Pros
- price, value for money
- very friendly and helpful staff
- peaceful environment and surroundings
- decent breakfast (the Asian selections were far better than the western selections), cannot really complain consider the room rates
- free wifi
- the spa menu looks reasonable but didn't get a chance to try
- strong air con (actually a bit too strong for me)
- good security, I noticed that the security guard at entrance had note down hire car driver and taxi number details and guest room numbers when going out

Cons
- location was bit out of the way, a bit far to walk in the heat to the nearby Seminyak area (maybe only 15 -20 mins walk), however taxi is readily available, approx A$3-4 to Seminyak Square and the restaurants & shops near potato head. There is really not much around the immediate hotel area
- restaurant food was limited but I did have a good nasi campur meal there on the last night

Overall, this hotel is value for money and I'd rather stay here then the noisy and busy Kuta area.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
210,Great stay,40,December 2015,"The Alea Hotel exceeded our expectation.
Clean rooms, great pool and delicious breakfast (if you like Asian food).

The hotel is a bit out of the way, but if you are looking for a place to stay away from all of the noise, I would recommend The Alea Hotel.
The road of the hotel is a bit long, dark and dodgy, so we avoided walking down it at night as we didn't feel comfortable.

We only had dinner in the restaurant once and it wasn't great. You're better off eating elsewhere.

The staff are friendly and are willing to help you out with anything you need.

The spa experience is a bit awkward and needs some work. But the massage itself was really great.

The experience has been great at Alea, I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seminyak.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
211,Value for money,30,December 2015,"We stayed on a Scoopon voucher and it was AUD $299 for 7 nights including transfers, breakfast, a 30 minutes massage and a dinner.

The rooms are small, but they are clean. Unfortunately the water you get daily comes in really small bottles, which basically caters for one clean of your teeth. Also, I think they ration the toilet paper. The rolls are really small and some days they don't even leave an extra roll for backup. I had to call housekeeping on two occasions for more.

The breakfast is average, unless you are happy with Nasi Goreng, fried potatoes and noodles. You can ask for eggs if you want. The scrambled eggs are great!

The staff are friendly, the massage fantastic and the pool refreshing.

It's a hike to the main park of Seminyak - especially in the super humidity, but for a $3 AUD taxi ride you're there.

The walk to the beach is nice and takes about 15 minutes, then along the beach you are quite close to. Woo Bar, Potatohead and Ku De Ta.

Overall, it was a nice stay - I wouldn't recommend it for family's or party goers.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
212,Excellence short stay,40,December 2015,I decided to stayed at the Alea hotel Seminyak for one day escape from my routine. Its a good choice since I really enjoyed here.

Rooms good with solid walls between rooms, i'm a light sleeper but i heard no noise from adjacent rooms which were occupied.Good location, its off the main ,busy road, and is a short scenic walk to the beach.The airport pickup service helps.Has good free wifi.I'd return any day.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
214,Great value for money,40,November 2015,"I booked this hotel via scoopon 10 nights pool access room. I did some research realize that it was a little out the way of the hustle and bustle but that wasn't a bad thing we were going to relax for my birthday, I was totally taken back when on my actual birthday they made my a cake and printed me a card wishing me happy birthday. It made me very special.

I read a lot of feed back on here and was worried....(but I guess these teething problems have all been fixed.)
Because I didn't need to be.

-pool temperature was good (if anything too warm)
-our room was perfectly cleaned every day
-great size bathroom
-we were picked up on time by hotel staff member.
- polite caring staff
- WIFI was stable
-we aked for second room key to keep aircon on all day.

Yes the rooms are a little small but you don't go to bali to sit in your room all day. For a couple this room is perfect we had no issue. Family might find it difficult though

Highlight of hotel was in house massage. Total bliss. We got 2 free massages with voucher which we used and went back for more. So relaxing..

But if I'm brutality honest the food in restaurant is well below average borderline un-eatable. We tried it 4-5 times and only once was tolerable. (Breakfast omelet )

So in a nut shell yes it is a bit off main drag but cheap taxis fix that, super clean, attentive staff, fabulous massages.

We would definitely come back.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
215,"isolated, small and smelly",30,August 2015,"we stayed her for 7 nights in August in a pool access room. We found this to be very isolated as it was up a beat up road in the middle of nowhere.

The staff we very friendly and willing to help",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
216,Good value,40,October 2015,"Stayed for 5 nights in Pool View room. Group of 4 friends booked on a Scoopon deal. Our flight was delayed by 3 hours and I was worried that there would be no transfer for us, but it was lovely to find a smiling face holding a sign for us. He had waited the whole time for us, which after such a delay was a relief.
The same guy who did the transfer checked us into our rooms. No problems, even though it was 3am! All the other staff were welcoming, always smiling and saying hello.
Rooms are small but so what? Its not a mega resort where you plan to spend all your time in your room. Rooms were refreshed daily, housekeeping even rolled up my hair straightener cord every day. We were on 2nd floor, no problems with Wifi.
Only used the pool once, it was too cold. Would have liked the bar to be open, or be able to bring our own drinks along to sit around the pool. But against pool rules.
Breakfast was enough, ate there most days, good for the budget conscious as it was included in our stay, its not far to find other places if its not your thing.The Parlour has amazing food and is very close by.
Had the complimentary dinner, my beef rendang was pretty good. Open air restaurant was breezy and nice to see the rice fields around.
The walk to the beach is a little trek, definitely check out Jepun Day spa along the road, great prices and lovely staff, spent 3 hours in there, the best massage I had the whole trip. Beach access to resorts like Woo Bar and Mozaic Beach club.
I would happily stay at Alea Hotel again. Stay here if you want to get away from the noise of the main centre.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
217,VALUE +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,40,October 2015,"We stayed at the Alea on a Scoopon deal ""$400 for two persons in a pool access room with daily breakfast, welcome drink, complimentary dinner, 30 min massage and free WIFI"". Rooms although on the small size were very clean, bed and pillows so comfortable and pool although narrow and limited deck chairs, clean and inviting. For what we paid the accommodation was fantastic. Close walk to beach, mini market and food outlets. Staff were very accommodating and the pool towels were large, fresh and soft. Breakfast although largely catering for the Asian pallet, was fresh and ""us Aussies"" could order eggs any way and a mixed omlette which was great! This hotel is value for money but............I would recommend you stay in the pool access rooms as there are limited deck chairs and given the size of the hotel, when full unless you were in the pool access rooms getting a place near the pool would be nearly impossible.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
218,Value for money.,30,September 2015,We stayed here in September 2015.It is a little isolated from downtown Seminyak but cheap taxis solved this problem.BE SURE TO USE METERED TAXIS.This way you don't have to worry about fare haggling or being ripped off.USE THE BLUEBIRD METERED TAXIS which the hotel will order for you..The rooms were nice but paintwork was a bit poor.Staff were very friendly and tried to be helpful.Included buffet breakfasts were quite good but it was exactly the same every day.A little variety would have been appreciated.DO NOT LEAVE OPEN FOOD IN YOUR ROOM AS ANTS CAN BE A PROBLEM.Be sure to visit the Vasanti Resort (next door) cocktail bar on 6th floor. The view is wonderful and the whole floors' open plan bar was well worth the visit.The Alea has a few teething problems to correct but is very good value for money and I would return there,The Alea Hotel Seminyak
219,Great value for money,50,October 2015,"Well, were in our last day of a 3 week stay at the Alea in Seminyak. Im in the pool writing my review. If your after a 5 star hotel the Alea is not for you. However if your after great value for money then its a must.
I was a bit concerned about the location when we booked and it seemed a bit out of the way. I even did a virtual walk through of the streets on google maps and thought it might have been too isolated. Ye, its down a dodgy road in between villas an rice fields but the location couldnt have been more perfect.
You are a 5 minute cab ride or $3 AUS to seminyak square where there is a myriad of great restaurants and shops, a $6 AUS can ride to Kuta and a 10 minute walk to Seminyak beach which was our favourite beaches of our whole stay. Seminyak beach is home to some fantastic 5 star hotels like the W Resort, The Samaya and The Seminyak where you can crash and have some drinks watching the sunset or theres Potato Head which is a popular beach club with a Miami vibe. Our favourite was the Beach Cantina which is a beach warong serving cheap eats and Bintang while your watching the sunset on free beanbags.
We loved our stay here. The staff are very friendly and always willing to help and the value for money is fantastic. Yes the rooms aren't massive but quite suitable for a couple and all the amenities are modern and clean. The bed was a bit firm but i got use to it. The pillows and bedding was soft and comfortable and the bed was a massive king size.
The only negative thing was the hotel food especially the free breakfast. We didn't enjoy the breakfast at all and actually went to Biku round the corner most days. The service in the restaurant was terrible with either our starters and mains coming out together or one person having to wait while the others had completed their meal and the quality was extremely ordinary. Having said that for only $49 a night with direct pool access i dont know what people expect and with a myriad of great restaurants close by this didnt bother us one bit. It was just a shame as the upstairs restaurant has everything going for it except the food quality. Would we stay here again? Definately!!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
220,Value!,40,October 2015,"We bought a Scoopon for this hotel and weren't really expecting too much. We were very surprised! Our first impression when we arrived was we've hit the jackpot here. The hotel is very clean, the paintwork is fresh and clean, the staff are extremely pleasant and friendly and it is in an area we like. The room we were given was a bit on the tight side but quite adequate and the pool area isn't terribly inviting mainly because it surrounded by the building on all four sides so quite narrow. There are a limited number of pool beds but we never had trouble getting one. They are the only two negatives I could find. The breakfast is more suited to Asians but, having said that, we still ate there every morning and found the food very fresh and satisfying. The platters, etc are constantly filled so no shortage there. It is about 1km down a back road / alley to the beach and there are a couple of very cheap but nice warungs there where you can watch the sunset. We ate there on four occasions and can vouch for the food.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
221,Good budget hotel,30,September 2015,"We booked this Hotel through the recent Scoopon deal. We were picked up by a friendly Alea staff member at the airport with no problems. Bit of a mix up with our room at first. We were given a twin room but had requested a double room & a travel cot. This was rectified quickly but they couldn't provide a cot. Beds were comfortable. Room was small but very pleasant.
We had dinner on the first night which was good. Had breakfast one morning and ate out the rest of the trip. Breakfast is enough to get you started in the morning...toast, danish pastries but mostly noodles & rice.
We had a pool access room but we didn't use it as there was very little sunlight at it.
We found all the staff very friendly & professional. The massage was fantastic so well worth booking in.
The location was a bit tricky as we had our 1 year old in a stroller and the lane was a bit of a challenge with uneven surfaces & traffic.....but we managed. Furthermore as far as I could see there was no wheelchair access. Plus points regarding location, Potato Head & W Retreat are a 10 minute walk. Seminyak Square 5 minutes in a taxi. I found most of the pavements in Seminyak tricky with the stroller.
If you are a couple, group of friends and intend to be out of the hotel everyday for excursions etc then this is a great place to stay. I wouldn't recommend it for families as the rooms are small, pool area not great & laneway a bit dodgy for walking down with a stroller.
All in all, a great value for money hotel. The very friendly, accommodating staff make it a lovely experience to stay.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
222,Great value for $49 a night,50,October 2015,"I'm currently sitting by the pool writing my review. If your after a 5 star hotel with all the trimmings this hotel is not for you. Having said that it represents extremely good value for money. I booked the hotel with a bit of trepidation at first. Having looked at google maps and doing a virtual run through surrounding streets I thought it was in the middle of nowhere. It can be hard for taxis to find but have the address on your phone and it's no problem as its down a little narrow street just off Jl Pettinget.
Ok, let's do the negatives....
-We tried the breakfast the first day and it was terrible. The only thing we liked was the noodles and rice, even the eggs tasted funny. We have eaten in the restaurant and it is so so but with
Seminyak square only a 5 minute cab ride away you have a plethora of great restaurants to choose from. Our favourite so far is Ginger Moon (just down from Seminyak Square) and for breakfast you can not go past Biku (make sure you try the high tea breakfast and the coffee is the best in Bali and only $10 Aus which includes a sample plate of hot food and pastries and coffee).We have gone to Biku 3 out of the 6 days we have been here for brekkie and the food is amazing! Most dishes are only $4-$6 and are all delicious. Having only paid $49 for a pool access room we are not fussed about the breakfast that everyone wingers about. Seriously don't know what they expect for the money. Minimum cab fare is 30k (about $3 Aus) and that would get you almost to Kuta. Just ask reception and they will call one for you.
-The beach is not in your doorstep. It's about a 10 minute walk through a couple of dodgy laneways but definitely worth the walk. Having previously stayed at Kuta the beach at Seminyak is far cleaner and very family friendly. There are 2 great beach warongs serving basic food and cheap drinks. You can hire a beach chair with umbrella for 50k ($5 Aus) all day and large bintangs are 35k. We loved it there and will go back!
Now the positives...
- For $49 Aus you get a direct pool access room. Yes the pool is a little cool (about 24 degrees) but is very refreshing considering the heat. We have found if you don't create a racket you can go in the pool anytime and have never been asked to get out at night.
-The rooms aren't massive but have everything you need and are well maintained. The mattress is firm but after 1 or 2 nights I have found it very comfortable. The linen and cushions are very soft and the air conditioner is great! Huge rain shower in the bathroom and soft towels ( the pool towels are huge and very soft too if you want to go to the beach)There is no DVD players but can be hired for $15 Aus a day but who needs to? There is no international plug but just ask reception and they will supply one for you.
-There doesn't seem to be a huge occupancy and most people are here on scoopon deals. Most times there are only a couple of people in the pools so you seem to get them to yourselves. The people we have mostly met are Aussies like us so we have met some great people here and had a couple of great nights by the pool.
-The staff here are fantastic and definitely a credit to the hotel. No request is too much and they are super friendly.
-The pools are maintained regularly and the hotel is fogged once a week between 5 and 6pm on Sunday's to stop mossies ( I haven't been bitten once here yet). Make sure you aren't in your room if your on the ground floor when they fog as it totally engulfs the hotel for about 20 minutes. If you go to the lobby or restaurant it's fine. I would much rather that tiny inconvenience once a week that get bitten alive by mossies.
-You can get laundry done cheaper elsewhere but with most garments in the 75c to $1.50 range and them smelling really fresh we have found the hotel convenient.
-Potato Head beach club and the W Resort are around the corner and are great places to see the sunset. While the food and drinks at both are expensive by Bali standards they have AMAZING settings and are what you would pay at a restaurant for food and drinks back home. For 6 people at Potato Head for a 2 course dinner each and a couple of drinks each it was only $220 Aus. Definitely worth a try! Be warned though it is extremely busy around sunset so be prepared to wait an hour or so for a table (I recommend booking it as soon as you arrive and then once you've had a drink and looked around your table will be ready).

We are wrapped with this hotel and would definitely stay again for the value for money.....",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
223,Value for money,40,October 2015,"We spent 5 nights on a groupon voucher. Good value for us as family of 4 needing 2 rooms. Breakfast was ok they will cook eggs to order, its enough on the buffet to start your day. Friendly staff in restaurant of a morning. We had late night flight arrival with an airport pickup which went smoothly and easy checkin when arrived at the hotel. Approx $2 per taxi ride in and out of seminyak square area too far to walk in the heat of the day about 25 to 30mins if walked. For us was perfect for our needs & relaxing as we had pool access rooms.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
224,Decent hotel but staff not well trained and better hotels nearby,30,September 2015,"Pros:
-Newer hotel.
-Friendly staff at breakfast.

Cons:
-Slow check-in. Guy gave me room closest to lobby--so loud. So had to ask to move.
-Wifi did not reach my second room (at end of corridor) and dumb staff didn't think about moving me to a better room.
-No golf cart shuttle available like two hotels next door.
-Hot water maker in room was dirty inside.
-Housekeeping staff didn't clean toilet during multi-day stay.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
225,Good but there are better places out there..,30,September 2015,"We stayed here for 3 nights and all I could say is it's a very average hotel.

Rooms: OK sized, showers are OK, AC is very cold which is good for Bali, but the towels and toilet seat are super dirty.. The least a hotel could do is just provide clean towels instead of those which looks like they are stepped by the staffs prior to be put on the towel rack :( Also our friend's room have the hand soap dispenser, where ours have no hand soap dispenser or even soap bar!! So we have to literally walk in and out to the shower to get the soap..

Breakfast food: OK, just decent..

Location: Far away from the busy scene of Seminyak, but it's OK for those wanting a quieter place to sleep at night..

Overall, if you have options, try to get another hotel closer to the busy location and have cleaner toilet equipments.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
226,The Alea Cendrawasih,30,September 2015,"This is a review from room 116

Positive:
paid 550 K for pool access room. Big room. Strong wifi. Nice pool view. Decent breakfast; delicious thin noodle and fried rice. Very helpful staff. Clean sheets. Quiet atmosphere.

Negative:
Bad smell from the bathroom. Given a pool access room but could not use it for the pool can be used after 9 AM. Disappointing. Had closet flush button problem all night.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
227,Do not buy through Scoopon,10,September 2015,"We purchased a Scoopon voucher 10 nights $49 per night ( not saving $150 per night). Definatley not worth a cent more. The bedroom was small as was the bathroom ( shower and toilet , no wash basin). The wash basin was in the bedroom and no hot water so had to wash hands under the shower , room had a very strong foul water smell which was unbearable. We used a wet towel and placed over shower drain to stop the smell . Wife's tip....... Byo hair dryer as none in the room.
We have been to Bali many times, this was the first time we both got sick, as did all of the guests we spoke to.
Breakfast was ok? There was a pool bar, however not operational. Pool area was fine, only 8 daybeds for the guests. Wifi slow had to relog many times during the day.Shuttle service not available the 2 days we booked
Never again.......",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
228,Cheap hotel in Seminyak,30,September 2015,"Location is good and the price is right. Didn't have adjoining rooms like was advertised and staff don't appear to know how to work out the online booking so I suggest you print and bring your booking details with you. In house breakfast is ok, but not much choice. Fine for somewhere cheap to sleep. Staff were helpful, but seemed a bit unsure.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
229,Excellent,50,April 2015,"This hotel is close proximity to the beach, the staff was very friendly, they helped me book my tours and made sure my stay was enjoyable. The breakfast was good, the rooms were clean and they have a great pool, would definitely stay here in the future.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
230,"Financially ""worry-free""",40,July 2015,"Price is cheap! Location is okay, though it took me an hour to walk from here to the crowded area near seminyak square. Our room was small, however it was more than enough for two people. Everything except for the long breakfast refills were great. Recommended for travellers seeking for relaxation on a budget.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
231,Budget and would not recommend,10,August 2015,"Very disappointing. Emailed them a week before we arrived to let them know of our flight details and remind them that I had booked rooms next to each other for our family. No one at airport to collect us, waited 45 min till we found a number and called them using international roaming. Suggested we wait another 45 min and they will send bus. I see that they do this a lot but really started the holiday with a bad taste in our mouths. Arrived by taxi and rooms were not next to each other. Paid extra for pool access but could not see pool from room. After a few days and constant complaints, I went to the manager and finally got side-by-side rooms.

Do not stay here if you want to sleep. Noise from foyer kept us awake late into the night and then breakfast service woke us up early. One night had enough and at 2 am asked reception staff to turn foyer music down. Next night had a busload of chinese tourists arrive at similar time who proceeded to walk around pool chatting loudly at 3.00 am. Mattresses like bricks. The whole hotel is geared towards busloads of chinese tourists.

The daily breakfast was terrible so we ate out every morning - no egg station, bacon etc - ok if you want asian porridge or salad. Dinner was average and expensive. Two softdrinks and two juices cost us nearly $20.

Lovely housekeeping boy but had to return replaced towels to him several times as they were filthy. He explained that they had come back from an external laundry.

I agree that the soap containers were broken. Hotel is located down a back alley so can't step out and have a massage, you have to walk to one of the main streets to get a taxi. Had to keep on entering Wifi password, which was annoying as it was numbers and letters. Pool was freezing as it doesn't get the sun and has only EIGHT beds. These are grouped together in two's so as a family we could not sit together. REALLY small bedrooms.

Saying this, good price if you are after a cheap basic hotel for a holiday where you are happy to be out all day, eat elsewhere and able to walk far. I have to add that the staff are very friendly and welcoming. As I've said already, this hotel should continue to focus to the Asian tourists as their target audience. Personally, I would not go back. It is not a family focused hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
232,Good budget accommodation,30,September 2015,"Budget value if you don't mind walking everywhere don't bother with breakfast not value better off eatting out and about on way to beach
Or revolver for best coffee
Clean small rooms quiet area
Pool hardly used as gets no sun non existent pool bar
Good value if just need place to sleep and happy to get out and about by foot",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
233,Room for improvement,20,August 2015,"I stayed here for 10 days with a friend on our recent trip to Bali. For the most part it was a pleasant stay however it was not the 3-star standard that we were used to on our other trips to Bali. We always stay 3-star and our expectations are always exceeded - but not at Alea Hotel.
The daily breakfast was very limited and not at all appertising.
When we first got to our room we found dirty coffee mugs and no drinking glasses. The glasses and mugs were not refreshed during our stay and we often had to go to the kitchen to get clean ones.
The soap containers didn't dispense any soap because they were broken.
The towels, although they smelt clean, were heavily stained.
There was no DVD player in our room and the hotel wanted $15AU a day to hire one from them.
When we asked reception to contact a driver of our choice, they deliberately misdialled the phone number and forced us to use drivers supplied by the hotel. This happened on 3 different occasions.
Overall The Alea Hotel is at the very low end of the 3-star and needs to improve in order to compete with the 3-star standard in Bali.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
234,Better than we expected...,40,August 2015,"It was a great experience staying at The Alea for 10 days while we're in Bali for 13 days trip. We stumble upon Alea while we were looking for something with decent price and most important location. We bought the voucher thinking it was another let down, however they proved us wrong.
The staffs were extremely understanding from the start, our flight got cancel due to Volcanic Ashes, they were happy to move the check-in and check-out date without a problem.
The best feature probably its location, it's well tuck away from the busy crowd - very quiet and relaxing. Seminyak Square is approx. 15-20mins away and the walk can be quiet good with lots of restaurants, cafes, money changes, mini marts and a laundrette close-by.
Breakfast is quiet good actually, however it is a let down when it's pretty much on repeat every single day for 10 days.
The room is a bit smelly but not really the hotel fault. Because it is locate between two rice fields, every morning when the sun is up - there is this peculiar smell coming from the toilet. Perhaps it would be nice if the hotel place potpourri to mask the smell. We ended up buying 50 cents toilet spray at the supermarket to take away the smell.
The last and worst thing - WiFi. Please increase the bandwidth as the more guests checked in the slower the WiFi gets. Google takes 5 mins to load. Data Simcard is cheap anyway, so I ended up getting 10$ with 3.5GB to tether to my laptop time to time.
Overall, it was a good experience with Alea Hotel, if you're looking for something with decent pricing along with great location, a decent quiet place to stay after a day of exploring Bali, this pretty much it. We'll be back.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
235,Very unhelpful front desk!,10,August 2015,"Stayed in this hotel for two nights due to flight delays. The actual rooms are definitely not as good as they appear on the pictures. For a relatively new hotel, the finish shows renovation was done very rushed or cheaply (paint brushed everywhere and walls are not even flat). Parts of the hotel still unfinished and there is still smell from the construction inside the rooms.

Despite I booked on their official website, they couldn't locate my booking in the system during check in and needed me to email them back the confirmation generated by their system.

There was yellow stain on the sheet and floor towel already had black marks everywhere and wasn't replaced during housekeeping. Breakfast was really really simple and tasteless with food uncovered and lots of flies around the food.

The most disappointing part was actually the front desk - they were smiley and friendly however very unhelpful. I asked them to help to call to change a restaurant booking and they came back with line busy. For two occasions I asked for taxis they told me the line was busy. On my last day, the driver I booked to leave for the airport did not turn up - after I checked out, I asked them to help to call the driver for me they told me no answer and they can't get in touch with the taxi company either since yesterday but trying to sell me their airport service for almost triple the taxi fare.

I just ran across the road to a villa to get their help on a taxi - and the line was connected in two seconds!! Surprise surprise! Then, I realised that it was actually the same excuse every day about getting any service from the front desk - line was busy! Part of the training?

I understand it is a budget hotel but there is no excuse for bad service and it is very unbalinese! People are usually helpful in Bali. If your reception is not willing to offer those services, please put a big sign out and do not waste everyone's time! I would definitely avoid this hotel next time in Bali.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
236,A simple hideaway from the crowd...,30,August 2015,"This is my first time staying in Seminyak, as this is a relatively new hotel, there is issue telling cab driver about it. It's important that you grab a card from the hotel so that you can show the cab. If heading there, just mention Vasanthi Hotel (which most cab drivers are familar with) and can get you in the right direction.

Being a new hotel, the staff is also relatively new, thou the check in process is not entirely smooth (despite not having anyone checking in at the point of our arrival, it still too us more than 15 mins to check in) apart from that, all other matters are very smooth and well managed.

Its about 20 mins (by foot) to the beach, and about 5 mins to a busy stretch of the road where cabs can be flagged quite readily.

The room is simple and cozy, and amenities are also standard. Overall, an ok hotel for a good night sleep away from the bustle of the party.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
237,"Don""t stay here if you want a relaxing peacefull holiday!!!!",20,August 2015,"We stupidly purchased a scoopon deal for this hotel..it included transfers to and from airport..we arrived at the airport to NO transport, however after ringing them they did come to get us 45min later.The rooms are very small and the floors were filthy...we decided to have our dinner at the alea restuarant...bad mistake it was awful..as was breakfast so we didn't bother with meals there after that! The hotel is off the beaten track and has a very strong odor of sewer. our rooms were pool access and we were kept awake until the early hours with people drinking on our doorstep.....then woken early by the staff in the hallways...not a relaxing hotel at all ..we checked out 5 days early and the manager really couldn't care less!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
238,Budget accomodation,30,August 2015,"Airport pickup was included in our package, but no one was there to pick us up. As we are seasoned Bali travellers, we just hired a driver, but if we were 1st timers, I would have been in a panic as the Hotel is not the easiest to find and our driver had to call the hotel for directions. When we finally arrived for checkin the hotel had no booking for us, despite me emailing them earlier in the day and them emailing back confirmation. after showing them my emails, they managed to find us a room. The rooms are small, ours was inhabited by a family of ants, so toothbrushes and any food had to be put away. The towels could do with a good bleaching as they were covered in stains.Our room had that awful sewerage smell. Breakfast was below average. On the positive side the shower was the best, fantastic pressure and hot water. The staff were very friendly and always happy to help.WiFi connection was fast and reliable.We were stuck in Bali due to the volcanic ash, and the hotel was very reasonable in their extra charges and were happy to let us extend our stay day by day.The hotel is a little out the way, just up past potato heads. We booked on a Scoopon so the hotel was good value for the price we paid. Would I stay there again??? Probably Not",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
239,Cheap and reasonable location,20,August 2015,"We have just checked out of the Alea hotel. When we arrived they had no booking for us after eventually finding the booking we checked into a small but well apointed and comfortable room. We went to go for a swim but the pool was so cold because it dosnt get much light. Its about a 15min walk to the strip where potatoe head and most of the popular restaurant are. The breakfast was awful. Even the fruit wasnt good. We had a package deal where we had a message, a dinner and cake included the massage was good but the normal prices are expensive the dinner was ok but the restaurant was empty apart from us. And on the second night the room next to us checked in making for a very noisy stay as you can hear the rooms next door as if the hotel had paper walls. If your looking for a cheap place to stay its not bad but i wouldn't recommend it.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
240,Great apart from a few let downs,30,August 2015,"Great location. Great Price. Great Room. Friendly staff. We rate it 3.5 stars.

Our stay with alea hotel has been great, although there are a few things that could be improved.

Our room is wonderful, the bed is comfortable, it is very clean, nice rain shower and very quiet.

Location was great, 5min walk to potato head, 15 min walk to seminyak square and the beach. Everywhere is accessible by taxi, which is super cheap, around 40,000IDR to Kuta.

We selected to have breakfast included. The buffet is very convenient, food was filling, but a limited range. Breakfast at near by cafes is a comparable price and possibly has food more interesting.

Wireless internet is fast, however you need to log in each time you use it, we found this incredibly slow and frustrating, especially as the password had a combination of letters and numbers.

We wouldn't recommend booking tours/transport through the hotel. The prices they quoted were double what other companies quoted, so we booked with companies that were very highly rated in tripadvisor for a fraction of the price. This was a shame because we like to support the hotel and their services, however the prices were just too high.

Overall we had a great experience, with just a few things to work on, this hotel has great potential.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
241,A week stay,40,August 2015,"Happy with the choice, great location just out of the hustle and bustle of Seminyak!
Value for money and staff all very accommodating to any request. Wish the pool got a bit more sun during the day.. Was a little fresh on the gonads..
Breakfast ok, and does the job!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
242,Great value for money,40,July 2015,"After many hours of research there was nothing as cheap as Alea in Seminyak (that was decent).
We ended up purchasing a scoopon $299 for 7 nights, 1 hr massage for 2 people, one dinner for 2 people, daily breakfast and airport transfers. This was an absolute bargain in our eyes.
All rooms in this hotel are the same so there are no bad rooms in regards to size and layout. In saying this, the rooms are extremely small I think just over 20sqm. The walls are paper thin and we were unlucky enough to have some very inconsiderate neighbours who like to get up extremely early and be very noisy. On the third day I did get up and yell at them and the noise stopped so if you have the same issue as me either ask to move rooms or have someone say something. The breakfast is average but we didn't expect much for the price. There were some big groups staying at the same time as us and on two mornings before 9am the restaurant ran out of fruit. We ate out most days for breakfast. The hotel is nice and modern as it only opened last year. It is a short walk to a street of shops and restaurants and about half an hour walk to the Main Street of Seminyak depending on how fast you walk and if you know where the short cut back streets are. Potato Head is also a short walk away and we found a great bikram yoga place around the corner. The pool is nice and refreshing but there are only 8 chairs so get in quick if it's busy. The staff are nice and helpful and the manager assisted us with our requests. It is in a quiet street so it's nice to be away from the hustle and bustle. Overall it's a great hotel with incredible value for money but there are still some minor things to be worked on.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
243,Amazing stay,40,March 2015,"I stayed at alea hotel on March, 2015. I was traveling solo in Bali. I knew this hotel because it was new and I saw the advertisement in Internet. Stayed for 3N/2D. I had a very good experiences. When I checked in, the room was still not prepared well, but as a compliment they gave me another upgrade room with pool access and no extra charge. I was like wowww, I even wait just around 5 minutes. The staffs were really helpful and the services also very good. The room is very clean, small and quiet. More than that, the location is very strategist to bar, resto & cafe. Overall I satisfied and surely will come back to stay at alea hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
244,Great price for what you get!,50,June 2015,"The breakfast buffet was decent, enough for me to be satisfied. The price of the room was crazy cheap to begin with so I didn't expect a gourmet meal. They offered omelets and chicken bacon and sausage, cereal, fruits and salad, mango juice, rice porridge. I liked it! Also the rooms are so nice and clean! The showers worked great. The front desk girl Linda was very sweet and cheerful, she was so helpful as well.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

247,"EXCELLENT SERVICE, AMBIENCE AND STAFF.",50,June 2015,"Name : Prabhakaran Francis

We visited this hotel and stayed here for 5 days.

The food, ambience, staff and service was extraordinary, especially one Mr.Komang ( Hotel Lobby In charge ) was extremely curteous and was ready to assist us as and when required.

Was very impressed with the hotel.

If I return to Bali again I will choose the same hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
248,Excellent Service,50,May 2015,"Our family were blown away by the service of staff at the hotel. They were extremely friendly and went well beyond their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay. They made a big fuss of our children and even suprised us with a birthday cake and card for our youngest child. Facilities were great, comfy bed and fantastic wi fii coverage. We suggested more items to be added to menu for restaurant but what is currently on offer is delicious, staff even cooked items requested for us too which wasnt on menu so one again very accommodating!!!

Great service by hotel manager too, he stopped by one evening to make sure everything was ok and if we needed anything and went beyond normal customer service standards when we left.

Fantastic hotel, well done & keep up the great standard & service and we will see u again (miss the staff already).",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
249,overall is okay but not the breakfast buffet,40,May 2015,"this is the first time we have to spend 2 nights. first time i came and entered the room, its clean and the bathroom is quite big. Its not in the main street of seminyak but, i can find lots of restaurant near from the hotel. And for breakfast, please.... you have to make some change on the menu of your breakfast.. the room was great, the location is good, your staffs are lovely but its not in your buffet. sadly to say",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
250,"Nice hotel, don't count on the breakfast!",30,May 2015,"This hotel is beautiful, the room was lovely and bright, with a nice big bed, clean sheets and spotless bathroom. The location is good, just a short walk from the shops and restaurants and from the beach. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We were excited about the buffet breakfast, which we opted to pay extra for, however when we got there- which was only 7.30 am, everything was gone. We sat patiently waiting for the trays to be refilled while the staff apologised and we waited, and waited and waited; drips and drabs of food came out- noodles and rice, but none of the other food and these were readily swept up by the Chinese masses that joined us for breakfast that morning. The staff were lovely and apologetic but after an hour of waiting you'd have thought the kitchen could have cooked up some more meat and veg- did they not prepare it all in advance?! After all it was only 7.30 am, what would happen by 8 or 9 when the other guests came to eat?!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
251,Nice but could improve,40,May 2015,"This was our first hotel in Bali and set the standard. The bed was super comfy, the rooms were nice and clean, but we had several issues with the pool-access door (kept getting stuck and would have to constantly be repaired by staff). The breakfast was OK (typical Indonesian offerings of 3 types of cereal, toast with jam, eggs if requested, and Indonesian-style breakfast). You could smell the humidity/mould in the room which was off-putting at first entry but you get use to it. I liked seeing a frog/toad hopping down the corridor. The hotel is located in a small street off the main road, about a 5-10 minute walk to/from Potato Head (and beach) and about 20 minute walk to the centre. The walk along the street was a little concerning as there was ""water"" on the road of which we feared was sewage water. There's rice fields on either side of the hotel and it is PRONE TO BLACKOUTS. Great service by staff all around but when eating in the restaurant they lurk a little too close (i.e. stand about 2m away waiting for you to finish so they can grab your empty plate).",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
252,Thank-you great hotel and beautiful people.,50,May 2015,"We started our Bali trip with the Alea and had such a welcoming helpful stay. From pick up the staff were friendly, enthusiastic and educated us on Balinese culture. During the stay there was a mix-up with on of the excursions but Bansia the hotel manager sorted it out straight away - it was the best customer service we've experienced in a long time. The food was amazing so we always had starters and drinks before we headed out. Breakfast was always fresh and also a good variety. Great value! The best bit was I left on my birthday and they surprised me with a cake at breakfast it was so sweet and thoughtful and yummy!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
253,A place of tranquility,50,May 2015,"The Alea is a place where you can have quality time with your family and loved one.

261,Lovely hotel with fantastic staff.,40,April 2015,"We only spent a night here before travelling back home the next day however I wish we had stayed longer. The hotel was clean and modern. The staff were incredibly helpful and caring (our friend had hurt her foot and they were very attentive). There were two beautiful pools and the breakfast was delicious.

The hotel is a little way from the main street but we manage to walk the Potato Head which is right on the beach in just under 15 minutes and there are taxi's everywhere if you don't want to walk.

I would highly recommend this hotel!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
262,Excellent value,40,April 2015,"We got a great price on this hotel.

Staff were friendly and check-in/check-out were quick and easy.

The hotel was quite new, the room was modern and clean with a comfortable bed.

The hotel is located a little way from the centre of Seminyak, but we found the walk quite manageable.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
263,Good value,40,April 2015,"i chose this hotel for its price. I haven't stayed in a ""cheap"" hotel in Bali before, so I was a bit unsure of whether I would regret it. No I did not.
Upon booking I had asked for a quiet room. Upon checking in I was given a room next to the elevator!!

Ugh. Ugh...Please change my room. This was done no problem. After I had unpacked afew things in room number 2 I pulled back the sheets to have a nana nap.....Oh Oh....dirty sheets. Upon closer inspection they were clean, but stained. A girl had just come to the room to deliver the spa & room service menus which were missing from the room, and my frustration was beginning to escalate . I showed the girl the sheets and asked for clean sheets...this took a while to to organise and I was given the option of changing rooms...but because I had already unpacked and just wanted to rest rather than move rooms again ...I stayed where I was and checked the sheets before the housekeeper left the room!!

So far my introduction to the ALEA was not going that well...That hiccup over , everything else was fine.

The room was not large , but being that I was only sleeping there I did not mind.
The bed was very comfortable
The room had an opening window which I like to,use, as I believe fresh air is important...lol.....the AC was a bit noisy so it was peaceful,to,have it turned off for a while.

The pool was well maintained. And fresh towels were always available.
The staff were friendly , always smiling and happy to be of service.
The hotel is situated on a no thru (for cars.) street- therefore it was quiet and next door was a rice field which I hope stays there forever.
I would stay here again if I wanted to be in that area. It was a 10 min walk to the beach",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
264,Clean and comfortable,50,February 2015,"Beside the rate is cheap, but the service and facility really give us good experience when we stay in Bali. The room is realy comfortable althought it litle bit small. Walking distance to the beach. Looking forward to come back.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
265,"Best value for money, great location, helpful hotel staff.",50,February 2015,"I have stayed at the Alea hotel now for the second time in Bali.

He helped me organise everything from bike hire, to dinner reservation and yours. He was sure to look after us without ripping us off. Be sure to drop his name if you want some help it assistance with anything. Suyasakmg will be sure to give you the very best price and service he can find.

The staff are amazing and so friendly. They greet you whenever you pass and take an interest of where you travelled.

Will definitely be back thanks Alea Hotel xxx",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
269,Very nice Hotel at amazing price,50,December 2014,"We were very reluctant to stay at this Hotel only because they charged us peanuts. However, on our arrival we were surprised to see the hotel.

271,Heaven in the heart of Seminyak,40,December 2014,"I experienced stay in the Alea for 2 nights only and it was amazing stay. As i knew this is the hotel open but they could fulfill all their weakness perfectly. I seen there is almost no weakness at all.
The room only 20M2 but its more than enough for traveler who traveling to Bali, where will spent almost their time outside. The interior design was so modern, you can saw it since you step your feet into their lobby. They had 2 long swimming pool right in the middle of their room building. The breakfast was great for 3 stars hotel. Taste was good as well. The restaurant located in the mezzanine with sunset view every evening. You must try whenever you visit Bali. Some not important suggestion just to improve more acknowledge and sense of services for the employee. But overall i'm so satisfied to stayed here...",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
272,Pleasant and peaceful,40,February 2015,"Just returned from Bali , staying 8 nights at the Alea Hotel.

Whilst preference was for a poolside room the rooms were considered to be an upgrade so stayed on the second level which is essentially the same as the lobby.

The night we arrived it was raining hard and the transport provider had difficulty sighting the hotel and negotiating the narrow roadway with potholes and puddles.

Next morning it was a typically clear, sunny Bali day and with staff help, I was able to put a perspective on the location and the surroundings being beach and shops.

The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times and I believe that they clearly outnumbered the hotel guests in the first part of my stay.

Breakfast was included in my tariff and whilst there was a reasonable choice, my taste buds generally restricted my selection to freshly cooked eggs being either omelettes, scrambled or poached. Fruit was freshly cut and juices, danishes and toast and coffee readily available. The bain maries of cooked food were probably typically rice, curries, potato, mini chicken sausage and ""beef bacon"", these foods not hot enough nor palatable to me in the main.

The room service was efficient and left the room smelling fresh each day. I regularly used my two bottles of water to avoid any tummy illness.

Location of the hotel down a narrow lane was not of a concern to me however I could imagine some female concern at walking back to the hotel at night time. I felt safe in this part of town.

There is a lot of construction going on with workers being housed nearby. This former rice field area is gradually being converted into accommodation.

The beach is located at the end of the road past the hotel, and by continuing through a couple of narrow lanes and you come out on the beach front right near Mozaic and W Resort beach front- maybe a 15 minute walk. The beachfront is busy with beachside eateries which can cook up a very decent evening meal to watch the sunset. It is only a short walk along the beach and back to the main road to enjoy a delightful coffee at the Petitenget.

Decisions- to head back by the beach or via the main road. Took the latter, quiet safe except where construction sites block the pathway. Explored the street with many shop fronts, eateries accomodation venues and spas. Joined up with Jl Cenderawasish where there was a little hidden cafe to enjoy a great coffee or a meal or shake.

At this point you could head back to the hotel or continue with walking and exploring the shops and culture of this part of town.

Booked a transfer to Seminyak Square (needs to be booked 24 hrs in advance for the driver to be on) and was taken there with instructions of where to be picked up and time. A bit of confusion as I was in the designated spot, sitting down looking for the bus coming a certain direction but missed the driver. It turned out he came from a different direction (due to bad traffic) and in a smaller van which I was unable to recognise. It cost me a nominal taxi ride back after waiting 40 minutes. A bit miffed until it was explained to me.

The pool area is convenient and pool towels provided. They are two pools and in my time it was well underused. I killed a bit of time there on my last day waiting for transport, but the outdoor shower (cold) and toilet facilities a bit further to reach (the latter near the reception area). I enjoyed a late checkout but still had additional time to wait

This is a reasonably new hotel with good facilities. I note the room hand basins (located outside of the bathrooms) don't have hot water so shaving is more difficult if you need hot water to shave. Otherwise shave in the shower! Rain head shower with hand nozzles were relaxing.

Whilst the finish of the rooms and passageways looked a bit unfinished, you need to relax on this because it is typically Balinese. Additional shelving in the cupboards would be handy.

Booked this hotel because I was cost conscious for this trip, and essentially like the area because you aren't hassled as in Kuta. Taxi's abound and are relatively cheap if you want to go further.

This was my 9th trip to Bali and have stayed in a wide selection of hotels and areas",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
273,worth trying if you're coming to Seminyak,50,February 2015,"definitely worth the money you pay. it's new and clean. walking distance to the entertainment places in Seminyak.

team members are warm and helpful.
check-in process was quick and convenient. room was in good size and nicely designed.
breakfast selection was okay; they serve this very refreshing detox infused water.

they have this restaurant with nice ambience, limited selection of food, but all is good; bolognese, carbonara, cordon bleu...

I am very satisfied to stay there.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
278,New hotel in great location,40,January 2015,"Brand new hotel located in quiet side of seminyak. Rooms are on the small side with a weird set up of the sink being outside the bathroom which is fine just odd.

Service was good from very attentive staff however there is still somewhat of a language barrier as staff didn't understand when I asked for an adaptor.

New hotel so still some minor kinks to be ironed out with service and breakfast was made up of heavy dinner items and somewhat stale bread. Having said that, I would definitely recommend as for that price you get a great location and hotel staff who really are trying to raise their game.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
279,Nice brand new hotel near Batu Belig,30,January 2015,"The Alea Hotel is a brand new place, located at a footstep from Batu Belig and near vibrant streets of Seminyak, in a quiet area.
The venue is new, so it is still in a good shape.

But improvement have to be done for sure : the vis-à-vis between the rooms is a bit embarassing. Indeed, your front neighbours can easily see you through the windows... and you can see them as well.
Then, the phonic isolation is far from being on top. I got a room at the 3rd floor, so I thought I would get peaceful and quiet night. But the noise came through the doors and walls. Well, I'm a easy sleeper, and I can fall asleep in a room up to 120dbs with full blasted neon lights... but still... Too bad.
As for the room itself : very convenient though a bit small... and... why are the sink and mirror separated and outside the bathroom. A bit weird, isn't it ?

Last word : the breakfast. Hum... to be honest, I can't say anything about it as it wasn't included in the room rate, and I won't pay an extra fee just to have my skim-milk tea in the morning.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
280,good place to stayed for low budget,40,January 2015,"low cost new hotel, stayed at room with pool access... room is clean and comfy, breakfast is moderate, pool is just find for free style, and friendly staff... I'll stay here for next holiday...........",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
281,"Pros: fairly new hotel, Cons: poor service.",20,December 2014,"We stayed 3 nights at the Alea Hotel in Seminyak

Pros:
Fairly new hotel, so everything is still clean, un-damaged and in working order. Rooms are comfortable.

Cons:
When you have booked a room with a double bed, they will put you in a room with two separate beds and say they are sorry. Expect no compensation or any kind of willingness to provide a solution. This happened to us and we saw that they treated other guests in the same way when they were checking in at the reception desk.

The location is not great. The road to the hotel is very poor, so keep in mind that especially during the rainy season you have to be prepared to walk through huge puddles of water to get to the main road.

The service at the reception is very poor. For instance, they will say they can not arrange a taxi for you. Instead they will offer you to go with the hotel car, but charge you a multitude. Seems to me that the hotel staff is trying to earn some extra income by ripping hotel guests off.

Wireless internet access in the room only works when you are standing right next to the door or outside your room in the hallway.

The staff does not replace your towel when you put it on the ground, but they place it on the rack again. There is no extra toilet paper in the room.

Breakfast is as you would expect it to be and as it is commonly served.

Overall it is an ok hotel, but the service needs to be drastically improved and is the biggest downside. I would not stay at this hotel again.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
282,Quiet and <a class=,50,December 2014,"I can't ask for more,

I just like a Quiet room so i can relax, and the service was great.

I'm hardly impressed by any small talks and smile that everyone in this business do. But alea Have done a great job to give a honest and sincere service that they can give.

Let the Rate do the talking, Thank you Alea. I'll be back with all my colleagues, you deserve it.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
283,"Average hotel, bad location",30,December 2014,"We stayed at the hotel for a day. It is a fairly new hotel with some construction work still going on.

Good parts:
Clean room
Friendly staff

Not so good parts:
AC wasn't working well in our room
The location is not great. Although there's a beach 15mins walk away, it is not a good beach. Semniyak square is also a bit far
There were limited food options available. Breakfast was bad. Barely any choice for vegetarians

Overall, an Ok hotel but far from the places of interest",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
284,Horrible service & stay,20,January 2015,"I booked and paid for a pool access room at the Alea hotel for 4 nights - when we arrived at the hotel they told us that all of the pool access rooms were fully booked so we had to be moved to a room on the top floor for one night. We weren't impressed as it is more expensive for the pool access rooms and we were not offered any compensation. We were taken to the top floor where our temporary room was and it hasn't been cleaned. They then found another room for us but instead of a king bed it had two singles. We complained to management but all they said was we had to put up with it for one night. We were told we couldn't check into our pool access room until 2 pm the following day. So we went out exploring Seminyak and came back around 2 pm expecting to check in to our new room. Instead they told us it had not been cleaned yet and wouldn't be ready till 5 pm. So we lounged around the pool until 5 pm and then went back up to reception to see if our room was ready. They told us it was and we went down to our room only to find it had not been cleaned. We spoke to management again expressing our frustration. They found another pool access room with a king bed which had been cleaned and we proceeded to go there. Once we got there and unpacked in our new room everything seemed fine until our door started beeping continuously through the night. We had to get reception to come down and fix it. On the third day we left the hotel and put the ""please clean my room"" sign on the door. When we returned at 4 pm they had still not cleaned our room. Instead they came at 6 pm when we were both having a nap before venturing out for dinner. The hotel does not offer a free shuttle service to Seminyak Square and hotel drivers are very over priced. Our stay at Alea hotel was awful. The customer service from management and staff was at a very poor standard. I would not recommend this hotel or stay here again.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak

They called me for a petty thing like Soapcase broken when i i left for airport in the hotel car...huh..however i had give bond of 50,000 RP (5 AUD) for adaptor they never bothered to mention about it.

294,Good place & Great people!,40,November 2014,"We had a nice stay (4 nights) in The Alea Hotel. It's very clean and everyone is very friendly. The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast is oké. Furthermore, the service is great. For example, they send some postcarts for us, and we only had to pay for te stamps. The location of the hotel is oké. It's near by the beach (when you go to the right), it's just a 10 / 15 minute walk to Potato Head (the most beautiful beach club I have ever seen) and to Salty Seagull (if you like to party, you have to go there). For Seminyak Beach you can better take a taxi or walk on the beach. Furthermore, a 'beach walk' to Echo Beach is a very nice thing to do. Don't forget to make a pit stop at Old Man's!",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
295,Simple hotel just off the track,30,October 2014,"Nice simple hotel with lovely rooms just five minutes walk from the quiet Catina beach. This is a new hotel so i would tell you to be patience. However the staff are very helpful at every step. Breakfast is a plain american, continental or Indonesian affair.

There are two long pools in the middle of the complex and towels are provided.

My stay was pleasant apart from some guests who appeared to do nothing but loiter, stare and make inappropriate comments, from the lobby. I even witness this group making inappropriate statements in Indonesian in regards to a gay couple. I did inquiry as to whether the people were guests and unfortunately were informed they were.
Based on this I can recommend this place for mixed couples and groups but NOT for solo female, group female or gay travellers.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
296,"new nice hotel, but some service improvement needed",40,October 2014,"we booked 2 nights via airasiago for only Rp 350.000 nett per night. its a good bargain for a good, spacious room with lovely decor, powerful shower. we love everything about the room in consideration of the price and they have 2 swimming pools.

My minor complaint is related to the credit card charge, the breakfast and wi-fi. we paid the bill by using credit card and the hotel imposed the 3% fee to us. something never happened to me in hotel in bali, even if its a budget hotel. further they did not issue official receipt /invoice. its just a ""kwitansi"" receipt that you can buy in a market. i dont know whether its a new hotel so they are not ready yet, but dont you think even a new hotel should well prepare everything when they open the hotel for public.

the breakfast, they did not provide buffet breakfast. they gave list of breakfast that we can choose. we chose american breakfast for day 1, its enough to fill our stomach in the morning. they provide 2 eggs, 4 pcs sausages, toast and tasty sautee potato, and 1 glass of juice of our choice. its ok and make our belly happy. but the issue was on the second day, we ordered the same menu, but on the second day, they only provide 2 pcs sausage, LoL, inconsistent service. minor thing but suddenly it makes us questioning their kitchen service quality.

wi-fi, they provide wi-fi but its really lousy connection. and another thing is, mobile connection inside the room is really awful. i dont know why but signal reception inside the room is really bad.

however, overall i really like this hotel, clean and spacious. they should improve some services as i believe they just need good marketing to promote this hotel.",The Alea Hotel Seminyak
