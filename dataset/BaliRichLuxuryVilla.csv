0,DO NOT GO HERE,10,May 2023,"Absolutely disgusted. Got off our flight and arrived at the villas, only to be met with the reception being all mouldy and furniture piled up everywhere. The second we walked into the villa we were horrified. The walls were rotting, the couches were both covered in stains. Went to sit on the bed, only to see stains and dirt all over them. The bathroom had a hole in the ceiling which was dripping on the floor, the toilet didn’t flush, the bath was mouldy as well as the shower.

My partner and I went to the reception to complain, who then put us on the phone to the manager who told us there was nothing he could do, and wouldn’t provide us with a refund and wouldn’t provide reason for it. he said that for 2 days we would have to stay in that villa, and then we would be moved to another villa. when we asked if that villa would be well maintained he couldn’t give an answer.

we went back to the villa to figure out what to do, where the staff the changed our sheets, which were replaced with even more dirty sheets. all the staff could say was that the villas are old and run down and there was nothing they could do.

overall, if i could give this zero stars i would. the whole experience was horrible. we ended up leaving after an hour and staying in a much nicer place for much the same price. DO NOT stay here. not at all worth the money, and the photos online DO NOT match what is in person",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
1,DIRTIEST HOTEL IN BALI,10,May 2023,STAY AWAY. Please other reviews this place needs shutting down. Total SCAM. Looks nothing like the photos. Room was disgusting and dirty. So bad we have had to move to another hotel and pay again. Tried to get a refund from the manager but he is behind the whole scam and won't help.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
2,Nuclear disaster,10,March 2023,"Post apocaliptic experience. Avoid this place its a complete rip off!

Nothing looks like as on the website. Dirty, demolished, pool is full of chemicals.

This place does not comply with health regulations.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
3,Worst Experience Ever!!!,10,December 2022,"It’s a scam!!!!

Toilet choke, power trip, no water heater, dirty, stained on the bedsheets, crack bathtub,

Water problem and you could just buy the mineral waters to take a shower.
Skip this villa at all cost.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
4,Worst experience on holiday in 30 years so thank you Agoda and Bali Rich Villas.,10,December 2022,"BALI RICH 'LUXURY' VILLAS IS THE WORST VILLA ON BALI!

Damp mouldy walls. Dangerous wiring exposed to leaking roofs. Filthy toilets. Even filthier kitchen pans.
Tried two villas, bedroom air-cons junk in both. Left at great cost and inconvenience.
Incredibly this remains an Agoda Preferred Property. Agoda has some beautiful photos of the place but the grim reality is much different.
Hundreds of good reviews from 2010 to 2018 - hundreds of dire and scathing reviews from 2018 to present.
After 40+ glorious trips to Bali, Agoda and Bali Rich Villas ruined this and cost me thousands (pounds not rupiah)
Avoid this villa at all costs and don't be fooled by Agoda's preference or photos!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
5,Absolutely disgusting and filthy villa and disgusting owner,10,November 2022,"Absolutely disgusting. Checked out 30min after checking in. Wires exposed all over the property and I have kids with me. Bed sheets were not replaced by previous guests. Spoke to owner and advised he will change tommrow and wanted me and my kids to sleep in the bed for the kid with stains from other people in it. No covid measures whatsoever. Leaking aircon, tables not wiped, toilets and bathroom filthy. Pool not safe or clean to swim in, broken tiles all around. Entire hotel smells like mould. Told owner I will not stay in the hotel and he couldn’t care less and made no effort to rectify problems. This is not a villa. Photos are at least 20 years old. How TA even allow them to use photos this old is beyond me.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
6,Great Stay,50,September 2022,"My second stay at Bali Rich Villas, lovely Villas in good accessible location in Seminyak, nice large villa with lovely large private pool,and gardens very friendly helpful staff, great value for money generally excellent only comment bathroom good do with a little TLC bathroom need a little refurbishment but all in all excellent property highly recommend anybody to stay here great location and great value for money",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
7,Disgusting villas. Misleading photos.,10,November 2022,"I was disappointed to find the property is extremely run down and doesn't look like the pictures in your website. Even the lady on reception admitted the photos being used online are old and pre-pandemic.

When I arrived it was raining and there was a crackling electrical wire near a pool of water. Definitely unsafe and made me want to leave immediately. It is infuriating finding out the property uses old photos and then refuses to refund. I offered to stay one night and then leave the next day but the manager was awful.

Initially I was given a villa that was so disgustingly dirty that I asked for a refund. The manager advised I would not get a refund if I left so I didn't want to lose my money. The lovely receptionist offered me a villa change on the 2nd day.

The bathtub was filthy. The toilet seat was so disgusting and took 3 turns to make the toilet flush as there was such little water pressure. The shower was filthy and the pool was dirty.

Dirty terrible towels that are stained and look disgusting. Actual brown stains on the towels!!! The shower sometimes has decent pressure and sometimes is barely usable.

The pool in the villa is dirty, the taste is disgusting, there is mold and broken tiles around the pool.

Inside the villa it looks like it hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The smell is terrible and there are a lot of mosquito's around the room so you end up constantly spraying airfreshener or mosquito spray.

The glassware is dirty. There are limited plates and cups. The bathroom has lots of cigarette butts on the rocky floor. Not that hard to clean up.

There are water leak stains on the ceiling and walls. It really looks disgusting. There is a hole in the bathroom ceiling.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
8,Disappointing and definitely not a luxury Villa,10,October 2022,"From the moment I arrived at this property I was disappointed. At the time of booking it showed you were able to check in from 2pm only to have to wait 2 hours until the Villa was finally ready. The property is very run down throughout. There lobby roof is very damaged and mouldy. The villa itself is very basic with no real amenities other than a pool and two towels. After spending 4 hours here I ended up leaving and moving to a hotel.

Staff were not polite and very unhelpful.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
9,Disgusting place,10,October 2022,"honestly the worst place I have ever stayed out in my life, no one really spoke English, there was no pans or any cups or anything for me to cook anything, Staff was laughing at me and money got stolen",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
10,SCAM!! DO NOT GET THIS VILLA UNDER ANY AND ALL CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!,10,October 2022,"Hello folks!

I have the dishonor of presenting the WORST GODFORSAKEN VILLA ON GOD’S GREEN EARTH!!!

I arrived for an anniversary with my girlfriend. Lo and behold, this little-more-than-an-outhouse “villa” not only didn’t look like it’s photos on Agoda (never knew villas could catfish too), the place was absolutely filthy!

Floors covered in dust, rooms infested with mosquitoes, BROWN WATER in the tub with, brown dirty towels and a private pool that was more like a cesspool.

On top of that, after complaining about all of this to the goddamn manager, he expected us to stay in that malarial death-trap for one night before getting us a new one.

How’s that for service recovery folks?

Oh wait, but that’s not all! When asked to refund me, this worthless establishment and the people working there refused to do the decent thing of giving me back my money over an issue THEY CAUSED!

On top of that, they caused me to spend more money than I intended too because we had to get a new hotel.

Worst of all was how my girlfriend had to go through this nightmare on what was supposed to be a special holiday.

To their very very limited credit, they offered me a new room. But that was a whole 24 hours after I walked out.

In short:

THIS PLACE AND IT’S PEOPLE ARE AN APOCALYPTIC JOKW! IF YOU VALUE YOUR SAFETY, SANITY AND WALLET, AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!

A BACKPACKER’S INN IS BETTER THAN THIS!!!

PS: The people who own this place need to have the stupid slapped out of them. They deserve none of their 4 stars.

PPS: AGODA is about as useless as trying to put out a fire with gasoline in this situation. The moment the s*** hits the fan, it’s “we tried our best but it’s out of our hands”. They really don’t care about you as a customer. Trust me, when you go with Agoda, on if the biggest travel e-commerce sites in the world, you’re on your own after they take your money.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
11,Terrible experience,10,September 2022,"Unfortunately, there is not one good thing I can say about our stay. We left the next morning. There was not a clean sheet in the villa, nor was there a fridge. The outdoor area was covered in cigarettes and the indoor area was run down, dirty, and even came with some left over chicken wings on the floor by the bed and some friendly silverfish in the bed on the very yellow, stained bed sheet. The property did not have a restaurant or other amenities as stated and we were not informed of this prior to our stay, Despite this, they were lovely enough to keep our full payment and not offer a different villa or refund.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
12,DO NOT STAY HERE,10,July 2022,"DO NOT STAY HERE! It is nothing like the website - it is disgusting, dirty and unhygienic.
Imagine getting off a flight going to your 2 bedroom villa to find both rooms have dirty sheets with stains, hair and a face mask, the bathrooms are mouldy, tap doesn't work, the cupboard is covered in ants, the other room has a strong paint smell and the owner won't refund you.
I urge everyone to avoid this place and report them. I am happy to send pictures to prove it. So disgusting.
I have reached out to the owner (who lives in Jakarta) for a refund three times and he won't provide it.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
13,DO NOT STAY HERE - SEE PHOTOS,10,April 2022,"DO NOT STAY HERE. I do not say this lightly. The photos are a scam and you will not get what you pay for. See photos.

Everything was in disrepair. Everything was dirty. Towels, sheets, toilet, bath. See photos. No exaggeration.

No chance of refund. This place is a scam. Beware",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
14,Cheap private villa in Seminyak,40,June 2021,"All staff very quick response and very helpful but need improvement regarding cleaness in this villa but overall this is the best choice if you want to stay longer in Seminyak Bali because the price is cheaper compare with the other villa with the same facility,,this is a large villa with private pool and kitchen stuff,this villa provide 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom,,,the location is strategic,you can find food street,shop and mall closer with this villa only walking a few minutes,,also this villa provide parking area for car and motorcycle and easy access going to this villa because location close by main road,,,the last and most important is cheaper,you can save your budget if you choose to stay in here 😁",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
15,Disappointed and out of pocket..,10,April 2020,"Really disapointed with our experience with Bali Rich Villa. Having contacted them in Feb before our booking in April, we were told that our booking could not be refunded or credited even during a global pandemic. As we had paid for 8 nights in advance, this was extremly disappointing that the property was unwilling to make any arrangements or be flexible with this booking. We were really looking forward to staying here during our first Bali holiday. Safe to say that we will not be using this property for any future bookings.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
16,Excellent,50,January 2020,"My wife and I stayed here for 8 nights it was truly amazing , the Villa and private pool were beautiful it was quiet the breakfast was great and the staff were super friendly and helpful, a small supermarket about 4 doors down the road. A safe money exchange about 6 doors up the road and a $3.00 cab ride into Kuta for some amazing restaurants and bars. We will certainly stay here again on our next trip to Bali. Andrew and Jennifer",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
17,Breakfast option is limited to choice of one and it's so pathetic,10,December 2019,"Hi,

We are currently staying at this hotel and when we went for the breakfast, we were being told that out of 10 options we can just select one which generally had omelette or French toast or cereal, we can just choose one. We are feeling very cheated as generally breakfast is not supposed to be limited to choice of one.

This management of breakfast is pathetic and generally pathetic. Please don't book this hotel or you will end up eating only omlette even after paying so much.

Thanks
Rohit",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
18,Luxury at a backpacker price!,50,November 2019,"The week I spent at Bali Rich was just that, rich. Rich with luxury, rich with tropical oasis, rich with great service and then they went and delivered a birthday cake and sang me happy birthday!
This little piece of paradise met all of my expectations and happy hour cocktails are great. If you are looking for a friendly stay just a stones throw from the bustle of Seminyak, then you could go a long way to find something that would lack the atmosphere created by these wonderfully happy staff.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
19,Fabulous stay!,50,October 2019,"My husband and I stayed here for 23 days in a one bedroom deluxe villa. What a stay !
Our first night there was an issue which the staff were very quick to rectify.
The villa itself is amazing with a large bedroom and a really spacious bathroom with a bath and a shower that can have the door opened while you shower giving you an outside shower feel. There is plenty of storage space so it was great to unpack and have everything away.
The pool is fantastic. Much bigger than a plunge pool and definately don’t have to worry about privacy as there is a huge fence that you cannot see over.
The location of the villas itself is on the other side of Sunset Rd and was abit worried about where it was. No need to worry. Crossing Sunset Rd to get into Seminyak was easy and if you dont want to walk, the staff would call a cab for you. There is also a supermarket on the corner of Sunset Rd which was really convenient.
Mertanadi Street has some great places to eat and nice and close if you don’t want to go to far to eat.
Lastly the staff are wonderful here. They always greet you with a smile and always go out of their way to try and help you.
Thank you for a fantastic stay.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
20,"Okay, but far from 'Luxury'",30,October 2019,"We booked a one week stay at Bali Rich in a 'deluxe' room. Upon arrival late at night, we were kindly greeted by welcoming staff and walked down the pathway to the villa at the very back. The distance didn't bother us, but we were a little underwhelmed at the state of the room. There was dirty mirrors, lights not working, stains on the walls, a dirty pool and dated furniture. To add to all this, the (extremely noisy) Air Conditioners hadn't been turned on, and the villa was oppressively hot (keep in mind it was late at night, so we were pretty keen to get to bed).
The next morning, my partner asked if there was any better rooms available, as the one we were given also didn't match the photo online. The staff kindly obliged, and moved us to a much nicer, bigger villa with a much better floorplan and larger pool. The manager kindly came past and double checked everything was ok with the new room, and was very concerned with the comfort of our stay.
Overall, I'd summarise by saying Bali Rich villas are definitely not luxury and are in desperate need of a major renovation. The one saving grace though, is the staff. You're always greeted by a smile and a hello, and they helped us whenever we needed it. It's just such a pity the same isn't invested in the state of the villas.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
21,Ms,50,October 2019,"Everything was fabulous! Clean, roomy, comfortable accommodation with a private pool. It is quiet and well located with only a $A5 taxi ride or 20 minute walk to central Seminyak and beaches.So incredibly restful. The staff are very pleasant and helpful without being intrusive. We would come again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
22,We didn't want to leave!,40,August 2019,"We absolutely loved our stay here! We had the same (2 bdrm) villa as the terrible review below and yes, we did wake up to bat poo on the outside lounger and some leaking from the bidet but every morning the staff would come and clean it, so no worries! We loved the staff, the location, the villa, the tv, the pool, the service and the food - one day we ordered too much (they have an extensive menu!) and when the staff came to clear up and saw that we'd left some food they were really concerned that we hadn't liked it - we had to convince them that we'd loved it all but had just been greedy! :) We'll definitely be back!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
23,Amazing rooms,40,February 2019,This hotel is perfect choice for honeymoon couples. Their rooms are just amazing with private pool. We booked a villa with private pool which was really stunning. Their rooms are best for quality time. They serve breakfast in your room.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
24,Honeymoon,40,August 2019,"We stayed in Bali rich villas for a few nights on our honeymoon before we moved on to nusa dua, the villa is in a good location about 10 min walk from bars and restaurants, 3 min walk from naughty Niro’s which is no1 on trip advisor in seminyak, the villa itself was a brilliant size and pool was perfect, it needs a bit of tlc some paintwork new netting etc,
The breakfast was lovely and a good selection, staff friendly and very helpful: would stay again",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
25,False advertising,10,August 2019,"DO NOT stay at this hotel. We left after 2 days as we couldn't stand it anymore. It is disgustingly filthy and old. It is most definitely not a 4 star hotel as advertised. Scraping to be a 3 star at the most.
Sheets and towels were all stained with brown and grey. Toilet area was leaking water and was not fixed even after asking. Animal waste was all over the living area outside so there was no where to sit except the mosquito ridden bedroom as the bench was also broken.
The aircon remote didn’t work so we froze the first night there. Fridge was disgusting and had dirt and hair in it.
Villa was covered in rust, mould and peeling paint.

Horrible hotel and giving Bali a bad name.

Staff were nice however who ever is managing this hotel needs to shut it down, redo it completely and then reopen it.
It is not fit for tourists.

There are much cleaner and nicer places to stay for less money than Bali Rich Luxury Villa.
This villa is not luxury at all.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
26,Amazing staff,50,August 2019,"Our first time to Bali was a bit of a culture shock from the airport to our accommodation. Once we arrived at the villas, we were more at ease.
There was security at the front gate (appears to be during the day until late at night). The most friendly, polite and accommodating people greeted us at check-in and showed us to our one bedroom villa. The room and pool were perfectly clean. Unfortunately the room we were issued didn't have a sofa bed as advertised however the beds were insanely huge. Other than that, our stay was perfect. I must admit I didn't have the highest of expectations due to reading previous reviews, but Bali Rich did not disappoint.
One thing I will mention, it is very quiet & peaceful so If you're looking to interact with others and meet new people, you're better off elsewhere. These villas would be most suited for couples or families that are wanting to be away from busy Seminyak - in saying that, it's only a 15 min walk to the main streets. The villas also provide a complimentary shuttle around the Seminyak region.
Lastly, do yourself a favour and eat from their restaurant.
Not many people appeared to during our visit (unless they ordered room service) but they had the best satay, hands down.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
27,Don't Bother!,10,July 2019,"We stayed here for 2 nights end of July and if we hadn't have prepaid the whole stay we would have changed hotels!

The villas are just disgustingly dirty! The pillows and bedsheets were so stained I felt disgusted and wanted to throw up. Housekeeping were called to come change them and upon telling staff member that it was gross, her response was 'ok'. Not a sorry or apology in sight.

I know this is not a luxury hotel but at the bare minimum clean unstained bed linen and pillows should be provided. There's no way housekeeping cannot notice this when cleaning rooms. It shows a complete lack of regard for guests and so unhygienic. The towels provided were so stained too, it was ridiculous.
The mosquito net around the bed was so stained, even the part above the bed. See attached photos for proof of stains.

Upon checkout they don't even bother asking how was your stay, as I'm sure they know this is a terrible place!

If you're thinking about staying at this place, please don't! All the bad reviews are very much true.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
28,"Great location, friendly staff",40,July 2019,"Upon arriving the staff were absolutely lovely, greeting us with beautiful smiles & a nice cool drink, they made sure we were shown around the Villa before we settled in for our 10 day stay.
The Villa was comfortable with everything we needed, we loved waking up to the view of the pool & garden.
The courtesy vehicle offered came in handy on hot days when we needed to go somewhere & didn’t want to walk.
The Spa was lovely although some relaxing music would have been nice.
Overall we had a lovely stay but feel that there were some low points & for $180 a night we expected a bit more.
The Villa could do with some maintenance, the step tiles in the pool are broken & could easily injure someone.
The Linen, towels & Mosquito Net over the bed need to be changed as they are stained & grey in colour instead of white.
The Spa in the room needs resurfacing, as it looks dirty & worn, we felt it looked unclean so never used it which was upsetting.
The furniture in the Villa & Pool side are well worn & stained, which is unsightly.
The Hairdryer in the bathroom is melted on one side & I was hesitant to use it.
Again, for $180 a night we expected a lot more.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
29,Excellent Villas very friendly staff and Great Value for Money !!!,50,July 2019,"Very lovely villas, excellent very friendly staff nice villas with large pool and gardens very spacious and relaxing and represent excellent value for money
I would highly recommend these villas very nice large pool, nice garden, very clean, friendly and helpful staff nothing to much trouble nice breakfast every morning and they are excellent value for money",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
30,Loved our stay,40,June 2019,My family and I had wonderful time at Bali Rich. The villa was excellent value. Beautiful rooms and surrounds. Some small maintenance issues - but were attended to promptly by the outstanding and super friendly staff. Villa is very well located. Close to great food / shopping options... and local beaches. We especially enjoyed staying in and lounging by the pool. Would definitely come again!!,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
31,"Fourth Time, Looking Forward To The Fifth And Sixth Next Year",50,May 2019,"Apologies, this is a VERY long review, 3,599 words – we look forward to the novel being published soon. But we think if you are going to spend thousands on a holiday you want to make an informed decision. If you don’t, just read the short review. That is, we’ve just had our fourth stay at Bali Rich, and we’ll be back again twice next year. It is the best value we’ve found in Bali. That’s our short review.

If you are still reading, first things first. We have absolutely no commercial relationship with Bali Rich. We are just a retired and semi-retired couple from a country town south of Perth, and we are happy to do what we can to promote Bali Rich, because we love the place, because we love the people, and because the owner and the staff work very hard to deserve good reviews. It’s as simple as that.

So, our fourth visit to Bali Rich Villas – 2016, 2017, 2018, now 2019. Another planned for next March, another for the following September. We’ve stayed in one-bedroom villas and two-bedroom villas, and we wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Bali. Obviously we love the place, we keep on coming back, and we give it rave reviews every time. What can we possibly say this time that we haven’t said before?

Well, after a conversation with an Australian woman in a Seminyak bar, how about we provide a checklist of what you should be looking for in a villa? That is, what she didn’t look for. Because this very unhappy woman had rented an expensive villa, she didn’t really research it before she booked, she was handed the key when she arrived, and that was it – all she got was the villa. No staff, no breakfast, no security and, when she needed it, no maintenance. In contrast, Bali Rich offers not only very big and very private pool villas, but also all of the staff and facilities offered by a good hotel. So if you are considering booking a private pool villa for your holiday, let’s take a look at what should be on your checklist.

• A very big villa of about 100sqm+ (175sqm for the two-bedroom villas) with a massive bathroom (or two), some with spa baths, a 150sqm walled garden with a wall of at least two metres for absolute privacy, and a 7-8m pool - perhaps 25-30sqm in area, two-bedroom villa pools are generally bigger than one bedroom, but all are long enough to do laps. Note these are my estimates, I didn’t go around measuring up the joint.

• 24 hour reception with the best, friendliest, most helpful staff you could ever want to meet – staff who will bend over backwards to help you and make your stay even better, as we’ve found on a number of occasions.

• 24 hour manned security and CCTV, for real peace of mind.

• A very good on-site restaurant open from 7.00am to 11.00pm, and providing room service for the same hours.

• An on-site maintenance team keeping the swimming pools and villas well maintained, seven days a week. We are extremely impressed by the owner’s ongoing maintenance program and general improvement of Bali Rich - we have noticed improvement every year.

• A great location off Jalan Mertanadi, just north of Sunset Road, close to plenty of restaurants for all budgets, good shops (much cheaper than central Seminyak), a decent supermarket 300m away on the corner of Sunset Road, and heaps of convenience stores within 50-200m.

Now for a little more detail about the benefits Bali Rich offers. It’s a lot to read, but it may make the difference between a great holiday and an average holiday for you, so we encourage you to read on. We also strongly encourage you to write and ask us anything you like about Bali Rich, we are more than happy to answer your questions with complete honesty.

Value

This is a tough one – what should you pay? Looking at the various internet sites, rates go up and down like a yo-yo, and some of them are quite ridiculous. We’ve just seen a site advertising a one-bedroom villa at Bali Rich for almost $500 a night, when Bali Rich’s own website shows about $160! Of course, that’s non-refundable, if you want to be able to cancel at the last minute you’ll pay a lot more. We would say anything under $160 a night for a one-bedroom villa or $240 a night for a two-bedroom villa, including breakfast and airport transfers, is a good deal. You may even be able to negotiate paying a big deposit rather than the whole amount up front, but we don’t know for sure. The bottom line is don’t pay too much for anything, whether it is Bali Rich or anywhere else, and negotiate the best deal you can! But checking the internet, we would say that $160 or $240 is big bang for your buck, with big pools, huge rooms, real gardens, full hotel facilities, and from what we’ve seen, far and away the best value in Seminyak.

The Villas

We’ve stayed in one and two-bedroom villas, and both types are huge, the high-bamboo-ceilinged bedrooms are about eight metres square, the bathrooms about eight metres by four – we could fit about eight of our home bathrooms into them. The bedroom in the one-bedroom villa may be a little bigger than the bedrooms in the two-bedroom villas – we’re just not sure, but that’s the impression we have. Some villas have big stone baths, some have huge spa baths – we can’t be sure which have which, or even if the stone baths have been replaced with spa baths, as they seem to be upgrading all the time. All villas have enormous walk-in showers with a door out to the pool area, and twin sinks and big mirrors in each bathroom. There’s also a tricky thing with the wardrobes, which have doors at the front to the bedroom, and at the back to the bathroom – so you can dress in either room. Too clever.

The major difference between the one and two-bedroom villas is that the lounge, dining and kitchen area is inside the villa in the one bedroom, but outside in the two-bedroom, by the pool. Something else about the two-bedroom villas that we hadn’t thought of until our daughters stayed with us this year is that the two sides of the villa are identical, two massive bedrooms, two massive ensuite bathrooms – so if you are sharing as two couples, no arguments, both sides are exactly the same, just mirror reversed. Our daughters expected their bedroom to be smaller than ours, and expected to share our bathroom – not the case, they had their own self-contained space. Thankfully.

All bedrooms have a flat screen television, cable TV and a DVD player – when our DVD player didn’t work well with a dodgy Bali pirate DVD the player itself was replaced with a brand new player, literally within five minutes of us mentioning it to reception. The beds are enormous, Super King or whatever, and very comfortable. The pillows are big and fluffy – too big and fluffy for us, but that’s personal taste. Every bedroom has a safe tucked away in the more than adequate wardrobes, and a writing desk and chair, and a TV unit, and bedside tables and lights. The lighting could be brighter throughout the villa, but that’s no deal breaker.

Kitchens are well equipped with a big refrigerator / freezer, plenty of cupboard space, a gas cooking range, cutlery and cooking utensils, a toaster, and a big water dispenser which dispenses cold, room temperature and hot water. The kettle in our last villa was the slowest I’ve ever known – but hey, we were on holiday, who gives a stuff? The lounge suite is big and comfortable, great for lying around with a good book outside but under shade in the two-bedroom villas, the dining table is more than big enough, and all villas have sun lounges and huge umbrellas in a big area of lush lawn by the pool.

The pools themselves are well lit at night, both externally (from the garden) and within the pool, and feature a waterfall. Don’t be fooled into taking a villa elsewhere with a plunge pool, it’s just not the same – the pools at Bali Rich are real swimming pools, seven or eight metres long, three or four metres wide, with gentle steps and a sitting area at the shallow end, and 1.5m deep at the deep end. Trust us on the plunge pools – we’ve made that mistake before, what looked like a nice (and expensive) pool villa in Kuta turned out to have nothing but a tiny, hot courtyard and a two metre square plunge pool, and it simply wasn’t pleasant to spend time outside.

Every room – bedroom, bathrooms, and the lounge / dining / kitchen in the one-bedroom villas – has a separate airconditioner, and we suspect these have been upgraded since our first stay. They were adequate then, and extremely effective now, making the villa a real escape from the heat of the day.

Restaurant

The on-site restaurant seems to have improved every year – it was always good, now it is very good, particularly in the size of the servings! We strongly advise that you include breakfast in your package, a great choice of about 20 breakfasts on the menu, ranging from Full English to a delicious Indonesian chicken noodle soup called Mie Ayam Pangsit. All breakfasts are served with fruit juice, enough tea or coffee for two cups each, and a big plate of fresh fruit – all delivered to your villa within a few minutes of you phoning through the order. We suspect if you wanted a different breakfast to order they would provide it – certainly when we asked them to throw in an extra hash brown or whatever, or another pot of coffee, they did so free of charge.

Just one thing – if you like your toast more well done than most Indonesians consider toast should be, don’t waste four years, like we did, asking for well done, or very brown, or very dark – we learned this year that the correct term is crispy!

A very good restaurant on site means very good room service too – the only problem being that the servings were enormous, we really struggled to finish it. But it was delicious, so we gritted our teeth and got through it all.

We were a little concerned on our first visit that Jalan Mertanadi was on the ‘wrong’ side of Sunset Road, but as it turns out the location is fabulous, and getting better every year as Jalan Mertanadi turns into something of an Eat Street. We haven’t visited all of the eating places, there would have to be 15-20 on Jalan Mertanadi alone, but among those we’ve tried there are two brilliant cheap restaurants (Duck Duck Goose and Warung Mak Oni) within 100m of Bali Rich, the rather flash French L’Assiette perhaps 150m away, the classy but inexpensive Japanese / Fusion Rakuen Asia 250m south (by which time you are almost down to Sunset Road and the panoply of restaurants on the other side), the horribly touristy Gusto Gelati 100m north (okay if you want to queue for ice cream, we can’t be bothered with that nonsense), the equally horribly touristy Naughty Nuris 300m north (busloads of Chinese queue on chairs in the car park waiting to eat pork ribs with the rest of the lemmings – really?). Better to walk past Naughty Nuris another 150-200m or so, (on reflection, we shouldn’t be too critical, it’s worth a visit when there are no queues) and you get to our new all-time favourite restaurant, Ingka – a bit of Japanese, a bit of everything else, cheap and very good sushi, don’t miss out on the $2 salted edamame beans, our new addiction, the whole place is just fabulous, we love it to death.

But if you are not satisfied with the offerings close to Bali Rich, the real Eat Street (Jalan Kayu Aya) is a $1.20 taxi away if you are a miser and you hail the taxi on the street and you don’t give a tip. But a better way is to get reception at Bali Rich to call a taxi for you, it’s generally there in five minutes or so, it is always a Bluebird Taxi so nobody will try to rip you off. Because it is ordered you’ll pay a minimum of Rp30,000 (about $3) which will get you anywhere in Seminyak – but look, even if we hail a taxi on the street we’ll pay Rp30,000, although the meter may only say Rp12,000, it’s only fair. If you hail, a taxi on the street and the driver doesn’t put the meter on and quotes $5 or $10 to get you home from anywhere in Seminyak, tell them to get stuffed and get out of the taxi – there’ll be an honest driver along within seconds!

Also within a $3 taxi ride – although it’s actually not too far to walk – is the best supermarket in the area, Bintang, and the most trusted money changer, BMC. Our advice is to get to both on your first day – take a taxi to BMC Money Changer just past Bintang supermarket, change what you need, then cross the road and turn right, Bintang is 50-100m on your left, to stock up on your snacks and booze and essential bits and pieces.

However, if you want to do it closer to home, walk to the corner of Jalan Mertanadi and Sunset Road, turn left and there’s a Central Kuta money changer (highly reputable) within 100m, then backtrack and there’s a reasonable supermarket just the other side of Mertanadi, past the bread shop and burger joint. But be warned – if we are talking about stocking up as an Australian, Bintang has a much better range of alcohol.

The beach is probably a $3 taxi too, but we really have no idea – we’re in a private pool villa, we can order room service cocktails delivered to the villa within a few minutes, or drink our el cheapo Robinson’s spirits and mixers from Bintang, so why on earth would we want to battle crowds and put up with sand in our bathers? But if the beach is your thing, $3 should do it – it’s only 1.5km as the crow flies.

As for further afield – we felt the need to go to Kuta once, as we wanted our daughters to experience Bamboo Bar and Boardwalk Restaurant, and the taxi was well under $10 including a generous tip. But had our daughters not been with us we would not have bothered, everything we need is in Seminyak.

Negative Reviews

We can’t finish this review without covering some of the things said in the occasional negative review of Bali Rich. Some people really make us angry.

Firstly, we would have to say that the negative reviews may come from people who have paid far too much – if you are particularly stupid it is quite possible to pay $400-500 a night for any villa in Seminyak, and as we said, we feel $160 a night is value. If the negative reviews don’t come from people who have paid too much, they come from people whose expectations are too high, or people who are simply tossers. Maybe they are just too miserable to enjoy holidays, because people like that find something to whine about everywhere they go. Chillax, dudes!

Having said that, some criticisms are legitimate, even though they are, in our view, not worth worrying about, let alone writing about. We cover them only because we would hate anyone to book based on our glowing review, then be disappointed.
Peeling paint. Yes. From memory, we believe there may have been a bit of peeling paint in every villa we have stayed in – not just Bali Rich, but another in Seminyak, one in Kuta, and two in Jimbaran. A humid atmosphere when villas are unoccupied and cold airconditioning when they are occupied will do that to paint, and it’s hard to keep on top of it. And we also don’t think the painters are necessarily up to scratch. No, let’s extend that. Coming from Australia, we don’t think the painters, or the carpenters, or the plumbers, or the electricians, or any tradies are up to scratch anywhere in South East Asia. We don’t know how lucky we are – standards simply aren’t the same. So add to a bit of peeling paint the odd ill-fitting cupboard door and Heath Robinson electrical or plumbing connection. Then get over it.

Pool dirty and green. Of course it is, but only if you let it get that way – you must keep the chlorine up, and have the pool cleaned every day, particularly if you are using the pool a lot. Ask, and it’s done. But if you forget to have pool maintenance done for a couple of days, it will go green very quickly, it will have to be superchlorinated, and you won’t be able to use it for a day. How do we know? We know because even though this was our fourth time in Bali Rich we forgot to have pool maintenance done for a couple of days, and it went green very quickly, and we couldn’t use the pool for a day. Anyway, we made that stupid mistake, so you don’t have to. And it’s not Bali Rich’s fault, reception asked if we wanted the pool cleaned, we just pushed our luck because we didn’t want to be disturbed, just like the sign on the gate said.

Dirty sheets, walls covered in mould, dirty floors, sewage smell. Oh boy, some people are precious. We have always found the sheets and towels spotlessly clean, but not as pristinely white as they were when they were babies. They are being replaced on an ongoing basis, but sometimes you get something perfectly usable, but a little older. Rejoice when you get the new stock! And if you don’t, just ask for fluffy replacements – they won’t take offence. Walls covered in mould, no, never, not in any of the four villas we have stayed in – unless we don’t know mould when it is staring us in the face. Dirty floors – okay, sometimes the cleaners miss a bit – we know this because the lady half of our two person partnership said ‘oh, they’ve missed a bit’ last time we were there. What we did was wipe it clean ourselves. Radical, eh!

Sewage smell. Come on, what would Bali be without a few smells? It’s Bali! Every hotel smells somewhere, at some time! So yes, occasionally a little on the nose, but only occasionally, and only a little – leave the toilet fan on longer if you are offended.
Geckos in the room, the air was thick with mosquitoes. Geckos? Bali? Who’da thunk it? To the best of our recollection we saw one gecko in the room, we would have preferred one or two more, makes us feel all holidayish, and they don’t attack. Nothing like Jimbaran, our villa there had hundreds of the buggers. Okay, tens. Air thick with mosquitoes? Odd, that review was for the same time we were there, and we generally had only one mosquito in the room, which we kept spraying, but there he was again the next day. Or his replacement. We’ll say again – it’s Bali! Odd that nobody mentioned bats zipping around at dusk. If you have a two-bedroom villa with the outdoor living area, make sure you keep the outdoor roof fan going 24/7 – during the day for a bit of a breeze, and during the night to dissuade the bats from roosting! But again, they don’t attack, and they only seem to be flying around for 15 minutes or so.

Broken blinds. Yes. I suspect the wooden slatted blinds have been there since Bali Rich was built, and they are awful things, notoriously difficult to use, and years and years of hundreds of people twisting the control rods and tugging on the strings has rendered them almost unusable. The good news is that there are not many left, they are all being replaced by far more sensible curtains. For the moment, if you are booked in to a villa which still has wooden blinds on one or two windows, be gentle with them. But they really are useless things, the sooner they are all gone, the better.

So criticism, eh? Like beauty, it’s in the eye of the beholder. Four visits, and we have absolutely no criticisms at all. We love Bali Rich, it’s our home away from home, we always relax and have a great time, we love to be greeted by the same people every time, we’ll never stay anywhere else in Bali, and while nothing is perfect, the good outweighs the less than perfect by a long, long way. For a 100sqm villa with a very private 150sqm walled garden and a 30sqm pool, with the best and most helpful and most willing and most smiley staff in the world, close to great restaurants and a short taxi from anywhere you want to be, at the kind of price most people pay for a 30sqm mid-range hotel room with no privacy and a pool you have to share with the Eurotrash who reserve their prime poolside lounges with their towels at six every morning …. for that, we’ll put up with the little bit of floor the cleaner missed, the occasional threadbare towel, and a gecko or two.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
32,Lovely place to relax in private,50,May 2019,"A great start to our first time in Bali. We prearranged a taxi with them so make the airport pickup easier which was great. Our little villa was lovely, just what we’d hoped for. It was clean, cool and comfortable with everything you needed. The bed had a mosquito net which is always a bonus and was comfy enough. The garden had sun all day long and the pool was great. The villas are totally private with nobody overlooking you and have a doorbell if the staff require access for cleaning etc. The staff were always friendly and even went the extra mile to bring a surprise cake to our room for my partners birthday which was totally unexpected but a lovely touch. There are a few tired looking bits around the villa like the bathroom mirror and maybe some bit of the furniture but for what you paid it’s totally worth it. About 5 minutes walk to the main restaurants/shops area but there is a lovely little place next door called three little ducks that is good for brekky or a light evening meal and super cheap. Thank you for a lovely stay, would stay again if ever back in Seminyak.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
33,Basic and needs updating,20,April 2019,The photos of the Bali Rich villa looked amazing but however this was not reality. The pool was very dirty and we had to ask them to come and get the pump working. It did start working but the water was looking very green which isn’t ideal to swim in. The mirrors in the bathroom were all scratched and the lighting was very poor. The shower nozzle sprayed water everywhere and could not be adjusted. We stayed only 1 night of our intended 4 night stay and booked somewhere else. We were extremely disappointed however the staff were lovely. We didn’t bother complaining as I feel the villa was just not up to a luxury standard as shown in the photos. Would be great if some serious renovations were done. About 10 minute walk to Seminyak Main Street.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
34,Average experience,30,April 2019,"Conceptualky was very good, however since we were with kids could not use the pool as lot of ants and mosquitoes around with lizards and frogs so avoided for kids. Huge rooms huge bathroom. Needs maintenance.
Reception and resto staff were very good.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

37,"Amazing, Wonderful, Brilliant, Pick Your Superlative .... Yet Again",50,August 2018,"Our third visit to Bali Rich in August 2018 was even better than the first two, as we received an upgrade, but we forgot to review it at the time. With our fourth visit coming up in May 2019, time to update the record.

Again, we can’t praise the place highly enough. There is nowhere else we will stay in Bali. If you are paying Aus$160 a night or less including breakfast, Bali Rich is the best value you will find – for many reasons.

First of all, the staff. Simply the best. Genuinely friendly, lovely people who will do anything to ensure your visit exceeds expectations. If anything goes wrong it is fixed, in our experience, within minutes. Order a taxi and it is done immediately, and they appear to only use Bluebird, the most trustworthy company. And they go above and beyond the norm in helping their guests. On our first visit, when I suffered a minor but annoying medical issue and received a specialist referral by email at 4.00am, Shelley forwarded the referral to reception, reception printed it and stayed on the phone to Siloam Hospital until an appointment was confirmed, then provided a car and driver to take us to the hospital, wait for us, and bring us home – free of charge. What kind of a service is that? We have stayed in many, many hotels over the past 37 years, and the staff at Bali Rich are head and shoulders above the best we have ever known. They make a special place even more special.

Secondly, the villas themselves, the piece de resistance. They are not brand new, you may find a couple of minor maintenance issues, such as blown light globes – the electricity system in Bali is one of the most fragile in the world – but so what? Our blown light globes were replaced as soon as we asked for it. And despite the fragile power, in 20 days at Bali Rich we have not experienced a single power cut, or a single WiFi dropout. Everywhere else we have stayed in Bali and Lombok – that’s another seven or eight hotels or villas – we have had power cuts, sometimes for many hours, and in one relatively expensive hotel in Kuta we had power cuts every day, including four in a single afternoon. That’s a real pain when you are trying to watch a DVD, constantly having to go back to find where you were at when the power cut out! I repeat, not a single power cut, not a single WiFi dropout in Bali Rich. It’s important.

But returning to the villas – magnificent. A full 250sqm, which to my eye was 100sqm in the villa, and 150sqm in the garden and pool. The villa is enormous – to one side a massive bathroom, I estimate 7m by 4m, with toilet, one of the biggest baths I have ever seen, a two basin vanity with a big mirror, and a shower bigger than our bathroom at home, with direct access to the garden and pool area. To the other side a 7m by 4m kitchen / dining / lounge, high bamboo ceilings, the kitchen well equipped for basic cooking, two burner stove, heaps of cupboards, a big fridge/freezer, a water dispenser dispensing both hot and cold water, breakfast bar, a lounge suite and coffee table big enough for three or four people, and a wall of glass with sliding doors to the garden and pool. Then between the bathroom and kitchen, the bedroom, again with a full wall of glass and sliding doors to the garden and pool. About 7m by 7m (I know my measurements don’t equate to 100sqm, but they are just guesstimates, I didn’t take a tape measure on holiday), again with high bamboo ceilings, a desk and cupboard on one side, desk, drawers and lots of wardrobe space on the other, a safe in the wardrobes, huge King size bed which seemed bigger than our King size at home, flat screen television, DVD player. The flat screen television was not huge, perhaps 32”, so we moved it as close to the bed as the cords would allow because the room is just so big! The newness of the television, DVD player and fridge/freezer appears to depend on the villa, perhaps they progressively upgrade, because we stayed in two different villas this year – we cancelled our move to another area of Bali, and extended our stay at Bali Rich, changing villas in the process - and the equipment in the second was newer than the equipment in the first. However, it all worked perfectly well in both villas. And finally in regard to the interiors, separate airconditioners for each room, so effective that we occasionally had to turn them off.

On this occasion we were upgraded to a two-bedroom villa, and I didn't take note of the room sizes, but I would say just as big. However, in the two-bedroom villa the kitchen, dining and sitting area were outside by the pool, which made a big difference. Breakfast by the pool every morning was absolute heaven.

These are real private pool villas, with the accent on both the private and the pool. The 150sqm garden (including the pool) is full of tropical greenery and a huge lawned area, immaculately maintained, and surrounded by a wall I estimated to be 2.3m high, so unless the Harlem Globetrotters book in your privacy is absolute. And they would still have to jump to look over the wall. In all three villas in which we have stayed, almost absolute silence, a real oasis away from the noisy Jalan Mertanadi 100m away - and the two-bedroom villa was just as silent as the others, despite being fairly close to reception. I can’t tell you how pleasant it was lying on the sun lounges shaded by an enormous umbrella, a couple of drinks on the table between us, watching the clouds drift by in a blue sky, listening to the bird calls, having a quick swim when we felt energetic enough – we spent hours lazing around doing sweet FA. And while we are not the sunbathing types, if you are you can sunbathe on the lawn, or drag the lounges out into the sun.

Then there is the pool. It is a real pool – and again, don’t be fooled into somewhere advertising as a pool villa which only has a plunge pool, it’s just not the same. We made that mistake twice, a place in south Kuta which gave us a tiny courtyard too hot to sit in, and a 2m square plunge pool useful only for a quick cool-off – Aus$225 a night, and the whole thing would fit three times into the Bali Rich garden and pool area! No, Bali Rich offers a real pool, about 7m by 3m - perhaps a metre either way bigger in the two-bedroom villa - beautiful to look at, perfectly maintained, long enough to swim laps, 1m deep at the shallow end, 1.5m at the deep end, with a waterfall feature in the middle. Nice.

Service to the villas was also top notch. Through our own choice we would only have the room made up and the garden and pool maintained every couple of days, and on days we didn’t need it the staff would always call to ask if we wanted it done – so if you want it done every day, it will be done every day. And what a performance – a small army descends on the villa, one or two doing the garden, one doing the pool, three or four in the villa with different jobs to do, and they do it very effectively. When they leave there are fresh towels throughout, bed made up, used bathroom items replaced, rubbish bins emptied, the pool is immaculately clean, and chlorinated if necessary, the water level is topped up if too much has evaporated, and there’s not a single frangipani blossom left on the lawn.

All of this makes a difference. This huge space makes a difference, and I can’t imagine you would find anything like it for the same money. If you do, let me know. But we’ll still stay at Bali Rich.

Thirdly, Bali Rich is a full service villa complex, about 20-30 private pool villas, with 24/7 reception, 24 hour security, a bar and restaurant open from 7.00am to 11.00pm, room service, breakfast delivered to the villa, staff on hand and available at all times. Don’t make the mistake of renting a villa which is simply a villa, without the full service facilities – we spoke to a couple in a bar in Seminyak who had done just that, and regretted it – driven from the airport, handed the keys and left to it, when something went wrong they couldn’t find anyone to help, and of course, they had to make their own breakfasts or find a local restaurant. Not so at Bali Rich. Talking of restaurants and breakfast – something like 18-20 breakfast choices at Bali Rich, call 116 to order, and it was more often than not delivered to our kitchen and set out on the breakfast bar by the always friendly room service staff in ten minutes. I generally went for the English, two eggs, bacon, chicken sausage, baked beans, mushrooms, grilled tomato, toast, Shelley said the omelettes were pretty good, the Dello Chef on French baguettes was excellent (although I ordered mine without the pineapple, horrible thought). I don’t think I would recommend the Eggs Benedict or Salmon Florentine, simply because the hollandaise on both split on the journey between the kitchen and the villa – but they were both perfectly edible, with plenty of salmon in the Florentine. And on this last occasion I got into a chicken noodle soup, Mie Ayam Pangsit, for breakfast, absolutely addictive. All breakfasts are served with a choice of four fruit juices, a pot of freshly brewed coffee (enough for two cups each), a jug of milk, a plate of jams and preserves and honey, sachets of sugar, salt and pepper, and a plate of fresh fruit, generally four slices of each of three types of melon, with a slice of lime to squeeze over them – try it, really nice! The only problem was the toast – Balinese have no idea how to make toast, we’ve experienced this everywhere we’ve stayed in Bali, so make sure you order your toast very well done, or very brown – but if they still don’t get it right, there’s a toaster in your kitchen to finish it off. As for the restaurant – not bad, but not great, the standard of food (in my limited experience) could be upgraded, but certainly more than adequate for a quick evening room service while you are packing for the morning flight home, and good value for a hotel kitchen.

Unfortunately, like any hotel kitchen in Seminyak, Bali Rich faces too much competition. Eat Street (Rumours, Ultimo), Indian at Gateway of India or Queen’s Tandoor, so many choices, all an Aus$3 taxi ride away. And Jalan Mertanadi, the street on which Bali Rich is located, is also becoming a bit of an Eat Street, probably 20 or so restaurants within walking distance, including Naughty Nuri's for some pretty fine ribs, and Warung Mak Oni, a really good little cafe serving Western and Indonesian food, just 100m away.

To stock up on indulgences to enjoy at the villa, go to the best supermarket and liquor store in central Seminyak, Bintang supermarket, a great range of absolutely everything, including Robinsons spirits - gin, vodka, whiskey, tequila, everything, Aus$16 a bottle, so well worth a visit - and the exchange rate at BMC (also extremely trustworthy, and metres from Bintang supermarket) can be marginally better than Kuta Central, check it on the net before you go. So to get to central Seminyak from Bali Rich if you can’t be stuffed with a 20 minute walk in the heat, too easy – call reception, order a taxi (sometimes you have to wait five minutes for a taxi on Jalan Mertanadi, who can be bothered, and you are guaranteed a Bluebird through reception), it will cost you Aus$3 to anywhere in central Seminyak, and you are there in minutes. Aus$3 is the minimum fare if you book the taxi, but it also turns out to be the maximum to central Seminyak, so you never pay more. If you get a taxi on the street it may only register Aus$1.25-1.50 on the meter, but we always handed over Aus$3 anyway. And there are a few taxis, not Bluebirds, with dodgy meters or drivers who will refuse to turn the meter on and try to charge Aus$5 for an $Aus1.25 trip – just tell them to stop and get out. Returning to Bali Rich from central Seminyak, we never had to wait more than 30 seconds on the street, and generally we would walk straight out of the restaurant into a taxi. I timed it once – from getting up from our table at Rumours, giving the waitress a hug, leaving the restaurant and getting into the taxi, one minute and six seconds. Love it!

Okay, I can’t finish this very long and very positive review of Bali Rich without talking about some of the negative reviews. None of them reflect our experience, some people just don’t seem capable of chilling out on holiday, and complain about the most minor issues. Don’t sweat the small stuff, I say. So let’s take a look at some of the negative comments.

‘Pool water had so much chlorine in it we only used it once!’ I’d rather have too much chlorine than too little – the staff maintain the pools immaculately, which includes making sure the water is safe, and Shelley’s eyes became slightly sore on one occasion, lasting a few minutes, when she swam 50 laps just after pool maintenance – one occasion in 14 days. So what?

‘Grey & musky smelling towels’. Nonsense – towels are always clean and smell fresh, changed every day if you can be bothered, I’ll happily admit some are past their prime, a little threadbare, the occasional small stain, never grey but perhaps a little tired, we had a good laugh when we got a nice fluffy one once, but so what, their purpose is to dry you, and they do that perfectly well – 250sqm, a real pool, heaps of space, and you give Bali Rich a bad review because the towels are not perfect? Give me a break.
You want a good as new towel every day, pay Aus$500 a night for five stars, and seriously, if you expect perfection for Aus$160 a night including a good breakfast, Bali Rich isn’t for you.

‘The staff are rude’. No, I won’t stand for that. This from a couple who both filed a separate poor review, which I thought was a miserable thing to do. If the staff were rude, it must have been because these two whining Poms were rude and demanding too – the staff are superb, and in two visits to Bali Rich we have never experienced anything other than the most helpful, friendly attitude from every member of staff with whom we have dealt. The staff are simply the best, probably the best I have experienced in almost 40 years of visits to Bali.

‘The (toilet) flush is not doing its work, the shower water is not spraying, just dripping’. Ah, here’s a trap for young players. Press the flush on a Western toilet, and it flushes. But with a Bali toilet, you have to hold the button down until the flush has finished – simple, but not simple enough for some, apparently. As for the shower – I agree. Rain showers are an abomination, I can’t stand them, because they are what they say they are – rain showers. The water droppeth as the gentle rain from Heaven (Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice), gentle being the operative word. Absolutely useless things, I have no idea why so many hotels were sucked in to installing them. But what the correspondent conveniently failed to mention is that there is also a hand shower attached, with plenty of pressure – and that Bali Rich provides unlimited supplies of very hot water. From memory, there is also a tap in the shower. If you are going to tell a story, don’t be selective, tell the whole story. There is such a thing as lying by omission.

Having said all of that, there have been fewer and fewer poor reviews, and it may well be that older poor reviews date from two or three years ago when the owner passed away, not difficult to imagine a management vacuum until his wife sorted out the hierarchy – just speculating, but none of the poor reviews reflect our experience. I think we were actually very lucky to make our first booking when management was in transition and prices were very special - if it hadn't been for the promotional prices we may not have made our first booking, and we would have missed out on a gem. We love everything about Bali Rich, and we intend to stay there again and again and again. As I said earlier, the next time is May 2019, we can't wait, and on this occasion we have booked two villas, as our daughters are coming too. And I'm sure they will also become hooked.

Finally – delighted you have had the patience to read this far, I hope you have learned everything you need to know – but perhaps a disclaimer is in order. We have absolutely nothing to do with Bali Rich, we are simply very satisfied guests who have had the most wonderful time staying there on three separate occasions, and who look forward to staying there once or twice a year until we are too old to travel.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

40,Really lovely villa,40,March 2019,"Recently stayed here for 10 days & had a really good stay. Spacious yard area & lovely gardens. Bed was very comfortable & our bathroom was huge with a double sink. Lovely outdoor kitchen & lounge area by the pool with a decent size fridge. Staff were lovely & very helpful. No aircon in the bathroom so it was rather hot getting ready & when the bedroom door to the bathroom was left open to let the aircon in, the bedroom warmed up. Also there wasn't a full length mirror in the villa. Other than that it was gorgeous.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

42,Dated but value for money at discounted rate.,30,February 2019,"Helpful staff, excellent transport. Accommodation is dated and we had issue with taps working and gate lock getting stuck. Clean linen and generally clean although much of the routine maintenance seemed to be slipping. At discounted rate per night it was good value for money, close enough to good shops etc.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
43,Huge private pool villa,30,February 2019,"Huge villa with private pool. The room and premises were kept very clean.

Staff were pleasant and very accommodating.

Location is nice and quiet, only a short walk to Seminyak Square, or approx. 12,000IDR ($1.30 AUD) for a metered cab. Restaurants nearby are super cheap in comparison to the busy / main Seminyak.

Our key negatives to share are the very old, nasty stained towels & a spa bath in the bathroom that we wouldn’t dare touch - both WELL overdue for replacement. Definitely not 4 star for these. Seems general maintenance could do with a little more attention.

Despite the few negatives, we’d still recommend this place mostly due to private pool, staff & location.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
44,Awesome space!,50,February 2019,"A huge outdoor space and the pool was wonderful!
So much space inside although maybe the tv could be a bit bigger to match the size of everything else. Staff kept the villa and pool clean for us every day and were always helpful! Nice and close to main streets of Seminyak and lovely restaurants close by. Was treated to lovely rose petals set up for our honeymoon! Was lovely and quiet but we were visitors during off season ☺️ somewhere I would come back to value for money was great!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
45,Amazing!,50,January 2019,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at Bali Rich Villas and loved every minute of it! Our villa itself was beautiful and the private pool was great. The constant aircon kept us cool at night too. The staff were friendly and helpful and cleaned our room daily. Great location, only a 5 min scooter ride down to the main square of Seminyak! Highly recommend!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
46,Very lovely stay,40,January 2019,"Stay here was very relaxing. Bed was comfortable, facilities were great, staff amazing, food was lovely, grounds were beautiful. Place a little run down eg leaking shower rose, broken tiles in and around pool, our sliding door wouldn’t securely lock I called staff around midnight they came straight away to try fix the problem. Door needed new rollers they weren’t able to fix during our stay. I managed to somehow lift door into a certain position in the end to keep the door locked at night. Everything else was amazing and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Walking distance to Naughty Nuris has amazing food. Easy to get taxi in Street. Mini mart close by and massage. All in all a great experience so thank you Bali Rich Villas",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
47,Ok ok resort,20,January 2019,"I vusured6the resort and stayed there for 3 nights and rang in my new year at the resort
Firstly the ac not working properly inspite of being the monsoon season
The breakfast was not a buffet but fixed menu
That was nothing good to write about
All in all a very very average experience
Which could have been avoided",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
48,Great location and wonderful stay at Bali Rich villas,40,November 2018,"I just returned from a 6 night stay at Bali Rich Villas. Traveled with a girlfriend and we stayed in 2 bedroom villa. Before leaving i saw very mixed reviews about the villas so my expectations were pretty much managed. Upon arrival we saw that some reviews were correct and some did not apply to our villa. For example, bed lined and bath towels were really dated like a lot dated but they smelt and felt quite clean. Cleaning of the rooms while was good yet was not perfect with floors still retaining some dust and debri after a room clean. Pool and day beds are fantastic. Water in the pool clean and at great temperature. Rooms and bathroom are huge. Air con working really well and whilst being a bit noisy I had it on 24/7 while my girlfriend used to switch it off in the mornings and just open the door to the garden area. Room service menu is great and food is very tasty at very good prices. We like our wine so discovered that buying good Aussie wine from South Australia is best done at the mini mart located a few doors down from the villas. For $28 Aussie dollars we had an excellent bottle of wine to sip on by the pool. Staff are amazing and get out of their way to help guests. Very friendly! I asked for an extended check out as my flight was not until 10:20PM so I was offered to pay $90 extra and this included transfer to the airport, which i think was very reasonable. Overall, i have to say that Bali rich charges extremely reasonably for what they have to offer. Its not luxury luxury but a good place to stay if you want to spend your money elsewhere say on dining and entertainment rather than accommodation. Pool are is great and this is what was important to us. I would recommend going there with a bunch of friends as its well located and reasonably priced.

I cannot leave out mentioning restaurants that are nearby and are walking distance (about 10-15 mins) to La Favela and Ku De Ta. We usually like to plan but this time round decided to drop planning and just discover places nearby by just strolling. Lots of great little restaurants around.several times we had breakfast at Duck Duck Goose located a few shops away, had an amazing dinner at ingka restaurant (must visit!) frequented by expats - very reasonably priced and food was so fresh, had breakfast at SOUQ (great long black coffee just like we like it in Australia). Shelter Bali (just google it) is an amazing cafe with fresh and organic food - also a must visit.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
49,Happy,40,November 2018,It has very good service there with also good food but a bit expensive I would recommend for solo people traveling as it would get expensive to stay with a family or a group. The rooms were well furniture too.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
50,One week stay,10,October 2018,"Cons:
-water nozzle mold and old, water dispenser. We didn't use it for health reasons
-airconditioning doenst cool de room.
-room stays at 24 degrees celsius
-the name of the villa doesnt come true
-maintenance of the villas is really bad
-maybe in 2012 it was superb,but since then, is hasnt been maintained
-first we got the wrong room. After half an hour we needed to move out,that was disappointing

Pros:
-fast service by the reception
-24 hour security",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
51,Great,40,October 2018,"Great location, awesome food, and cordial staff. The rooms and bathrooms are huge. The pool is great but should have been heated.
One major problem in this property is that the rooms don't have any fan. So you ll need to use the ac all night. Besides the AC isn't effective enough during the day. So you end up feeling hot. Also, certain lights and pool fountain weren't working. But, the staff fixed them instantly when reported.
Moreover, it's a great place to chill, very good location, away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. Loads of privacy. Nice stay.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
52,Not so rich luxury villas,20,October 2018,"Here it is:
1. I ask for ""happy anniversary"", but it seems like they dont know how to spell it. ""Happy universar"", thats not even a word! Thanks for ruining my anniversary.

2. We ask to move to other rooms because our villa are facing a hotel/dormitory building. They gave us villa no 217, which is not better than the previous one. The AC isnt compatible for the room size! So the temperature inside the villa is so hot! we thru 2 night in this hell! We ended up asking to move to others villa, and they gave us the first villa we've been to.

To be honest this is the worst villa I ever booked in bali.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
53,"Great villa, excellent service",50,October 2018,"Really lovely, helpful people & clean villa - we stayed for our honeymoon and were made to feel very welcome. Room was decorated beautifully. Room service was quick. Room had all that we could have needed/wanted. Thanks so much!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
54,Great service all round,50,September 2018,"We stayed here for one week mid-September and loved it all.

From the moment we arrived staff were courteous and helpful, offering drinks and taking our bags. The room and pool were clean and had everything we needed. Staff gave good suggestions and sorted a car without any hassle at a good price.

At one point the boiler started leaking but they fixed it and cleaned the bathroom within an hour without any hassle.

Cocktails are standard price and great to have them brought to the room. Breakfast was included with our room and well worth it. However we decided to eat out or get Street food and bring it back.

Thanks to Bali Rich for all your help and kindness.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
55,Great time in Bali rich villa,50,September 2018,"My friend and I stayed for 1 week in Bali rich villa and we had a peaceful and cool time there.

People at the réception are really nice and always listening to us. I wanted to thanks Ari at réception, she was always helping us and really nice with us. Thanks also to Suchi for her kindness and her help.

The breakfast was really good too, many choices for the breakfast and really good taste. The staff of thé restaurant is also really good and professional.

Housekeeping was perfect,when we needed them, they always come to clean the room. Thanks to them.

On short we had à great time there
Thanks to all staff

Sofia and Mounia :)",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
56,Pleasant villa,40,September 2018,"We stayed here for 7 nights. I requested a new villa and it was very nice and tidy. I loved the layout and the pool, although we could not tell if it was saltwater or chlorine as it did not smell/taste like either. We had breakfast in our villa every morning which was great, they were very prompt but some were a little impatient ringing the doorbell more than once....let us walk out of the villa first...
It’s a rough 10 min walk to some main areas of Seminyak, 20-25 min to Seminyak square. There’s a Circle K about 5 min walk away. A few restaurants on that road, no shopping. Constantly hearing motorbikes during the day from the villa.
The toilet flush system wasn’t that great, sometimes it wouldn’t flush entirely or would have to wait 15 mins to flush again.
There was one night we wanted extra towels as we were in the villa all day and didn’t have cleaning service. They had no fresh towels left, which we found odd. Should have more than enough towels in this sort of industry.
We had lunch and dinner a few times - mie goreng was really good. My partner loved the Greek salad.
My partner was really sick one night and day from another restaurant in Seminyak. We had a tour booked the following day with a driver picking us up, but we couldn’t get a hold of the company via email to ask about rescheduling. The lady at the front desk rang them for us and rescheduled, which took some stress off our shoulders. We really appreciated that.
One thing we weren’t happy about was on a Sunday morning for a few hours, the use of the Glory Room was incredibly loud. We couldn’t hear our own music in our villa. We were really unhappy we weren’t told this would be happening, otherwise we would’ve gone out for the day. All we wanted to do was relax by our pool, but it really ruined the first half of our day. Please let guests know when this will be happening in future, especially the villas right next to it which we were. I respect religion but I didn’t enjoy the music.
Thank you for a great stay. I recommend Bali Rich Villas.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
57,"Misleading photos, far from reality",10,August 2018,"We arrived at the hotel and the room wasn't ready at 2pm as advertised, we had to wait. Once we got into the room we realised that the bed sheets hadn't been cleaned from the previous guests and had to ask the reception staff for a cleaner to give us some clean sheets. The walls were covered in mould, the bathtub was black, a smell of sewage was coming from the bathroom. The swimming pool was not clean but at this point we were not even bothered about it. We had a non refundable room and couldn't stay another night in such a dirty run down so called luxury 4 star hotel. We complained to the hotel manager who took us to another room (bad damp on the walls and broken mirror in the bathroom which he was very embarrassed about). I understand that this a non refundable room, I am a hotel owner myself but if i advertise false images to my customers and they wish to leave due to me misleading them, i would refund them the room straight away!! There is no point for Bali Rich Villas to respond to this comment by saying ""we are sorry to hear that...."" because I don't want to hear it after them not being bothered to refund us! Also we paid for breakfast but it was not offered to us! NEVER GO THERE, this hotel is a huge rip off and does not deserve 4 stars! we ended up staying at 5 star hotel L Seminyak which was in a better location and far more affordable. Real luxury, clean and staff on demand. For anyone that encounters the same problem with these crooks not wanting to refund them, I suggest you ask your bank to cancel the charge for the room and get your money back via your bank.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
58,Would recommend !!,40,August 2018,"Overall experience:
We stayed here for 7 nights. we booked a double room(basic package) however on arrival it appeared we were upgraded to a nicer room (room 215) with an outdoor setting we weren’t meant to get which was a nice surprise and would’ve costed a lot more had we booked it originally. All staff were very helpful and always friendly. They were happy to accomodate with transfers and assistance with bookings. The villas are a bit out of the way from the hustle of Seminyak, which is a bit annoying when trying to book a taxi. We ended up hiring our own bike from a store only a few shops from the villas which was much cheaper and more convenient. There was a couple of issues staying there:
- bathroom smelt like mould and the bath was unusable as the taps smelt disgusting like off water or something. I was excited to utilise the bath but quickly discovered it was a no go.
- our villa yard wasn’t private as there was a big block of units next door looking in.
-on our last day we experienced an earthquake which shook our beds, no info was provided to us about the situation other than what we found on Google.
-rain nonstop first two days

Aside from that, good included:
-gianormous bed!
-daily room cleaning, always provided with fresh towels
-nice pool
-water filter in kitchen area which saved us buying water
-nice vibe/villa experience
All in all, it was a really good holiday. Great value for money and would stay here again. Main let down was the bathroom which needed maintainence.
Thanks for having us Bali Rich.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
59,2 Bedroom Villa With Private Pool,40,July 2018,"We stayed 5 nights at Bali Rich and absolutely loved it. My family loved being able to congregate in the outdoor kitchen/living room area and also having our own pool to use. The rooms were really large, especially the bathrooms. Yes, some guests would not be totally happy that some of the fixtures, cabinetry is a bit old, but we didn't mind at all.

The breakfasts were amazing and spread out for us each morning with a huge fruit platter. We also really appreciated the unlimited cold drinking water.

The only negative was the location. We found it more difficult than expected to cross the roads to get into 'downtown Seminyak'. There were also a few dogs around (not in Bali Rich, bit outside on the street) that we had to be careful of. Still, there was a grocery store and a small yoga studio close by so we were happy.

A great place to relax!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
60,Cozy despite located in the busiest area of Bali,40,November 2017,"Checked in at 4pm on our last day at Bali.
Extremely spacious Villa rooms. The attached pool though didn't look as appealing & hence avoided.. made up for some nice insta pics though.
The spa sadly wasn't functional, something that was a big letdown.
86$ for a private pool villa wasn't a bad deal in hindsight",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
61,Please avoid. Filthy dirty place - villa number 217,10,June 2018,"After 3 days in a beautiful villa in Ubud we were looking forward to our stay in our 'Bali Rich Luxury Villa'.
We arrived in the evening and we were warmly greeted with a drink in the lovely reception area and promptly taken to our one bedroom villa.
First impressions were favourable. The villa was large with a kitchen area.
We left our suitcases and had a meal then returned to retire for the night.
I used the loo and on the tiled wall it looked like someone had smeared some blood or faeces down the tiles.
The villa is very dark and poorly lit and it wasn't until we went to bed that we started to notice more unpleasant things...
The mosquito canopy had holes in it. There was smears of blood? all over it and insects rotting on it.
The pillows were filthy as was the duvet. The air conditioning worked but was extremely noisy and ineffective due to the large size of the room.
Next morning in the light of day things looked so much worse.
The bedding was stained. The towels were no better than rags. The veneer on the furnishings was extensively chipped, door handles were missing, tiles cracked, the ceilings and walls were stained, every surface was uncleaned. The list is endless.
I have attached photos to give you some idea.
Breakfast was good but I couldn't enjoy it because I wondered how clean the kitchen was.
I asked for two sheets for myself and husband so that we could wrap ourselves in these to protect us from the filthy duvet pillows and mosquitos due to the holes in the canopy and these were promptly delivered.
The sun loungers had no cushions and were extremely uncomfortable.
There was no hairdryer so I asked where it was as it was listed in the amenities and was told it was broken and there wasn't a replacement. After much wrangling one was delivered to my room. It was only good for the bin.
At this point I did express my feelings at the awful state of the villa.
The next day a man greeted us both by name. I felt he was part of the management team but was so disgusted I could not look at him in the eye.
An iron and ironing board is available upon request. We requested use of this and at the agreed time it was brought to our room. However, like the hairdryer, it should be binned. Please see the photos.
On our last morning, the smell around the villas was disgusting. Probably effluence.
On checking out, I was asked if we had enjoyed our stay by the very pleasant receptionist. I told her we hadn't and we would be leaving an unfavourable review and writing to the management. She was extremely apologetic.
While we were waiting a gentleman came to reception complaining about the smell and was showing the same receptionist photos from his phone.i can only guess what this was.
As we were leaving the man who had greeted us a couple of days earlier came to us and apologised profusely saying that the villas are old and seemed embarrassed. Rightly so. Old is acceptable, the level of squalor isn't.
Please, I have never left a review on tripadvisor before. I myself usually think that between the 5 star review and the 1 star review lies the truth. In this case 1 star is better than the truth.
I note that on other poor reviews, in the replies the management refers to all the awards. I am sure that once the villas were once award worthy. They are not now.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
62,Next trip to Bali I'll stay here again,40,April 2018,"I was very pleased with the quality to price ratio. The location is great and it's a ride away from the centre.

The pool and lounge chairs get sun almost all day and the outside its very spacious. The staff is very keen to help in any way possible. I also really like the outside restaurant and the possibility to have breakfast at your villa or the restaurant.

The bed is high and so comfortable! The area around the villa is so quiet you can get a great night rest. I also enjoy the indoors kitchen - not very common in Bali :)

The only downside I see is the pool. The water could've been clearer and there were a few small frogs around the grass (not a problem at all for us, they were so cute - but may be a problem to more picky guests).",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
63,Tired villas in need of some TLC,20,May 2018,"Recently stayed at the villas with our family and some other families. The Villas were a good size and the outside kitchen handy, however didn’t look like the pictures and there is NO communal pool.

The staff were kind and the daily breakfast was tasty, complimentary shuttle to Seminyak was great, room service good, however for the price we paid per night for the accomodation after having incurred the below seems excessive...

We stayed in a 2 bedroom Villa with our children (Villa 210) and noted the following:
Multiple broken tiles in the pool
Plate missing from the fountain
Cracked shower head pipe in bedroom that didn’t work correctly and leaked
No cushions for the sunlounges
Wardrobes poorly installed and didn’t shut properly
Door from bedroom to bathroom didn’t shut properly / door was too big for wardrobe frame
Towels stained and in need of a a good bleach
Multiple broken timber blinds in both bedrooms that let in lots of light
Pool fence we hired from the Villa had broken hinges on the gate and dangerous for our small children
Blood at the top of our mosquito net on the bed
Spa leaked
Water pressure went in and out in showers

Nice villas in need of some serious maintenance.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

67,Staff are Amazing,50,February 2018,"The staff at Bali Rich are fantastic, from the greeting at the front door to making your stay the best it can possibly be - it feels like you are part of the family! Welcome Back is the greeting every time you step into the driveway.

The villas are good but are getting a little tired - Management acknowledge this and are now starting to do renovations.

All in all this is a great place to stay and nothing is too much trouble.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
68,Very Welcoming & Great Hospitality,50,February 2018,"Stayed here for 3 days, the villa was great with private pool. Overall great time had a spa day and the hotel called in people for us. Also had a lot of room service food and staff were great. 5 Stars",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

70,SHOCKING!!!,10,January 2018,"We have stayed in Bali many times at many beautiful hotels, never have we seen a place so dirty and unkempt. Peeling mouldy walls, filthy bed linen and towels and a Manager who doesn't care. This place needs a major overhaul and to meet its responsibilities to unhappy guests. FIND ANOTHER VILLA!!!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
71,APPALLING!!!!,10,January 2018,"Filthy place! Mouldy walls, revolting stains on the bed linen, grey thin towels, an absolute health hazard. Don’t believe any of the replies the manager makes to complaints - he is missing in action and refuses to address the property’s problems. The staff are apologetic about how bad it is, but they are powerless! I have posted so many great reviews on TripAdvisor so I am not a serial whinger - THIS PLACE IS BAD",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
72,Bali rich villas,30,December 2017,For the price only thing was having own pool.Breakfast not included .No crispy clean white sheets as you would expect and not good value for money overall wouldn't go there again quite dirty we went back to our original hotel should never have left Sol House.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
73,Mixed feelings here,30,December 2017,"I have mixed feelings about this place as there were some good bits. The staff were all really lovely that we encountered and even though some were not so good at English they tried hard to understand us. We asked for a taxi to take us into the town one day as the place we wanted to go to was about an hours walk but they took us in a hotel car and did not charge us so that was great. The villas are really spacious and the best bit is the garden which is private and not overlooked at all. Spa treatments can be given at the villa or in the spa room and very cheap. Mosquito treatments are carried out each week which is good. The not so good bit though is that the furniture looks very tired and the photos on the website are far better than the real thing! The towels are appalling, they are so old and stained and I would only use them at home on my dog! The paintwork is slapped on the ceilings and has dripped down the walls. The bed was a good size but mattress hard. The plug got stick in the sink in the bathroom and took 24 hours before anyone sorted it out. There were no toilet rolls and I had to ask 3 times for more. We ran out of tea bags twice and not replaced. The air conditioning unit was leaking in the lounge and I had to put a towel on the floor to soak the water or risk slipping up. Pool has chipped tiles not cleaned. The porridge was fab but the other breakfasts we had were disappointing. The kitchen units are really old and tired and need replacing. Having said that the villa next door was being gutted and presumably renovated so hopefully there will be improvements soon. 30 minute walk to beach at least but we like walking so not a problem for us and taxi's are cheap. Seminyak itself is a bit disappointing but the village square nice and a trip to Ubud worth doing.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
74,Worst accommodation in Bali,10,November 2017,"I can't imagine that there are many places worse than this place. From the disgusting dirty room, to the leathery looking eggs for breakfast and service to match. To add insult to injury they actually charged more than US$160 per night!!! They need to close this place down and start all over again. DO NOT STAY HERE!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
75,"Very average, tired, dirty and full of mozzies!",20,November 2017,"We paid more money than we should have for what we got.
Staff are great and friendly. Villa were a good size... But that is all the good things I can say about the place.

The towels are filthy, all were stained, bed sheets stained, hair all over the place. Curtains were falling off the rails, Air Conditioner struggled to cool the room. Mozzie's all over the place, they even fogged for them but all that done was pushed them inside. We had to buy insect spray and used half a large can in 5 days.

Water pressure is weak, the toilet seat was not fastened properly, the bidet part of the toilet kept sticking. We had to often flush the toilet three or four times to flush the contents.

Pool pump stopped and had to be replaced, but the pool was filthy the entire stay. We swam as we were hot but had to shower straight after.

No information or compendium to tell us what the hotel offered, so we never asked for anything. We were down the very back on the right, we often found staff hiding in front of our villa (as it's away from cameras) smoking and chatting, and scrambling when we come down to our villa. The majority of our stay we think we were the only people there. Didn't eat at the restaurant because we read the reviews after we booked.

I could go on, but I will just say, we would not return here. It needs a major overhaul.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
76,Great Staff but dated villas,40,November 2017,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for the first 4 nights of our 14 day holiday. This by far was the most comfortable stay out of the 3 places we have now been to. Upon flying in late we were greeted at the airport by the villas driver, we requested to be taken to a local warung on the way to the villas which he was very happy to do and helped us pay as we were a bit rusty with the currency. Happy reception and workers greeted us, the first villa we were placed in had stained sheets, I called front desk and they were quick to swap us villas to villa 205. The villa’s themselves are quite dated with cracks in the walls and some of the skirting boards were rotting. As well as the bath was stained from age. Never the less, the staff were the stand out for us. Nothing was too much for them to assist with, they treat us like royalty and are so friendly. We were really sad to leave them! We will definitely be staying at Bali Rich for all future Bali trips and would recommend to family and friends",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
77,The dirty place,10,October 2017,V. Dirty place not clean at all have a lot of brokdown things and have a lot of bugs. Really bad place and so dirty.

79,A pleasant place to visit for break from City Hassle,50,January 2017,"It was a pleasant experience staying here for 2 days.

Well maintained private pool and very peaceful villa. Great for a break..

There are quite a good number of restaurants available surrounding this place to explore from American to Indian cuisines.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
80,We can't praise Bali Rich Villas highly enough,50,September 2017,"Our second wonderful holiday at Bali Rich, and we still can’t praise the place highly enough. There is nowhere else we will stay in Bali. If you are paying Aus$160 a night or less including breakfast, Bali Rich is the best value you will find – for many reasons.

First of all, the staff. Simply the best. Genuinely friendly, lovely people who will do anything to ensure your visit exceeds expectations. If anything goes wrong – for instance, the safe was left open in locked position when we moved in – it is fixed, in our experience, within minutes. Order a taxi and it is done immediately, and they appear to only use Bluebird, the most trustworthy company. And they go above and beyond the norm in helping their guests. Last year, when I suffered a minor but annoying medical issue and received a specialist referral by email at 4.00am, Shelley forwarded the referral to reception, reception printed it and stayed on the phone to Siloam Hospital until an appointment was confirmed, then provided a car and driver to take us to the hospital, wait for us, and bring us home – free of charge. What kind of a service is that? We have stayed in many, many hotels over the past 37 years, and the staff at Bali Rich are head and shoulders above the best we have ever known. They make a special place even more special.

Secondly, the villas themselves, the piece de resistance. They are not brand new, you may find a couple of minor maintenance issues, such as blown light globes – the electricity system in Bali is one of the most fragile in the world – but so what? Our blown light globes were replaced as soon as we asked for it. And despite the fragile power, in 20 days at Bali Rich we have not experienced a single power cut, or a single WiFi dropout. Everywhere else we have stayed in Bali and Lombok – that’s another seven or eight hotels or villas – we have had power cuts, sometimes for many hours, and in one relatively expensive hotel in Kuta we had power cuts every day, including four in a single afternoon. That’s a real pain when you are trying to watch a DVD, constantly having to go back to find where you were at when the power cut out! I repeat, not a single power cut, not a single WiFi dropout in Bali Rich. It’s important.
But returning to the villas – magnificent. A full 250sqm, which to my eye was 100sqm in the villa, and 150sqm in the garden and pool. The villa is enormous – to one side a massive bathroom, I estimate 7m by 4m, with toilet, one of the biggest baths I have ever seen, a two basin vanity with a big mirror, and a shower bigger than our bathroom at home, with direct access to the garden and pool area. To the other side a 7m by 4m kitchen / dining / lounge, high bamboo ceilings, the kitchen well equipped for basic cooking, two burner stove, heaps of cupboards, a big fridge/freezer, a water dispenser dispensing both hot and cold water, breakfast bar, a lounge suite and coffee table big enough for three or four people, and a wall of glass with sliding doors to the garden and pool. Then between the bathroom and kitchen, the bedroom, again with a full wall of glass and sliding doors to the garden and pool. About 7m by 7m (I know my measurements don’t equate to 100sqm, but they are just guesstimates, I didn’t take a tape measure on holiday), again with high bamboo ceilings, a desk and cupboard on one side, desk, drawers and lots of wardrobe space on the other, a safe in the wardrobes, huge King size bed which seemed bigger than our King size at home, flat screen television, DVD player. The flat screen television was not huge, perhaps 32”, so we moved it as close to the bed as the cords would allow because the room is just so big! The newness of the television, DVD player and fridge/freezer appears to depend on the villa, perhaps they progressively upgrade, because we stayed in two different villas this year – we cancelled our move to another area of Bali, and extended our stay at Bali Rich, changing villas in the process - and the equipment in the second was newer than the equipment in the first. However, it all worked perfectly well in both villas. And finally in regard to the interiors, separate airconditioners for each room, so effective that we occasionally had to turn them off.

Then we go outside. This is a real private pool villa, with the accent on both the private and the pool. The 150sqm garden (including the pool) is full of tropical greenery and a huge lawned area, immaculately maintained, and surrounded by a wall I estimated to be 2.3m high, so unless the Harlem Globetrotters book in your privacy is absolute. And they would still have to jump to look over the wall. In both villas in which we stayed, almost absolute silence, a real oasis away from the noisy Jalan Mertanadi 100m away. I can’t tell you how pleasant it was lying on the sun lounges shaded by an enormous umbrella, a couple of drinks on the table between us, watching the clouds drift by in a blue sky, listening to the bird calls, having a quick swim when we felt energetic enough – we spent hours lazing around doing sweet FA. And while we are not the sunbathing types, if you are you can sunbathe on the lawn, or drag the lounges out into the sun. Then there is the pool. It is a real pool – and again, don’t be fooled into somewhere advertising as a pool villa which only has a plunge pool, it’s just not the same. We made that mistake twice, a place in south Kuta which gave us a tiny courtyard too hot to sit in, and a 2m square plunge pool useful only for a quick cool-off – Aus$225 a night, and the whole thing would fit three times into the Bali Rich garden and pool area! No, Bali Rich offers a real pool, about 7m by 3m, beautiful to look at, perfectly maintained, long enough to swim laps, 1m deep at the shallow end, 1.5m at the deep end, with a waterfall feature in the middle. Nice.

Service to the villas was also top notch. We would only have the room made up and the garden and pool maintained every couple of days, and on days we didn’t need it the staff would always call to ask if we wanted it done – so if you want it done every day, it will be done every day. And what a performance – a small army descends on the villa, one or two doing the garden, one doing the pool, three or four in the villa with different jobs to do, and they do it very effectively. When they leave there are fresh towels throughout, bed made up, used bathroom items replaced, rubbish bins emptied, the pool is immaculately clean, and chlorinated if necessary, the water level is topped up if too much has evaporated, and there’s not a single frangipani blossom left on the lawn.

All of this makes a difference. This huge space makes a difference, and I can’t imagine you would find anything like it for the same money. If you do, let me know. But we’ll still stay at Bali Rich.

Thirdly, Bali Rich is a full service villa complex, about 20-30 private pool villas, with 24/7 reception, 24 hour security, a bar and restaurant open from 7.00am to 11.00pm, room service, breakfast delivered to the villa, staff on hand and available at all times. Don’t make the mistake of renting a villa which is simply a villa, without the full service facilities – we spoke to a couple in a bar in Seminyak who had done just that, and regretted it – driven from the airport, handed the keys and left to it, when something went wrong they couldn’t find anyone to help, and of course, they had to make their own breakfasts or find a local restaurant. Not so at Bali Rich. Talking of restaurants and breakfast – something like 18-20 breakfast choices at Bali Rich, call 116 to order, and it was more often than not delivered to our kitchen and set out on the breakfast bar by the always friendly room service staff in ten minutes. I generally went for the English, two eggs, bacon, chicken sausage, baked beans, mushrooms, grilled tomato, toast, Shelley said the omelettes were pretty good, the Dello Chef on French baguettes was excellent (although I ordered mine without the pineapple, horrible thought). I don’t think I would recommend the Eggs Benedict or Salmon Florentine, simply because the hollandaise on both split on the journey between the kitchen and the villa – but they were both perfectly edible, with plenty of salmon in the Florentine. All breakfasts are served with a choice of four fruit juices, a pot of freshly brewed coffee (enough for two cups each), a jug of milk, a plate of jams and preserves and honey, sachets of sugar, salt and pepper, and a plate of fresh fruit, generally four slices of each of three types of melon, with a slice of lime to squeeze over them – try it, really nice! The only problem was the toast – Balinese have no idea how to make toast, we’ve experienced this everywhere we’ve stayed in Bali, so make sure you order your toast very well done, or very brown – and if they still don’t get it right, there’s a toaster in your kitchen. As for the restaurant – not bad, but not great, the standard of food (in my limited experience) could be upgraded, but certainly more than adequate for a quick evening room service while you are packing for the morning flight home. And to be fair, we did not dine in the restaurant, it may be perfectly acceptable, the prices are not too bad, then menu is extensive, with something for every taste, but there are so many very good restaurants in Bali today that Bali Rich may have to work a little harder to match the competition. I feel bad now, I hate saying anything that’s not extremely positive about Bali Rich. But you just don’t often see people dining in the restaurant, and I’d like to see them improve the experience, and perhaps bring down the wine prices – you can buy a good bottle of wine at Rumours and Ultimo now for Aus$9.50, which is reason enough to go out to Eat Street - to ensure there’s less incentive to go out every night.

Okay, now to the location. I must say that when we first stayed last year we were concerned that Bali Rich was the ‘wrong’ side of Sunset Road. As it turned out that didn’t really make much of a difference – and what we got for the money made up for it many times over. But really, nothing that wrong with the location. There’s a great little warung, Warung Mak Oni, about 100m away, and several other restaurants, including the flash French L’Assiette, on the five minute walk to the right down to Sunset Road, and many more, including Naughty Nuri’s, if you turn left out of Bali Rich. On the Sunset Road corner, turn right (without having to cross Sunset Road) and there’s a good supermarket, and to the left is one of the most trustworthy money exchanges, Kuta Central. If you cross Sunset Road – we were brave enough to do it – you are immediately in the Seminyak shopping strip, and it’s only a ten minute walk from Bali Rich. However, we generally preferred to go just a little further to dine in Eat Street (Rumours, Ultimo), or have Indian at Gateway of India or Queen’s Tandoor, or to go to the best supermarket and liquor store in central Seminyak, Bintang supermarket, a great range of absolutely everything, including Robinsons spirits - gin, vodka, whiskey, tequila, everything, Aus$16 a bottle, so well worth a visit - and the exchange rate at BMC (also extremely trustworthy, and metres from Bintang supermarket) can be marginally better than Kuta Central, check it on the net before you go. So to get to central Seminyak from Bali Rich if you can’t be stuffed with a 20 minute walk in the heat, too easy – call reception, order a taxi (sometimes you have to wait five minutes for a taxi on Jalan Mertanadi, who can be bothered, and you are guaranteed a Bluebird through reception), it will cost you Aus$3 to anywhere in central Seminyak, and you are there in minutes. Aus$3 is the minimum fare if you book the taxi, but it also turns out to be the maximum to central Seminyak, so you never pay more. If you get a taxi on the street it may only register Aus$1.25-1.50 on the meter, but we always handed over Aus$3 anyway. And there are a few taxis, not Bluebirds, with dodgy meters or drivers who will refuse to turn the meter on and try to charge Aus$5 for an $Aus1.25 trip – just tell them to stop and get out. Returning to Bali Rich from central Seminyak, we never had to wait more than 30 seconds on the street, and generally we would walk straight out of the restaurant into a taxi. I timed it once – from getting up from our table, giving the waitress a hug, leaving the restaurant and getting into the taxi, one minute and six seconds. Love it!

Okay, I can’t finish this very long and very positive review of Bali Rich without talking about some of the negative reviews. None of them reflect our experience, some people just don’t seem capable of chilling out on holiday, and complain about the most minor issues. Don’t sweat the small stuff, I say. So let’s take a look at some of the negative comments.

‘Pool water had so much chlorine in it we only used it once!’ I’d rather have too much chlorine than too little – the staff maintain the pools immaculately, which includes making sure the water is safe, and Shelley’s eyes became slightly sore on one occasion, lasting a few minutes, when she swam 50 laps just after pool maintenance – one occasion in 14 days. So what?

‘Grey & musky smelling towels’. Nonsense – towels are always clean and smell fresh, changed every day if you can be bothered, I’ll happily admit some are past their prime, a little threadbare, the occasional small stain, never grey but perhaps a little tired, we had a good laugh when we got a nice fluffy one once, but so what, their purpose is to dry you, and they do that perfectly well – 250sqm, a real pool, heaps of space, and you give Bali Rich a bad review because the towels are not perfect? Give me a break.
You want a good as new towel every day, pay Aus$500 a night for five stars, and seriously, if you expect perfection for Aus$160 a night including a good breakfast, Bali Rich isn’t for you.

‘The staff are rude’. No, I won’t stand for that. This from a couple who both filed a separate poor review, which I thought was a miserable thing to do. If the staff were rude, it must have been because these two whining Poms were rude and demanding too – the staff are superb, and in two visits to Bali Rich we have never experienced anything other than the most helpful, friendly attitude from every member of staff with whom we have dealt.

‘The (toilet) flush is not doing its work, the shower water is not spraying, just dripping’. Ah, here’s a trap for young players. Press the flush on a Western toilet, and it flushes. But with a Bali toilet, you have to hold the button down until the flush has finished – simple, but not simple enough for some, apparently. As for the shower – I agree. Rain showers are an abomination, I can’t stand them, because they are what they say they are – rain showers. The water droppeth as the gentle rain from Heaven (Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice), gentle being the operative word. Absolutely useless things, I have no idea why so many hotels were sucked in to installing them. But what the correspondent conveniently failed to mention is that there is also a hand shower attached, with plenty of pressure – and that Bali Rich provides unlimited supplies of very hot water. From memory, there is also a tap in the shower. If you are going to tell a story, don’t be selective, tell the whole story. There is such a thing as lying by omission.

Having said all of that, there have been very few poor reviews this year, and it may well be that older poor reviews date from a year or two ago when the owner passed away, not difficult to imagine a management vacuum until his wife sorted out the hierarchy – just speculating, but none of the poor reviews, even those this year (the newest of which is almost six months old) reflect our experience. We love everything about Bali Rich, and we intend to stay there again and again and again.

Finally – delighted you have had the patience to read this far, I hope you have learned everything you need to know – but perhaps a disclaimer is in order. We have absolutely nothing to do with Bali Rich, we are simply very satisfied guests who have had the most wonderful time staying there on two separate occasions, and who look forward to staying there once or twice a year until we are too old to travel.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
81,very enjoyable stay at a reasonable price,40,August 2017,"Huge private villa with ample space; and large pool with plenty of area around it to catch the sun during the day. Bed was comfortable and a/c worked well. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Places to eat and mini-mart within walking distance, or easy taxi ride into heart of Seminyak for $3.
Minor maintenance repairs needed, such as the broken slats in the blinds. The bathroom is huge but lacks sufficient lighting, and the kitchen could use a microwave. Property is not very close to the beach.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
82,Good value - first time in Bali,40,September 2017,"My partner and I stayed at the Bali Rich Villas for 5 nights which was our first trip to Bali.
The one bedroom villa was impressive and you definitely have good value for money. Being from Australia and liking the finer things in life we came to Bali with little to no expectations and Bali Rich Villas left us impressed. The service is exceptional. They make a huge effort to speak English, and greet you each time you walk through the lobby. Very very helpful and always willing to make the stay more enjoyable for you.
We only ate breakfast in the restaurant once and it was satisfactory. The food and drink were good and well priced but far better can be found outside the villa.
It was a 5-10 minute walk to eat Street and really easy to have a taxi brought to the villas.
Would stay again!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
83,Perfect honeymoon,50,September 2017,"We just had w perfect stay for 3 nights of our honeymoon, the villa was lovely alongwith the food, the pool was very enjoyable, and the set up was up to our expectations, finally the most remarkable thing was the staff as they were very lovely and helpful.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
84,Alazing,50,August 2017,"We stayed here two weeks and throughout that time we had a hair dryer blow up on us, a float that needed to be blown up and hot water to be fixed. The staff all made sure all of these were done and fixed. They didn't charge us extra. The staff here made the place. Everyone of them made us feel welcome and did whatever we asked. The room here was very nice. The sheets and towels were a little dirty when we got given new ones but we didn't mind since they were still fresh. The pool here was very well looked after. The food was good and had variety. The location was also very good. A few minutes away walking distance there is the seminyak center where you can go to markets and find lots of restaurants. The beach is also very near there too. Would definitely stay again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
85,Good,40,August 2017,"The villa was really nice and the pool was a great feature to have. The villa needs a repaint and some updating but still clean and tidy. The staff are fantastic, all really friendly and have been good to us during our stay. Based on prices around bali for pool villas, its reasonably priced. Otherwise prepare to spend upwards of £2500 for 14 nights",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
86,It's Okay....! And the staff are lovely,30,July 2017,"I'm not sure about reviews of disdain for Bali Rich. No it's not the best villa on Bali but I found our relatively large villa (1 bed) spacious, clean and all in working order - not always the way here on Bali! The staff are very gracious and helpful. It is located well if you want to be near the main Seminyak strip and as we always hire a motorbike (scooter) it's well located to take advantage of everything Seminyak has to offer. Don't bother with breakfast. Don't expect it to be what the photos represent. But the plunge pool is clean and refreshing, the kitchenette has filtered hot and cold water fine for drinking, the bed is comfortable and for those who need it, the aircon and wifi works! We enjoyed our stay, and whilst we would choose other places if available it was good for the price.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
87,Too Dark for Me,30,June 2017,"I came to this vilma with quite a high expectation after seeing the review and some picture on the internet.Check in was not smooth as I booked this from a booking site on the internet for 2 villa and the reception said its only 1 booked.. But the reception is very helpful with that, and we got those 2 villa.. Like the title of this review we found our villa was very spacious but just too dark not just inside the room but also outside.. the light at each villa is not same light. Pool was okay n enjoyable, Breakfast is.. mmm I thing its kind a boring with its menu after stay for 2 night, later may be I prefer booked a non breakfast villa. location is quite strategic, located in front of the famous Gusto Gelato n not far from Pa Malen's suckling pig..",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
88,"The pool is the ONLY good thing - and we could't stand to be in it... Just, no.",20,July 2017,"Yes, the photos look lovely, and as you walk in and see the beautiful pool area and garden - it looks great. But inside is average and it only get's worse. You could tell the guy showing us around was prepared for people to be disappointed as his room tour included multiple requests to please ""not complain too much"".

They had decorated the room with romantic towel swans (using dirty towels) and drawn us a romantic bath with rose petals, unfortunately the bath was leaking so our ""romantic"" first night was filled with people coming an going trying to stop the leak. They couldn't.

The bathroom lights don't actually light the rooms so don't expect to get ready for a night out because you cant see a damn thing. Toilet door wouldn't close either.

Bed is ok. Sheets smell musty. Mould all over walls. Kitchen service are ok, though. Mosquito bed net would be much more effective without all the holes.

Ultimately though - this place is all about the pool. And it is a great looking area. The only issue is the villa staff use more chlorine than is no doubt necessary - so much so that despite it being the only really nice area in the villa - we ended up not using pool because it smelt so much we couldn't stand to be in it.

Not worth the price tag. There are MANY villas at this price that are maintained much better.

Absolutely would NOT recommend.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
89,Signs of old splendour,30,July 2017,Stayed in cottages...Which they call villa in Bali. Very spacious rooms. Each with a pool of its own. The food was very good. But they need make up or at least routine maintenance and thorough cleanliness. But location is good.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
90,Amazing honeymmon,50,November 2016,We stayed for 3 days during our honeymoon and this place was really above expectation. The flower decoration was amazing and private pool was clean and beautiful . Really enjoyed our luxurious stay . Thanks LH travels and Thomas cook to arrange our stay at bali rich villa,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
91,Nothing Rich or Luxurious to find here!,10,May 2017,"We stayed for two nights only...

Everything in this resort needs maintenance. Cracked tiles, dim lighting, dirty walls everywhere.

Staff was friendly but that was about the only good thing there.

Pool water had so much chlorine in it we only used it once! Bath with lots of black hair on the floor, dust everywhere, dirty mirrors, blocked sinks (which didn't get fixed!), dirty shower, grey & musky smelling towels...

All furniture (black gloss) had finger prints and scuff marks all over them, aircon was leaking water all over the place. Mosquito net was torn and stained, walls stained and scuffed, grey and musky smelling sheets with stains on them...

Kitchen area run down, no utensils or cutlery.

This resort needs a mayor overhaul - I'm sure it was nice when it was new.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
92,Extremely poor,10,April 2017,"Myself and my fiancé have been travelling for 7 months, and for the last 5 weeks have been with my sister and her friend and spent an amazing 2 weeks in Bali. The last two nights before they returned to the UK we thought we would treat ourselves to ""luxury"".

The rooms were dirty and needed work doing to them, the staff were rude, and we had to change rooms because there was a building site looking over our room. One of the worst places I've stayed in over the last few months. You can get much better value for your money elsewhere.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
93,Disappointing to say the least,10,April 2017,"We have been travelling for three months on a budget so thought we would treat ourselves to a 'luxury villa'. My first thought was that the whole resort needed maintenance work as it's a bit run down and dated. On our first night we were woken up at 4am to the air con leaking lots of water and making electrical sparks! We were then woken up at 7am to the sound of loud drills on a building site opposite our room. When we called reception they sounded annoyed that we had complained, did not apologise or sound surprised which makes me think it's a common occurrence. We had to move rooms because of this, without an apology from the manager and were refused a refund, no gestures were offered to compensate for a sleepless night. The staff are the rudest people I have come across in my whole life! The food is overpriced and disgusting... we ordered room service and no one came to collect the plates (even though we asked reception to do this). Overall don't bother staying here if you want a relaxing stay, and do not expect anything from the useless staff! Horrible.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
94,It's ok,30,April 2017,"The villas are old and not thoroughly clean but it is spacious. Staff are friendly but avoid getting an uber from the villa as that is frowned upon and they will not let the driver pick you up so had to walk out onto the busy street to meet him when he was turned away. Very poor service on their part. Also we thought it was highly coincidental that on the late night that we arrived and the morning we were to check out that suddenly there was no more TV reception and wifi stopped working. They explained maintenance on their part. Hmmm..On the whole though it was a relaxing vacation spent there and it is close to seminyak square, shops, bars and restaurants. About a 7min walk.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
95,Excellent ❤,50,August 2016,Loved this place! Amazing staff and food!! Clean and room service was excellent! Spacious villas with private pool. Beach was kind of far but quite close to seminyak square where all the restaurants are. Defo recommend! Oh and it's right opposite the best gelato icecream shop so extra bonus,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
96,Disappointing,20,March 2017,Stayed here on the second half of my trip the room was very spacious and nice area. Unfortunately the room wasn't clean dust around the lamps and on surfaces. There was cigarette ash in the pebbles around the bath tub and the mirror in the bathroom had marks all over it and lighting was good. Benches looked like they needed to be scrubbed. The toilet always smelt even when we alerted staff to it. The air-con in the bed room was leaking water even when we advised staff. Staff struggled with English and couldn't understand what we were asking most of the time and felt like we were an issue. Food wasn't the best had pizza one night waffles another and the same batter was used and it wasn't good in either. Our booking for the airport transfer wasnt booked in and we were told we would have to pay for a taxi to the airport which we stated we had it booked and they eventually covered the cost. I wouldnt stay here again.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
97,"Beautiful, Great experience at the Villas",50,December 2016,"It was a great experience at this place. The rooms are not just big but huge. Big kitchen to cook also. Big bathrooms and a nice private pool. The service was great. Superbb place to spend time. My advice to everyone travelling to Bali, do enjoy the experiences of Villas.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
98,Didn't live up the luxury name,30,March 2017,"Overall a disappointing experience had at Bali Rich Luxury Villa.
First impressions of our pool villa was it was very nice and definitely a 'luxury villa'. On further inspection it was unfortunately far from that!! General maintenance of the Villa (Broken floor tiles, dirt and dust, leaking air conditioner, broken toilet flusher).
Breakfast was served in the villa which was a nice touch but unfortunately the food including off the lunch/dinner menu wasn't amazing.
Shuttle bus provided was good taking guests to either Seminyak, Kuta or Legian. Unfortunately though we had alot of trouble with the staff not recording our seat on the shuttle bus and missing out on a seat and having to pay for a taxi. This also occurred when they didn't record our shuttle bus to the airport and they ended up putting us into a taxi.
Overall it wasn't the best place ever but had its good points. We though will not be staying here again when travelling to Seminyak.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
99,Very good,30,August 2016,"The villa we were given was massive!! Amazing big pool, with garden. Personally, I thought the villa was a bit run down and needed a bit of work. However, it was very good. The breakfast can be served in the villa too. Overall I can only say good about it.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
100,Bad toilet and staff,10,March 2017,"Just checked out from that place.
The room is big and spacious BUT not clean at all. Dusty and seemed not well-maintained.
And what makes me reaally upset is the toilet.
The flush is not doing it's work, the shower water is not spraying, just dripping. And the staff is doing nothing to respond to my complaint.

ONE OF THE WORST HOTEL/VILLA EVER",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
101,Little disappointed,30,March 2017,"Little disappointed with our stay, definitely not 4star would be 3 at the most villa is well set out but lacks cleanliness and maintenance has all the makings of a great 4 star villa but is let down. Bathroom was quite dirty with the pebbles around the bath full of hair, tags from clothes, even a potatoe chip! Sheets where a grey white and looked dirty. We watched house cleaning come ever day to clean the villa and they only cleaned the floor with water from the hose, no cleaning products. Side table was full of dust the whole time. Good things about this villa was very quiet and private, has shuttle 3 times a day to Kuta, Seminyak or where ever you want to go, pool was great in our villa lovely to sit around during the day. Breakfast was brought into our villa already cooked so the advertising of them cooking it i the villa for you is incorrect. All in all would I stay here again? No probably not I think there are better places to stay.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
102,Birthday trip for wife,40,March 2017,"To: Bali rich luxury,

I think sulistyowati, the manager did a great job, arrangement of the airport transfer and also the birthday cake surprise for my wife with the birthday song from the staffs. Perfect. The two drivers are excellent - ah gu and the other one, I forgot the name, a 25 young lad which is rather friendly. Half day tour - IDR 500,000, full day tour - IDR 800,000. The driver will drive you around to the places you preferred. The volcano kentamani is quite nice but kinda of time consuming to travel around 2 hours to there. Seafood by the beach is nice, watching the sunset and eating seafood is absolutely wonderful.

Maintenance of the villa can be further improved. Tv programs not really clear, bath tub water not hot enough. Quite disappointing, cos my wife cannot relax in the tub. The water is really really small, it take ages to bathe. Initially I was quite pissed as the spa at villa is under renovation and Groupon should state that in the contract, but not an issue, cos outside have plenty of spa and massage.. I don't have much problem with mosquitoes, probably in the day time, I have enclosed the rooms, with the air con on, to prevent the mosquitoes from entering the rooms. Breakfast delivered to the room, nice. I like the private pool, can suntan and swim whenever you like. Perfect place.

With that, nice place in Bali. Will visit again :) hopefully bath tub has hot water in future. Thanks!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
103,Villa that lacks maintenance,20,February 2017,"My girlfriend and I booked our vacation through a promotional website called Groupon. It's 5 min walk from Naughty Nuri's the famous pork ribs. Although the location of the villa was rather convenient, which was walkable within 15 min to various shops in Seminyak, I found the villa did not live to its name of ""Bali Rich Luxury Villa"". It was rather disappointing for us.

We felt that the villa could have been maintained better. During our 4 days stay, we had countered a dead cockroach (next to my bed side table) in the bed room, lizards, mosquitoes and ants. The water heater was also not working well, it kept on switching from hot to cold to hot. Certain fixtures within the villa was also falling apart. The lap pool was was poorly maintained too. Slippery floors due to the algae build up. Pool was small - 3 laps and you reach the end. Overall cleanliness of the villa I would rate below average.

Staff was polite and friendly but in terms of knowledge to recommend places of interest, they have limited knowledge.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
104,Less facilities,30,February 2017,"Not much facilities, breakfast menu limited, no buffet style, restaurant closes so early.... Call the reception they say need to check, ordered large to drink... Best part they say coffee machine broken... Food from the Villa was good... Need more improvement and better service! But nice concept... They put one picture in the deal but when we went there was not done as what we wanted, it was our honeymoon but no deck was done as shown in the deal.... Was a bit upset.... But had a good stay... 3*** for this Villa...",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
105,Great stay,40,August 2016,We stayed at Bali Rich for a week in August. The staff were very accommodating. Food was good. Service was very prompt. The private pool was frequently utilised and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. A little far from things but thoroughly enjoyable. We spent quite a few days simply staying at the villa and relaxing.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
106,Honeymoon ❣️❣️,50,May 2016,"Bali is an amazing place to spend quality time leaving aside rest , it will provide you the warm rich and luxurious feelings.
There are few places where you feel to visit again despite spending lot of money 💰. Bali is one of them , may it be adventurous sports , scuba life under water, cruise , beaches , night life cheaply priced shopping Bali gave us all. From hills to mountains to seas to beaches Bali is a complete destination to spend your days worth for spending.
Where Bali gave us the best of its warmth , the villa stay was on the same luxurious despite having displayed wrong information on the site that it is near seminayak beach facing its not yet it's worth to stay here you get a chance to move more and explore the most .
Property stay with pool kitchen and lawn made my memories still hold back my trip weather was superb to get tanned with my husband.
Many attractions increased our attraction towards each other too. There was something in that place that the memories still are so alive and lively.

I loved you Bali ❣️ Thanks to my husband for taking me to this amazing place",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
107,"We had a happy time here, with privacy and excellent service.",50,November 2016,"We stayed here before and after a five night sojourn on Nusa Penida so we were able to leave our luggage while we were away. We were welcomed back and given a special drink with towel on each occasion. We had the same room each time. Although our accommodation booking did not include afternoon tea we were offered it each afternoon. Banana fritters are such a delicious food- I never eat them normally, but with chocolate sauce they are delicious.
The villa was clean and spacious with a kitchen and lounge area. We had unlimited water to drink. The bed is comfortable and the pool is great.
We enjoyed the range and quantity of food at breakfast. We had something different every day. It's possible to order room service at no extra charge. Drinks prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent.
We found the shuttle to be useful and they were quite flexible so we were able to leave for Seminyak square earlier in the afternoon than was advertised.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
108,Awesome rooms but not happy with breakfast,30,January 2017,"After reading great reviews on Trip Advisor, I had high hopes to celebrate my honeymoon in Bali with private pool and all the great facilities but was a little disappointed. We had to wait 2 hours in hot and humid weather before getting the room but they had decorated the room perfectly for honeymooners. Flowers on bed and bathtub etc etc. Then we went to find a decent Indian restaurant for lunch for which the reception called for a taxi. I was impressed. Then me and my husband took a dip in our private pool which was clean and surrounded by plants. I was very happy until the next morning when we went for breakfast. There was no buffet unlike most hotels. We were allowed to order only one main course per person and one glass of juice or milk. Anything else was chargeable. In the evening, a lizard entered our room and we were surrounded by mosquitoes. Thankfully they had placed a mosquito repellent spray in our room already which was useful. Next morning we found lizards and insects in pool and room as well. We had also ordered a pizza which was tasteless.

So yeah... decent room, decent staff but the food and cleanliness can be improved.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
109,A lot for the money,30,January 2017,"Nice rooms, bathroom was huge but the big bath didn't work and smelt bad. The shower didn't really work either. Food was average, nothing special.

If they upped the food and fixed the broken bits it would be a 4/5. Location is a little off to get a 5/5.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
110,Excellent,50,December 2016,"Had stayed there for 3 nights. Amazing place,

1) walking distance to semniyak square and restaurants
2) shuttle service to kuta, legian and semniyak areas
3) freshly prepared breakfast served in your room

Staff was very helpful !!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
111,Ideal place to Relax and enjoy,40,October 2016,"One of the best accommodation that has everything near to perfect. Huge villas, great restaurant, Good Spa and amazing staff.

The Villas have everything that you need from a Ultra spacious bedroom, fully equipped kitchen and eating space and masterclass Bathroom.

More than anything Private pool is clean and big for a complete family.

Had couple of meals at the restaurant and food is really yum. To beat that the morning breakfast spread is lavish and you can eat-to-order

All in all a place that got every box ticked!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
112,Good hotel but can be better,30,December 2016,"Located quite out of way from the main part of seminyak. So can quite chill for those that want peace and quietness from their trip. Their staff is friendly. However, facility can be better. 2 out of 4 days, they were maintaining their water tank leading to no water to shower. Their pool is a little dirty from the plants around it. The rest of the room was pretty alright with no major complains.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
113,"Lovely Villa, Unbelievably Helpful Staff",50,November 2016,"We paid Aus$128 a night including breakfast for a one bedroom private pool villa, just $28 more than we paid for a moderate hotel room in Kuta, and that's amazing value. Set in a walled garden with a big pool - we estimated about 8m by 3.5m, much bigger than the plunge pools found in many villas - the airconditioned accommodation is spacious and modern. The bedroom is enormous, with a big King bed, flat screen television, DVD player and vaulted ceilings, to one side is a spacious kitchen/dining/lounge area, and to the other a massive bathroom with twin vanities, a huge separate shower room, and the biggest bath we have ever almost drowned in - with interesting plumbing, draining directly into a bed of pebbles below the bath! All three rooms have direct access to the garden and pool, with two sun lounges under a huge umbrella and a big grassed area allowing plenty of opportunities for lazing around with a drink or just sunbathing.

There is a wide choice of breakfasts, either eaten in the restaurant or delivered to the villa, and all we had were of a good quality. Similarly, room service or the restaurant were of good quality and a very reasonable price - although we were disappointed that the salmon tartare delivered to our villa was missing the promised fish eggs (presumably salmon roe) topping, which was the main reason we ordered it. But that minor oversight does not detract in any way from our high opinion of Bali Rich.

The staff were fantastic - call to have your room made up and a small army descends on you, cleaning up your mess, sweeping the garden of leaves, cleaning the pool, so many people that the whole job is accomplished in 15 minutes.

But where we really came to appreciate the staff was when I came down with five days of spontaneous nose bleeds, apparently not unusual for a man of my advanced (64) years, but very scary nonetheless. When they persisted after four days and one visit to the excellent BIMC hospital we emailed the hospital in a panic at midnight, and they responded by emailing a specialist referral at 5.00am - a brilliant service in itself. Shelley forwarded the email to Bali Rich reception, open 24 hours, and the receptionist printed the referral, stayed on the phone until Siloam hospital's normal business hours to make the earliest possible appointment - 1.00pm, the ENT specialist's first appointment for the day - then provided a car and driver free of charge to take us to the hospital, wait for us, and bring us back to the villas. Without her help we would have probably let our panic take its course and booked the earliest possible flight home.

While many would consider the location to be the wrong side of Sunset Road - we certainly did when we booked - the reality is that Bali Rich is actually in a very good location, close to many good and many cheap restaurants - for good go to the brilliant L'Assiette, for cheap the equally brilliant Warung Mak Oni. But there are many other choices. And if you want to dine at one of the hundreds of restaurants in Eat Street, such as Ultimo, Rumours and Char Char, they are only five minutes and a dollar taxi ride away.

For many reasons, we can not praise Bali Rich highly enough. We felt Aus$128 a night was extraordinary value, and if you have to pay more during high season don't be put off, Aus$150 would still be good value. We strongly recommend Bali Rich Villas, and we will definitely return next year - more than likely for much longer than this year's five days, we'll forego our five days prior in Kuta and five days post in Jimbaran, as there are enough very good restaurants easily accessible to keep us going for two weeks. Particularly L'Assiette, where I must return and spend some money to make up for a nose bleed on their fine white linen tablecloth just as our superb main courses arrived!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
114,Relaxing and recharging,50,November 2016,"Wow what a very beautiful villa to have spent 9 nights staying at! The staff are absolutely wonderful ~ friendly, kind and helpful. Great food in the restaurant and very clean amenities. Perfect for families, couples and groups of friends. Will certainly be returning on our next visit!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
115,One bed villa,30,November 2016,"The one bed private pool villa I chose because of the privacy and the fact there was some lovely outdoor space alongside the pool.
The bedroom was huge! And I slept well in the bed. The linen is clean and fresh and changed as often as you want it to. Water pressure in the shower was weak and a few times no water came out at all, but hey you are holiday, relax. Jump in the pool.
Power went out one night due to a thunderstorm and I informed them in the morning and the maintenance guy was there in a flash to fix it. Problem solved.
Great location, only a few minutes walk up to sunset road and across to the main shopping and eat streets of seminyak.
AC worked brilliantly the whole time I was there, never turned on the tv so can't comment on that, nor did I use the bath.
The kitchen needs some work though. Gaps to be sealed and benches and walls to be cleaned more thoroughly as moguls was starting to appear. Some cleaning cloths and detergent would have been handy seeing as it's a self contained (but small) kitchen.
Staff all lovely, no dramas there at all.
I didn't eat in the restaurant but did notice during my 11 day stay the same special up
On the board each night for dinner... hmmm glad I didn't eat there.
There are plenty of great restaurants close by anyway.
One word of warning around the streets of seminyak, ladies hold your bags and phones away from the street as motorbike passer-by's can easily reach out and grab your belongings!!
And they like to overcharge in stores like circle K or the mini mart so make sure you get your items scanned and check your money as it's confusing at first.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
116,Very disappointed,10,October 2016,"When myself and 3 friends arrived at the 2 bed villa we had booked, we were allowed to check in early which we were happy with.
After finding we had poor water pressure and absolutely no hot water, no towels and no air conditioning - I informed reception where I was told it would be sorted.
A call was given back to me where I was told their water tank was empty hence no water - WHAT???? And that we were to wait an hour to be able to shower. (We had already been in the villa around 5 hours at this point) after waiting and waiting, my friend went to get into her bed for a sleep, and was greeted with an open packet of an old face mask underneath her duvet, which was clearly from previous guests. Along with stained dirty sheets on all beds, body hair in the bathroom, hair on the floor and sides thick with dust.
I, again informed reception meanwhile still waiting for the water and the aircon to be fixed.
Housekeeping then came to the villa and spent an hour plus cleaning the entire villa under request because it was filthy, even outside kitchen area wasn't clean. This then left us sitting, waiting outside for them to finish.
After they had cleaned it, the villa was clean but we didn't receive any towels until 7.15pm that night.
Still no hot water, very mildly warm but I couldn't be bothered complaining anymore.

I was extremely disappointed with the service we received whilst complaining about the room, and was only given a discount on our final night due to me having to meet with the manager a day later.
Great location, and very comfortable villa but NOT worth the money you pay especially when the rooms are feral when you check in.

Will not be returning.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
117,Mouldy,20,October 2016,"We stayed 2 nights in a 2 br villa. Understand the standard may be slightly lower than western country but we had found one of the room smell of mould and was very damp.

We couldn't stay in that room and had to move.

Other than that, the doors didn't lock properly and we felt insecure leaving our things behind.

The only plus was that there was a nice local cafe nearby called latitude which we hung out.

Breakfast wasn't too bad.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
118,A Lovely 2 night stay,50,October 2016,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights from the 13th of October. We arrived a little earlier than expected, but were still greeted by tge lovely reception staff with a smile, a cold drink and chilled towel. Our 1 bedroom villa was beautiful and the pool and outdoor area were clean when we arrived. Everything you needed was there including pool towels, plates cutlery & glasses etc and universal power adapters on the power points which was great because we forgot ours! The filtered water dispenser gives 3 different temps and is handy to have given the heat. We ate in the hotel restaurant the first night and the food and cocktails were yum! A garlic bread, 2 mains and 4 drinks cost around $40 AUD which is great value! Breakfast had to much choice that my partner and I had trouble choosing! The fruit juice and toast were all fresh and the coffee and meals were hot when they arrived.Staff were awesome and couldn't do enough for you, especially arranging transport for us when needed. We had an awesome and relaxing 2 night stay and would definitely consider staying here again on a future trip to Bali!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
119,Excellent place for honeymooners,50,March 2016,"Kind staff and pleasant, calm atmosphere.. great place to spend some special moments with your partner.. cannot ask for a better place when you are on a honeymoon trip. Those quick room service, flower decorations, restaurant, welcome drink, etc.. still re-living the moments there..",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
120,Brilliant value for money,40,September 2016,"Stayed here in September 2016 with my partner. Breakfast is not buffet, there are so many menu choices and the very friendly and helpful staff allowed us to change the breakfast to suit. In room dining very very good and prices excellent. Even the mini bar priced well. The room is clean and large and the pool in location to get enough sun to be warm in the evening. The bathroom is massive. Water cooler with hot and cold, large fridge, and garden area large. It's not brand new and not pristine clean but we would stay here again due to the location, friendly staff and brilliant prices. Satellite tv could be clearer and tv could bigger. All in all this is a great villa in a good spot.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
121,GREAT VILLA!!,50,September 2016,My partner and I stayed here for 7 days and could not be anymore happier with the service and the staff! Everyone is so helpful and very attentive. Such a great experience and we would definitely come back. Thanks to all the staff!,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
122,"Amazing, amazing people!",40,September 2016,"We stayed here for 4 nights, the villa we stayed in was a one bed room. It's was beautiful, the bed was huge! Amazing people here, service was great and they make you feel very welcome! I went for a message at the spa here and it was so good, even better then the messages I get in Australia! I paid 100,000 rupiah for 30 minutes which is $10 AUS! I would recommend staying here.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
123,A lovely place to stay,50,July 2016,This was our last stop on our way home and we were very happy here. For the inexpensive cost of accommodation we did t expect to have such a well appointed and large villa. What won us over though was the great service and absolutely fantastic food. Breakfast choices were extensive and delicious. All the menu looked appetising and what we had was both reasonably priced and delicious. Staff were all lovely and they even paid for our taxi to the Airport on departure. Would definitely stay again.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
124,nice and private,50,August 2016,"Stayed in 1 bedroom villa for a 4 days. Villa is good, very spacious, big and comfortable bed, good aircon, very big bathroom. Pool is big enough. The benefit of villa was breakfast, you can choose you wanna eat in a restaurant or in the room....and its quite wide choice. Villas by itself we thought it was in great location, not far from shops, resturants...but in a nice and quite location. Staff is very friendly and helpfull, the executive manager very nice and king person. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would back def.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
125,Girls trip,40,September 2015,"We got a pretty good deal on these villas, good walking distance from Seminyak shops and eaterys, the villas themselves were beautiful in that contemporary Bali style, each villa had its own pool, you could opt for breakfast being delivered to you or eating up at their small restaurant...
Unfortunately we had a few problems there, money went missing from the safe in our room after the first night, and the second day our room got broken into,each time nothing was really done about it. It definitely dampened our trip, and made me feel uneasy about leaving things there.
Apart from that we got a free half hour massage each day, that was included in our booking, the girls were great and very friendly...
I really liked these villas, and would like to say I would go back, but the thieving part of our trip did leave a sour feeling....
So maybe next time id choose somewhere else in Bali further from the touristy areas...",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
126,"Lots of mozzies, dirty...",20,August 2016,"The first glance of this villa was great, the pool looked great the room was nice and large bathroom that was modern, after looking around the pool had green moss or mould near the fountain and on the tiles where the fountain was, we weren't sure if the pool had been cleaned after seeing this. When looking at our bed it didn't look clean... There were hairs on the bed and stains... We went up to reception and complained and the pool was cleaned straight away and the bed linen changed. Overall we had an ok stay, staff were great on breakfast - not sure if they understood much English. The kitchenette area was small and outdated but we didn't use it. They provided mozzie coils and spray which was great, the whole set up was good with a door from the shower to the pool.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
127,Great stay,40,July 2016,"The 2 bedroom villa was great
Very friendly/ helpful service
The villa is private and spacious and all round very nice with nice complimentary breakfast
The only minor downfall is the little maintenance problems , like doors and blinds need a little attention to work properly
Other than that our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay there",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
128,Beautiful Villas,50,June 2016,"Can't get over how lovely the staff are! Everyone is so friendly, including our drivers! I loved this villa, so private & beautiful! We booked for 6 nights but changed our minds, twice, on dates and they were so lenient towards us. We only stayed two nights (1st & last night) out the six because we wanted to explore other places. Included in the package was breakfast (which they bring in & set up for you) & airport transfers. They also helped book our tours :) The only down side is that this place is in the middle of ""nothing"". If your expecting resort/beach/beautiful scenery then this is not the place for you. However if you want to spend time alone in a villa & not really do anything but just relax then I guess this would be perfect. You have everything you need (Private pool, kitchen, shower, bath tubs - everything looks amazing by the way. Our last night they upgraded our room to the double villas. We got the outdoor kitchen area. AMAZING!!!!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
129,Privacy & Good Service,50,July 2016,"Bali Rich Villa is nestled in the heart of Seminyak area. It has a pleasantly beautiful pathway with a rainforest background (similar to W Hotel, Seminyak) that leads to the hotel premises. When you reach the main lobby, you are immediately greeted with beautiful smiles and warmth from the staff as you sip along their cool and refreshing welcome drink in the scorching hot weather.

The facilities and privacy within the villa itself to is great. We didn't even need to go out on the first day we reached. Food, massage and any other required amenities were delivered to our doorstep. When we eventually decided to explore the surrounding area, to our surprise, we found that the villa was near a supermarket (with Pizza Hut, BreadTalk, Burger King,JCo), a short walk to Seminyak and is actually not as far away from Seminyak as we initially thought.

What we liked the most is really the service that the staff provided. They were very patient and thoughtful. Whenever we asked them for their services - as mundane as why the lights are not on, or for mosquito coils, or for large towels, they almost immediately came by to provide what we require with a friendly face.

With the reasonable price, good location, and luxury of a private villa, I would definitely put Bali Rich Villa as one of my top choices if I visit Seminyak again.

The only negative is there are a lot of mosquitoes, it is so irritating. Not too sure if it is because all villas face the same problem or my blood is too sweet and mosquitoes are attracted to it. I had like over twenty mosquito bites, I am not exaggerating. When we reached, the villa had a mosquito extermination exercises by ""smoking"" the place already.

Perhaps one small improvement is to provide more mosquito coils or one ""Zambak"" for each guest villa room or mosquito repellents or have them on sale so that if we get bites we can immediately buy it from the counter. But I guess the mosquito issue is not something anyone can control, perhaps we should have just brought our own mosquito repellent.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
130,Great place,50,May 2016,"Villa is great! Great pool! Good service! Nice breakfast, good cleaning service! Good reception service! Nice airco! Only the entrance and restaurant looks little pour. Location is also great! Just a 10 min walk to the main shopping street.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
131,Peaceful & Private,40,April 2016,"Just returned from a fantastic 10 night stay . Villas are nice enough , in need of a makeover , but not ""falling apart"" or anything. Just depends how picky you are about wear and tear . The only downfall is with such high ceilings and older aircon units , it does get warm inside if u don't keep it closed or go to bed too early ( before it has time to cool the roof with the night air ). The 2 bedrooms only have one air con unit in the room , where as the 1 bedrooms have one in the bedroom , lounge room and bathroom . Pools are amazing and staff are very friendly . If you are just a couple , I would suggest not getting upgraded to the 2 bedroom Villas. The one bedroom ones are much nicer .",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
132,Peaceful Seminyak Retreat,40,April 2016,"We stayed for 5 nights and had a fantastic relaxing visit. The staff were friendly and helpful, always smiling! We had an issue with the first villa we had and the staff moved us to another villa immediately. The private pool was fantastic and the gardening staff do an amazing job keeping the grounds looking immaculate. Breakfast was also very good with plenty of options available. They will also arrange airport pick up/drop off if you want.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
133,Honeymoon visit,40,August 2015,We stayed for 10 nights in August/September 2015 for the end part of our honeymoon. We've been to Bali multiple times and throughly enjoyed staying here. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the daily free shuttle bus to kuta and surrounding areas was great. The rooms need a slight upgrade but when we were staying there was a lot of construction going on so hopefully this was what they were working on. Pool was a great size in the 1 bedroom villa we stayed in and there was plenty of space inside and outside of the villa. Breakfast was delicious every day. Looking forward to coming back again.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
134,Still One Of The Best In Seminyak,40,April 2016,"This is our 6th visit to Bali Rich Seminyak where we generally stay for 8 days each time. Our pool was large and very clean, as were the grounds and our one bedroom villa.

They have a new chef and the food was fantastic - big change since last time.

We had 3 treatments in the Day Spa - these were only average. You can get way better quality treatments close by though at other resorts.

We did inspect other villas in Seminyak for our next trip over but decided we'd come back to Bali Rich. The main decider was the big pool and outdoor area, value for money plus the staff are very friendly and attentive.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
135,BEST PLACE TO STAY IN BALI,50,April 2016,"WE LOVED EVERYTHING!
The below reviews I can't comment on but our villa was stunning, clean, fresh and in perfect working order!

The staff could not be more helpful, so friendly and went above and beyond with us!
Some examples: my finace lost his phone in a taxi, Tia and the reception staff tracked down the driver from their onsite cameras, contacted him and got his phone back for us!

My fiancé planned a very detailled proposal during our stay and in the months before our arrival - all with the help of the staff and Mr Buhdi!

With the assistance of Mr Budhi again- I organised some decorations and a cake to be brought to our villa while we were out for my fiance's birthday! Mr Budhi also personally called the villa to wish Mark a happy birthday as did all of the staff when we were heading out that evening!

We also hired their driver for the day and he was brilliant - took us to great places, gave great information and tips and also a few places of our own we asked to visit!!

I cannot thank them enough - they made our holiday!

Great location, taxi's are no problem and everything in Seminyak is walking distance!

The facilities are beautiful and very well maintained by the staff, our villa was perfect and was cleaned everyday, including fresh sheets!

On our last day we were offered a complimentary late check out as our flight was at 1am, we got to stay in our villa until 7pm!

Great cocktail and menu list and all very good prices!

Would recommend to everyone and will definitely be back!!

Thank you Bali Rich!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
136,Break away without kids,40,April 2016,"We have just returned after staying 5 nights at the villa, it was lovely and so relaxing, staff could not do enough for us, breakfast was good, and the barman who I think was called Matu always had a smile to greet us. The villa was old but clean, and maybe the aircon could be updated. Overall we had a wonderful trip and will definitely be coming back to Bali Rich Villas.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
137,Do not stay here- old and run down!!,10,March 2016,"I stayed in the Bali rich ""luxury"" villas with my husband and 2 children and by no means was this a luxury villa. Upon arriving at 2 am with two little kids my husband and my self were given a welcome drink but my children were ignored and went thirsty. The room we stayed in was absolutely disgusting, it was filthy dirty and looked like it had not been cleaned before we arrived. The shower had mould all over the walls and the whole shower was hanging out of the wall. I did not even want to shower my children in there as it was disgusting but the bath tub was even dirtier and had not been cleaned properly. The bed sheets and bath towels were meant to be white but were all stained and grey looking. The cot my daughter slept in was a disgrace, it was so old and rickety and luckily I bought her sheets for the cot as they only made the cot with a bottom sheet and nothing to go over her. The blinds in the rooms were all broken and the rod that u open the shutters with were all broken and snapped off. The out side dining chairs were all filthy and stained and the tiled floor outside was so dangerous when getting out of the pool as it became very slippery with my son falling over many times and nearly breaking his ankle. I have absolutely nothing nice to say about this place and after many times of speaking to the manager we gave up because the manager told us that a lot of people complain so obviously they just ignore it but r happy to take people's money!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
138,Far from the luxury advertised,10,March 2016,"I am currently staying at the Bali Rich so called luxury villas after a wonderful barrier reef cruise. I thought it would be the perfect end to my trip of a lifetime. Not so, After a terrifying and chaotic trip from the cruise terminal I arrived at these villas. My taxi driver didn't even know where the villas were he had to ask someone. This was already proving to be worrying. We eventually came to this run down part and first impressions weren't too bad. However after being shown to the villa it started to go downhill. These villas are old and tired and nothing like the advertisement on the web site. I had booked this with a travel agent specialising in luxury travel. I have taken numerous photos to send to them advising them of the situation. I have yet to speak to management. The whole of the villa is unsatisfactory.
The showers don't work properly
Thes toilet is dirty and running all the time
The shutters on the windows are all broken
The kitchen area outside the villa is old dirty and the units are broken
The towels are old and grey
The seating round the private pool area is old and dirty
The buffet breakfast we were told we were having turns out to be a choice of 1 from the menu and you can't mix and match for whatever stupid reason that is I don't know.
On the road up to the villas there is a run down area.and as for the main road outside you take you life in your hands when you walk down there.
The beach is at least 15 mins drive by taxi away from the complex and the restaurants about appear dingyand dirty
I am waiting for a response from the travel agent but I am only here for a couple of more days and after a long journey from Sydney don't feel like another move.i will therefore be looking at some kind of compensation.
This is my first and last visit to Bali it is a place I would never visit again or recommend to anyone. Can't wait to go home even if it is cold there!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
139,Peaceful villas,50,February 2016,We had an amazing time here the staff were excellent very friendly and helpful. If you're looking for peace and quiet and your own privacy than this is differently the place. The food is amazing at the restaurant. Great location to shops and main road that leads to kuta,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
140,"Beautiful place, brilliant hospitality",50,February 2016,"We visited Bali and selected Bali Rich in recommendation from a cousin.
And yes, it is a perfect place for honeymooners.! The welcome, privacy of the villa, the hospitality, the breakfast options for vegetarians, proximity to alot of happening places & yes the value for money that Bali Rich offers is excellent.

Budhi is the guy who helped us in every possible way and made sure he gets a perfect review from us. We loved the villa so much so that we were planning to stay at Rimba Jimbaran for 2nights which supposedly is one of the best properties in Bali but we moved back to Bali Rich after spending one night at Rimba.

If you are a couple who is looking to chill after a long tiring wedding event, would love to go for walks, prefer vegetarian breakfast and love the pool, I guess Bali Rich is definitely a go to place for you all. Please do get in touch if you need any assistance or additional info. Cheers.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
141,Highly recommended - Peaceful and Personal,50,February 2016,"Awesome vila with excellent room space with huge garden and private pool. Private kitchen with stoves, refrigerator, utensils and drinking water facility. Bathroom is also very spacious and clean with separate area for shower and bath tub. Excellent staff and service with delicious food. Vegetarians like me can find good breakfast with potato sandwiches, corn flakes and fruits with juice and milk/tea/coffee. The place is quite clean with almost null insects and mosquitoes. I would highly recommend this vila for those who are looking out for a personal spacious vila with private pool and bath tub and large bedroom with private kitchen.

142,Very Spacious villa a bit dated but nice enough,40,January 2016,"We stayed at Bali Rich for 3 night's, they are a big spacious villa with nice bathroom, and the private pool did the job. The split systems do struggle ide say due to the high pitched straw roof, and it id get hot in the bathroom as it did not have a system.
The lady's at the spa are lovely and if you go in the afternoon they have cheaper rate that luckily tied in with happy hour at the bar. We thought the prices where great until we seen the size of the drinks, small is an understatement but still tasted delicious.
We didn't need to use the bus service as we hired a scooter a little down the road. The breakfast was a disappointment but when your a bit hungover its good enough and you can order it to your villa not that we worked out how to do that.
All up it was nice enough only major annoyance about the place was the amount the big wooden 4 post bed squeaked",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
143,"Old,tired and shabby with terrible food",20,December 2015,"It is hard to comprehend where the other reviews about the Bali Rich Villas are coming from...
The staff are indeed friendly and they do their best. However, the standards of the villas( and we were in three)are terrible.
The doors are un-lockable and the electrics are extremely dangerous with bare wires showing.The AC can't handle the heat and the quality of finish is a disgrace.
Towels and bed linen were stained and the food is just TERRIBLE.
This is NOT an opinion as we have video and photographic evidence.
For the money that you pay you will be easily able to find considerably better quality accommodation in Seminyak.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
144,Comfort and peaceful,40,January 2016,"Staying here we felt like first class guests. Nothing was too much trouble and their hospitality and customer service was superb. Excellent and prompt room service, and lovely day spa. Pool and outdoor lounge was a peaceful space to spend the day. Free shuttle into Seminyak square, Kuta or airport 3 times a day.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
145,Quiet Luxury Villa,40,August 2015,"Love my room to the max! You will get the WOW factor once you step into the room and the toilet!!! Villa size is really big and in fact, it can really accommodate for 4 people.

Pool location and size is good - i hate pool that are near a big piece of plantation where you do not know there might be a snake coming out from nowhere etc however for luxury pool, you can see all corners of the pool thus making it safe for children etc to swim",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
146,A Dream Come True,40,December 2015,This was my first time staying at the Bali Rich Villas. I fell in love with beautiful resort and I would not fault anything about our stay. The villa that we had was the best value for money that I have had with a villa in Bali. I really never wanted to leave and wished that I could stay there forever. I was a bit concerned before I first stayed here. As I thought that it was going to be a bit away from the main part of Seminyak. But everything was close by and the main Eat Street of Seminyak was only a 15min beautiful walk away. The staff at the Bali Rich Villas were just so wonderful and helpful with everything. We were given a 2 bedroom villa when we checked in. But I had booked a 1 bedroom villa. They sorted out the villa I booked and within 30min. We were moved to our villa. I will be staying back here again next time I stay in Seminyak. I really did love this place.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
147,Dated villa needs refurbishment,30,December 2015,"Villa size is great and generous in size but fittings need to be refurbish urgently. If you are having young kids running around the villa , I would personally find it very dangerous.
Point 1 : Wood planks flooring at pool area is popping out with nails sticking out,
Point 2 : Private pool is filled with leaves & fallen flowers & inserts.
Point 3 : Aircon system is not working properly despite after attendance by technicians.
Point 4 : Mosquitos is everywhere on our very first day upon check-in.
Point 5 : Food wise , you will definitely find better food offered outside the villa!
Overall, I would say that the villa needs appropriate Maintenance! The only thing that the villa have is helpful staffs ,always there to help attend to your queries .",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
148,Peaceful luxury,50,December 2015,"We were picked up by the hotel car at midnight and brought to the hotel. We were very impressed with the setup of the single story bungalows and upon entering ours were enchanted...our own pool and the amenities in the bungalow were clean and spacious. The bathroom spa is huge. Very little noise, so we could relax and go for a massage or pampering within the complex at very reasonable prices. The staff is very helpful but non intrusive. Free bus taxi 3 times a day to various places in Bali...Breakfast is included and caters for all tastes..most definely the best place we have stayed in for hassle free holiday",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
149,Excellent Service ! Amazing Place,50,November 2015,"I stayed in Bali Rich for 5 days and 4 nights. Couldnt ask for a better place ! The private villa was very well maintained . The receptionist to the bell boys were so friendly and their focus on service is much to be applauded for. Their room service is one of the best i have had. They have a wide variety of breakfast menu and they even have good Tapas and happy hours are open from 2 PM !
We even took their day tour. The driver was so helpful and we had great service from him. He even help me to arrange a unforgettable sunset dinner .I was able to give my wife a great date night because of that.
All in all, Bali Rich Luxury Villa is the place to stay if you plan to be in Seminyak ! They know how to take care of people ! As you can see , I am so happy with their service. Kudos to the Bali RIch Management !",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
150,Excellent for private romantic momnets but needs a little makeover,40,March 2015,Hotel offers of private romantic moment with an excellent pool villas. Location of the Hotel is also very good but breakfast is just average. They don't offer buffet and have limited options. Toilet needs a real makeover as many things were not functioning properly like Jacuzzi. Staff are very polite and helping and displayed great hospitality. You can try massage which is really good.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
151,THE MOST AMAZING PLACE TO STAY IN SEMINYAK,50,October 2015,"My room was fanatstic a beautiful spacious one bedroom villa.The garden is amazing full of vibrant colour.Its just a shame that the staff are underpaid for there work that they perform.They go above and beyond for the guests which goes unnoticed by higher management.To my surprise as a regular guest i found out that 3 of my favourite staff members had left due to salary problems.Good staff are hard to find which makes the guest stay that much easier and pleasurable.staff here are fantasic sumadibudi,gung gek,edi,wayan,agung,dedek,komang,agus,yanti,wei wei,sri,bon bon,dewa,hendra,chero,ngaruah,wian,the gardening staff,room staff,spa girls,security and the guys in the office.They all do a fantastic job.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
152,"Home made hash browns at breakfast! Yum! Shame my hubby ate mine, too!",50,October 2015,"Our stay was a four night package with pick up and deposit at the airport. We transferred from a nearby hotel so just paid the $2 to transfer by taxi.
Our villa was enormous. It included a complete kitchen.(Had we wished we could have had Chef cook our meals at the villa or take us to markets and cook us a meal but we were completely happy with the food options available to us.
Our bathroom included a two person spa, which we enjoyed immensely, every day.
One of the things I liked about Bali Rich was that they provided a choice of Balinese or Nescafe coffee. We use beans at home so it was a touch we enjoyed. Breakfast included omelette, toast, hash browns, juice, fruit and coffee. It was a large breakfast, fresh and tasty.
Afternoon tea was a real treat! Pisang goreng- I am a convert to this dish. The banana was so yummy and gooey. The batter was light and crunchy. It was so divine with chocolate sauce. One afternoon we were given coconut in green pancakes with chocolate sauce. Texture and taste was delicious. (Green pancakes seem a little unusual to me but we decided it's about using all the senses, and colour is part of that.)
We enjoyed two dinners here. My barramundi with capers was strongly flavoured by the capers, which disappointed me but the other foods we ate at dinner, including wedges, cheese garlic bread, snapper and delicious vegetables with rice, were excellent.
We used the shuttle to take us to Seminyak and we walked back to the villas. Traffic and road works aside there is no great issue with this unless you have a pram. Our walk took us past some interesting shops including a lighting shop which we found fascinating. In the evening there is less dust to deal with.
The welcome here is personal and sincere. Suman and his staff aim to please at all times. I was impressed by the high standard of English that was spoken and understood. We were questioned regarding any issues of maintenance which we had noticed, which is unusual. Our pool was large and we enjoyed using it. Heliconia, palms and bougainvillea decorate the grounds.
We asked Bali Rich to organise our transfer to Nusa Lembongan. The price we paid to the cruise company was the same price as we would have paid online and we paid the day of transfer rather than the day of booking. It just showed us how honest the company is. Thank you very much. We would love to return.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
153,The most amazing place ever!,50,November 2015,"We have just left and want to say we had the most wonderful relaxing friendly holiday ever!
Thanks to all the staff at bali rich, from the office, bar, kitchen, drivers, maintenance and the operations manager.
You are one big happy family and made us feel like your family too.
You made our stay a complete delight.
The villa was so lovely and clean and spacious.
The private pool was to die for. We spent more time in and around the pool than inside.
The food and service was amazing.
Our driver Agung suryawan was so knowledgable and friendly.
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at bali rich.
Side note - a big hug to martin - a very very regular guest of bali rich but part of the family.

We will be telling all everyone that they need to stay at bali rich when they go you bali.

We miss you guys already xx thankyou.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
154,Comfortable Stay,40,October 2015,"Had a really comfortable 5D stay in One bedroom villa. Villa is so spacious with nice garden & pool. Great housekeeping, fast & efficient, pool cleaned everyday. Tasty food served at the restaurant. Just a couple of minutes walk to a convenience store. Taxi to Seminyak Sq is around IDR50k.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
155,Private pool villa,50,October 2015,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Bali rich luxury villas in room 215. On arrival we received a warm welcoming from staff and were showed to our room which was very spacious and clean. Our room was cleaned daily and to a very high standard. The villa was very private and perfect for couples. And we had or own private pool, and living room area.

We had breakfast in the villa each morning and were able to choose from a variety of breakfast dishes ( full English, continental, eggs any style etc). Couldn't fault the breakfast as well as lunch and dinner. ""happy hour"" on various cocktails and drinks. Location is great and around a 10 min walk to the beach and shops.

Over all couldn't fault this place. Thank you to all staff at Bali Rich Villas for the wonderful hospitality.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
156,"Spacious Haven close to Seminyak, but not in the middle",40,October 2015,"Stayed in a one bedroom villa with pool for 10nights. Spacious, in fact large villas which are not new but comfortable with lounge area, big bedroom and big bathroom. Pool is a nice size and clean. Rooms are cleaned every day to a good standard. Breakfasts are good and choice is large and delivered to your villa if you wish. Staff are fantastic as are most Balinese and willing to help in any way. Free shuttle to Kuta, Legian or Seminyak each morning at 11 starts the day off well.
This is really nice place in Mertinadi street where there are other places to eat including Ingka, a good Warung and Gusto Gelati.
Would stay here again, but prefer the rice fields in Umalas to the city.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
157,Nice villa,40,October 2015,"Air con spoiled when we reach villa room 200. Let us wait for two hour to repair.But still cannot function. At the end we request to change room. They immediately help us change the room. Room & bathroom very big. Staffs are helpful & polite. Good wifi. Quiet place. Nice foods there.
Maintenance is very important. So, hope that keep check all the air con there because cant sleep without it. Weather is very hot.
Worth it to stay here! Keep it up !",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
158,"Great value for money, amazing staff and room",50,September 2015,"Stayed here for 6 nights and loved everything. The room service was great quality and well priced, the spa was amazing and super cheap. The room was beautiful and the pool was even better than expected and super private and quiet. The staff were very helpful and friendly, breakfast was served in our villa daily at the time we wanted. They have a driver on site who will take you places nearby for free if they are available. The beach is a $3 AUD cab ride and the main shopping/restaurant street is a 4 minute walk away.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
159,Darren & Bec,50,September 2015,"As soon as we arrived we were greeted at the airport by our driver Ketut. He had to wait over an hour as our plane was delayed but still had a big welcoming smile on his face. Once we arrived at Bali Rich we knew we had luxury at our feet. Budi was the hotel supervisor who checked us in and explained what we had included in our package and after minimal paperwork, a welcome drink and refreshing cool towel we were taken to our villa. OMG it was amazing. Exactly like the photos on the Internet. We were so happy. All the staff from room service, the day spa, restaurant, reception and the cleaners were so nice and always smiling. We will definitely be coming back to Bali Rich and will be highly recommending it to all our friends and family. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Miss you all already. A holiday we will never forget. xxxx",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
160,Fantastic,50,September 2015,"Staying in villa 205 and this place is wonderful. The rooms are huge and the resort is so peaceful. Breakfast can be served in the villa or in the restaurant - there is plenty of choice and the staff are so friendly. The villa is located near plenty of shops and restaurants in Seminyak easily accessible from the back entrance of the resort
Highly recommend this place 😄",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
161,"Beautiful villas, wonderful staff",50,September 2015,"My husband, 9 month old son and I stayed at Bali Rich Villas for 5 days. Firstly the villa's themselves are fantastic. Huge rooms, large pool and grounds. They were always kept very clean and tidy. The staff there were always helpful and we're especially great with our son. The ladies in the restaurant were wonderful! Great location and lovely food in the restaurant. We are already planning our next trip there",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
162,Better than expected.,50,September 2015,"The villas are amazing, private pool bigger than I expected. We have outdoor kitchen and garden. Sensational. Will be back. Great service, staff couldn't do enough for us. Husband and I were blown away with the whole package.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
163,Pretty decent place to stay,40,September 2015,"The location is rather good. The staffs are friendly and responded to our requests readily and promptly. The environment is pretty quiet and peaceful. Great for a relaxing vacation!! Good decent place.

I like their breakfast!👍

The cleanliness still has room for improvement. Their wifi signal can be stronger and better as well.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
164,Sheets not changed and bugs galore,10,September 2015,"We are staying at Bali Rich now and will be checking out tomorrow after just one night. We booked a 2 bedroom villa on a scoupon deal. None of the beds have clean linen, the pillows stink and when we pulled back the sheets they had bugs underneath. We've had to call reception twice due to issues with the safe and in the second time were left waiting an extremely long time, which was surprising as villas are very quiet. We would rather forgoe the money we have paid and look for alternative accomodation. Very disappointing",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
165,Nice place,40,August 2015,"Nice place, quiet, friendly staffs. One bedroom with private pool. Ideal place for newly weds. Food is nice too. Nothing much to complain about.

Things for improvement,
Wifi - relog everytime devices go to sleep
Food - not hot enough, maybe is the distance from the kitchen to my villa.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
166,Very comfy and cheap for a private villa,40,September 2014,The villa really nice with private pool and big space room and big bathroom too.and the most great about this villa it has a very big jacuzy inside the bathroom.the bed also big and comfy..the living room and kitchen are outdoor near the pool.if you look for peace and relax at the villa..this villa is really reccomend..and also very cheap for this kind of villa around this area with this kind of facilitates.only the furniture a bit rusty so need improvement.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
167,Beautiful,50,August 2015,"We loved our stay. We booked a 1 Bedroom Deluxe Villa. Our room number was 219, it was about a 2 minute walk from the lobby and seemed like the furthest away from the lobby. It was very peaceful and quiet and we didn't really hear any other guests. We had free wifi, where you connect to a hotspot and then are asked to log in. It was great that it was all provided rather than having to ask for the wifi details.
At night, you will find tiny lizards frogs outside, mostly due to the humidity at night, I was also lucky enough to meet a little cat which was scared but I was able to feed it and give it a bit of a pat. The staff were beautiful and always ready to assist with any questions and directions. It's about a 15 minute walk to Seminyak Square, which we found very easy to do even through the heat. There a Circle K (convenient store) as well as on the corner of sunset boulevard there was a small supermarket, burger king and pizza hut.
We would definitely recommend this hotel.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
168,"Worst Villa Experience Ever - Shocking Security, Service & Maintainence",10,August 2015,"My family and I stayed in Bail Rich Villas in Seminyak from 2nd of August to 5th of August.

Firstly the level of noise was an issue from day one. We stayed in the villa right next to the front foyer and the restaurant, that played loud music each morning from as early as 7:30am. We were woken up by the music and had to contact the front desk to have it turned off.

The second point is regarding the poor cleaning service in our villa. When we first checked into the villa, we found a cigarette butt on the lawn, plastic wrappings (it looked like it was from bottle tops), and animal droppings. They also failed to clean up the villa after we had finished breakfast, and we had to ask them to do so when we came back late in the afternoon and found that the dishes/cups from that morning were still sitting there.

Last but not least of all, the two dangerous security guards standing at the foyer. When our taxi driver who took us back to Bali Rich tried to defraud us of money that we did not owe him and went as far as chasing us down the driveway to your villa, the two security guards walked into our situation and literally told us to comply with the driver's every demand, including to pay the driver IDR$100,000 for alleged damages to his vehicle. The security guards knew nothing of the situation, and instead of escorting the driver, who at this point was threatening us with physical violence, off the premises, the security guards immediately assumed that the fault and liability were ours. The dollar value we lost is the least of our concerns - but it's a matter of service and principle that we are most concerned with.

This was my first trip to Bali, and I regret to say that the experience at Bali Rich villa and the encounter involving their security guards have left us utterly disappointed. I will note that the only positive experience I had was my interaction with Budi, who I believe was the manager on duty. He was extremely helpful, always carried a smile and is what I would like to believe a true representation of your organisation.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
169,Nice and Private,40,August 2015,"Got this on a special deal last year and finally took it this year, it is very convenient to all that Seminyak has to offer. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The place is a bit tired and old now, however they were doing a few things to fix it up. Our villa was very good, spacious and clean. The food was not that great, however you have so much choice around you.I would not recommend this place for families however for a couple it was very good and private.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
170,9 days at Bali Rich Villa's,40,July 2015,"Location is perfect if you want to experience Seminyak, with free shuttle to Seminyak Beach, Kuta or Legian.
Large villa with a nice garden and pool, massive bathroom with jacuzzi. You can order your breakfast to your villa every morning and eat it next to the pool.
Inconsistency in housekeeping and the villa´s need to be freshened up.

The staff is brilliant :-)",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
171,Value for money,50,July 2015,"We spent a lot of time choosing a villa. We wanted the villa to be private and not to close the the Main Street. We wanted to be able to walk to eat street(ginger moon,Chandigarh,ect). This place was perfect. We have stayed in a couple of villas in the area and this one is as good as them but just a little cheaper. Had supermarket and 7/11 style shop real close. Food options at the villa where exceptional. We ate breakfast at the villa every day. We ate dinner out but could have easily chosen something different from the villa menu each night either room service or restaurant. The staff are brilliant. Even got money changed off site for me. Used free shuttle every day. Had family staying at another hotel and when they came over they were made so very welcome. Wifi was good. Room was made up when we went out which was convenient. Pool was cleaned daily. Really only one small issue. T.v. In second bedroom only had one English Channel which was sport channel. Not big deal. Didn't go there to watch t.v.
Would recommend this place to others.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
172,Ok,30,July 2015,"We was due to stay for 10 days but checked out after a few days as I originally booked it wanting a public pool as well as a private pool but was told by the maintenance guy that it had been closed for a while. I was really disappointed to find this out once we were there rather than before so we changed accommodation. Personally I did not like the alley/road to the villa, first impressions looked a little scruffy.
The bedrooms and bathrooms were big, bed was high and most of the blinds didn't work properly.
Personally this villa wasn't for me and I don't think it's of a 4 star standard 😟.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
173,Amazing!,50,July 2015,"Villa is perfect, pool is great and breakfast is awesome. Very impressed. The service is great. Close to middle of Seminyak. The villa is very clean and breakfast served every morning with a large choice of dishes.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
174,1st Time Holiday in Bali,50,July 2015,"We had a fantastic holiday whilst in Bali and the Staff and the Accommodation certainly delivered on all fronts. The food was good and the rooms were always cleaned and tidy, however the Staff are what made it couldn't do enough for you.

Thank you",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
175,Best place to stay,50,July 2015,This is our third time staying at Bali rich villas we just keep coming back the place is so good the staff are amazing! They wait for us to come and always chat with us on Facebook the villas are clean the food is the best and the staff make this place into our number 1 place now to stay (this is our 9th trip) do yourself a favour check it out you will not regret it!😍😍😍,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
176,Good stay,40,May 2015,"We booked the hotel for 4 nights,The rooms were very spacious and private pool was also big enough.
The staff were good but not so much friendly as we expected same kind of welcome as in Samaja villa. but it was fine.
The rooms were clean but the pool and kitchen area were not so clean, mainly because of the insects, I hope with proper disinfection the problem would be solve, other wise good hotel and nice stay",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
177,Lavish villas,40,June 2015,"Friendly staff and great rooms. The villa we had was just as promised. Large bedroom with separate dining. Bed was super comfortable. Staff deliver and set up food in the dining room when ordered. Mosquito nets on the bed were very useful, but rooms also had spray and repellant coils for use. Spa treatments were reasonably priced and food was good, especially the French toast for breakfast. Mamasan, a great restaurant, is located in easy walking distance, I would recommend trying this too. Bali Rich Villas also offer shuttles to the Seminyak shopping district, but I reccommend walking as there is plenty to window shop along the way. Great place to spend a quiet few days, private swimming and dining for a honeymoon. Air conditioning and plumbing could use an upgrade but all is in working order. To channels are limited and a bit fuzzy, but you aren't here to watch tv! Was a great place to relax in peace.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
178,Checked Out on Arrival,10,April 2015,"I travelled to Bali recently with family members who had booked three villa's as part of a Scoopon promotion. I booked my two bedroom villa directly with the hotel and choose the two bedroom villa as I was travelling with my 11 year old daughter.

My sister and her family arrived in Bali first and on inspection of the Villa's discovered that they did not have a resort pool as is advertised on their website (since removed). The pool was empty and buiding works were taking place on it. Their Villa was also right next to the building works. This was despite written assurances from them prior to booking that all building works around the Villa's had been completed.

As we were travelling as family and wanted to spend time together having a common area (pool) was essential for our trip. When they asked, they were told that the pool was no in use. As this was important for out trip, they spent the rest of the afternoon looking for alternative accomodation that would accomodate everyone. They left instructions with the Villa's that to advise me on arrival that they had found alternate accomodation for us all.

Nothing was mentioned when I checked in, and it was only when I went looking for the pool to catch up with family and couldn't find it that I asked. I was told there was none. I asked what number Villa my sister was in and was told that she had checked out.

What happened over the remainder of the day and the following day when I tried to get a refund of my money was nothing short of a fiasco. The Villa's were not as advertised on their website, there was no pool for us all to use. Also, the two bedroom villa I had booked meant that you had to go outside (where there is a unfenced villa pool) to get into the other bedroom where my daughter was to sleep. This aspect wan't a problem for me given my daughters age, but would be if travelling with younger children.

To date, I have only received a refund for 5 of the 7 nights I had booked to stay. I have not received any response to the numerous emails I have sent. It should be noted that Scoopon refunded my family members the full 7 nights for each of the three villa's booked.

I woudn't recommend these villa's to families with young children or to groups wishing to spend time together around the pool/bar.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
179,Bali rich villa review semiyank,50,April 2015,Hi i have stayed there for 4 Days. The villa was amazing and big. Staff was very helpful and polite. Food was nice. I went on my honeymoon there hene it was great experience.Very peaceful stay and enjoyed privacy. I can give 9 out of 10.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
180,Had a luxurious stay...,50,December 2014,"We stayed in one of the villas; so reviewing only about that...
This is a beautiful property with very polite & helpful staff. The size of the room, bathroom & pool is amazing. Lavish is the word. The room had all required amenities, induction, etc. Bed was too comfortable and the bathroom had nice toiletries...
The pool was cleaned everyday or anytime, if requested. The breakfast spread was lavish and delicious. The taxi service was reasonable.
No complaints about anything at all. Though a word of caution for travelers, during rainy season & especially in evenings, beware of mosquitoes. There is a lot of greenery around and there can be mosquitoes.
Overall, I am sure, you will have a memorable stay here. Enjoy!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
181,Started on the wrong foot but ended up really well,40,February 2015,"Some things didn't work initially...But when we reported it the manager took action to get everything fixed.
We had a really good time there and glad we were away from Kuta and Semyniak too busy yet close enough to go anytime we wanted to.
Best thing, huge bedroom and bed and large pool.
The Good ""stuff"" really good shuttle, 3 cars. Drivers went out of their ways to be helpful.
Really great service by the staff and managers.
We will go back.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

Amazing service and A grade professionalism.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
183,"Beautiful villas, amazing staff",50,February 2015,"Great location, just far enough away from hectic Kuta but central enough to get around & see the sights easily. Shops & some excellent restaurants are just a short walk away. The villas were spotless, spacious & so beautiful that we rarely wanted to leave! The private pools are ridiculously lovely & the gardens are exquisite. The butterflies & squirrels made me feel like a Disney princess and I'm a 30 year old man.The staff were all amazingly helpful & super friendly, they really looked after us by organizing everything for us, including tours, tickets & transport. They honestly made us feel like the only people there. The food was delicious and the drinks were nice & strong. So well priced too - I've never ordered so much room service before! If we had any questions or issues, they were so quick to help. I honestly miss the place & the people so much already, especially my boys on the bar Dedek & Ari! I have no idea what anyone could possibly complain out, I guess some people are just impossible to please. I'll definitely be staying there again whenever I'm able to return to Bali, counting my pennies already!

Quick message to the staff, thank you so much for everything, from the beautiful rooms to your beautiful smiles, you made our trip so special, it honestly wouldn't have been the same without all of you.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
184,Quiet villas with great size pools,40,October 2014,"Pretty good place to stay. We went with 2 families and asked for villas next to each other which was no trouble.
Rooms are great just remember you need to walk outside of each bedroom into the yard to access each room. This could be an issue with small kids, mine were 14 and 10 so no drama.
Breakfast was great and staff are brilliant.
Room gets filled with mosquito but they don't bite anyone for some reason. Just ask for spray.
Location is okay also. We started for 11 days and took the free shuttle to the beach everyday.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
185,Beautiful place to stay in the heart of Seminyak,50,October 2014,"My friend and I stayed in a beautiful private villa with an amazing pool and lovely big room and bathroom. The staff were all so friendly and attentive. Our plan for this trip was for it to be fun with lots of shopping and partying so this place was perfect for when we wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle at the end of our day.

It was very quiet in October so it's best if you want somewhere relaxing but close to shops and bars. Highly recommended!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
186,Cozy Villa with friendly staff,50,January 2015,"Stay here for 2 nights with my sister. Staffs are friendly and very helpful. Our villa close to restaurant, it is spacious and relaxing with large bathroom and large beautiful bedroom. The private pool is not just plunge pool, we are so happy. The be is clean and comfort which is a must for me because i need good sleep :) wifi a bit slow, but at restaurant is fine. My first breakfast is served at villa, i love to enjoy my breakfast privately and the villa provide a galon or water dispencer which is a big added value for me who need to drink alot. I was a bit worry when read review for annoying mosquito but my night was free from mosquito. I will comeback for holiday!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
187,Villa's need a makeover and a clean! I would never receommend this villa,20,October 2014,"I stayed here back in October with my husband for our honeymoon. I have travelled extensively and work in the travel industry so have experienced many hotels over the years.

First of all, our villa was not clean. The shower cubical in our 1 bedroom villa was covered in old soap scum and rust. The kitchen area was not clean, the wall units were all lopsided and there was a gas bottle thrown underneath the hotplate!! Not safe to say the least. The cutlery and cooking utensils were dirty and not fit for use. Our toilet never flushed for the whole 7 nights we were there, even after numerous complaints to management, it was never fixed properly. The villa was never properly cleaned for the 7 nights we were there, even after repeated requests by us to the cleaners.

Breakfast... there was meant to be ""buffet breakfast"" When we went to the restaurant on the first morning we were handed a menu and told we could pick one breakfast item from the menu each. When I queried about the buffet, I was bluntly told ""no buffet"" We were then forced to pay for extra breakfast as the servings were tiny and the food standard very inconsistent over the 7 nights we were there.

Them there was the building works happening on both sides of the complex, we paid for peace and quiet and that was certainly not provided. In the 7 night we were there, there was also 2 ""parties"" going on in the little chapel next to the restaurant. The singing and music went on for over 5 hours on each occasion. The first time it finally stopped at 11pm, the second incident was during the day. We complained to management over 5 times and nothing was done. Villas are meant to be peaceful, private and quiet!

There is a pool at the back of the complex for the entire villa complex to use, we use to walk past it a few times a day and on many occasions we witnessed local families bathing in it!!! We had our own pool in our villa thankfully as I would never have stepped foot in the complex pool. Allowing locals to use it is absolutely disgraceful and unprofessional. The entire area where the pool is was in total disrepair. Old sun lounges thrown on top of each other, broken furniture.. Was terrible. Always a staff member asleep on an old day bed, was so unprofessional.

After 2 months I am still awaiting an outcome from my complaint. As a travel profession I would never recommend this villa to any of my clients. It is definitely not 4 star. 2 at the most.

Mozzies are also a huge problem in the villas.. and the aircon didn't work properly.

Think twice before booking this property, there are many other nicer Vilas in Seminyak.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
188,Relaxing but too cloistered,30,October 2014,"The staff were lovely and helpful. Our initial room was at the rear, which backed onto a main road - very noisy and dark. The resort is long and narrow. The villas near the front are much nicer and more expensive. We paid an extra $500 for 8 days and upgraded. The villa itself was very nice. Reasonably clean, lots of mosquitoes [and we have stayed in Bali before], the private pool was clean and the lawn area surrounding the pool was great, especially for young families. The spa/massage was reasonable - some staff used mobile phones whilst massaging which was disconcerting. Bali Rich is a good reasonably priced place to stay. Needs major 'uplifting'. Not a luxury place to stay. The main pool and restaurant were closed apparently owned by someone else and staff weren't sure if/when they may reopen. Made the most our stay - enjoyed the pool but the surrounds were too 'dark' and gloomy for me. I wouldn't stay there again unless they refurbish.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
189,Mini Lizzards and Mosquito issue,20,September 2014,"GOOD POINTS:
Breakfast is nice. Choice of having it at the hotel or in the restaraunt.
The staff are really friendly and welcoming.

BAD POINTS:
- The hotel needs a major refurbish. Its not as luxary as it seems.
- There is a major lizzard issue, in the pool area and in the room itself. Also mosquito's everywhere. All day, all night. Only ended up staying for a couple of nights and thereafter moving elsewhere due to the fact it was just really hard to live there with a lizzard issue.
The staff came several times to get rid of the lizzards and then said it was a tropical area so they could not control it. If your used to tropical places and lizzards and mosquitos then the hotel shouldnt be a problem for you. If not, i would not recommend it.

- The surrounding areas for this hotel is not the best - very dark, dingy, rundown and is not the best to walk at night.
- Sidewalks are damaged with big gaping holes in them.
- Main road is busy with cars on both sides (despite being one way).
- Stray barking dogs surrounding the area.
- Strong sewage smell.

More bad points than good hence the reason for 2stars.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
190,A fantastic place to stay,50,October 2014,The staff make the place samudi agus ari dede komang heni ratna budi hendra made the shuttle bus driver they are a superb bunch of staff that make my holiday so pleasureable.the rooms are spotlessly clean the food is great and the service is fantastic,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
191,Very friendly staff but too many mozzies,30,October 2014,Pickup from the airport was punctual and checkin friendly. But upon settling into the room we realised it was swarming with mosquitoes. There was no repellant in the room so luckily there is a supermarket close by. The one room villa was clean but dated. A new coat of paint and maintenance is needed. The room was quiet but a long walk from reception. The breakfast menu is very good and serves quite generous. The complimentary massage was not enjoyable and would not book in for another. My husband actually had bruises down his spine. The concierge and staff are very helpful and assisted us with all enquiries. The pool was clean and gardens well looked after. The price was good but would not stay again until the mozzies are under control.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa

Answer from the Bali Rich Management: But don’t worry we’ll relocated your room( villa) away from construction so will not any noise coming.
Every day, you get a very special, bad smell over the villa.; WLAN with some interruption

Staff, who we get in touch, are very friendly. But the whole villa was dirty and is in need of renovation. Our understanding for luxury is, that almost everything must be perfect. In this resort, we missed the little things to be perfect (already mentioned above).
Bali Rich Luxury Villa and Spa is not recommended for luxury holiday. It's a 3 star resort, but never a first class resort.
The presentation on the internet www.balirichvillas.com is better than the reality.
The hotel is not value for the money. We weren' t totally happy. Why does Bali Rich Luxury Villa and Spa in Seminyak get the certificate of excellence 2014 from tripadvisor? We didn’t get an answer of our email from the management after the 3rd email. Is there a professional management? We definitively can’t recommend this resort.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
193,"4 Star stay - nice hotel,room for improvement",30,February 2014,"We visited Bali Rich Villas Seminyak in February 2014.

We purchased a Groupon deal for $699 for five nights which we thought was okay - wouldn't pay full price for this hotel. We had no issues with booking our accommodation - I just emailed the reception with our details and desired dates and we were all booked in - easy. When we arrived in Bali we were greeted at the airport and provided a complimentary shuttle to the hotel.

While the hotel room is really quiet nice, it is a little outdated and in need of some repairs but generally was a nice relaxing stay. While we were here however there were huge construction works commencing next door which happened to be directly in front of our room. We had excavators and builders looking in from all hours, they start at 6AM in the morning and don't finish until 9PM at night - they just turn the lights on and kept working, This really disrupted the stay which is why staying here was probably on sale - it's not management fault next door is under construction but just a let down when we were at the hotel and we had to keep all the blinds closed and doors shut to block out the noise.

My partner and I did really enjoy our private pool and we had a lovely large bath tub. There is a hotel pool but wasn't the cleanest but you'd swim in your own private pool anyway.

There is an ATM located directed opposite the hotel at the back end (near the hotel pool) at the 7 eleven.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
194,Amazing staff. Lovely stay.,50,September 2014,"We stayed at Bali Rich for 10 nights. This is a lovely comfortable place to stay. Our villa was clean and tidy. Our pool was crystal clean. The breakfast was ok. sometimes we ate at restaurant for breakfast sometimes we ate out. All the reviews you read about the staff are so true. Heni, Linda and Radna were amazing. Nothing a problem . They were amazing with our little boy. Simply amazing. Mosquitoes were a small problem but not as bad as what I read in reviews. We took mosquito coils ( that burn in tin) from home with us. We kept one burning inside when we weren't there. And one burning outside. We sprayed room before we left for dinner every night and we never bitten once inside and only a few outside. But this it to be expected in Bali. It is a decent walk to restaurants but only a few mins on the motor bike or in the shuttle. We will definitely stay here again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
195,It's all about the staff.,50,September 2014,"My fiancé and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago. There is a building site on the eastern boundary, but the villa we had didn't get any noise to worry about.
Our Villa was neat and cleaned daily. The outdoor area has couches, table, gas cooktop and a decent sized fridge to keep a few cold ones in. It was nice to have our own private pool for an arvo swim after coming back from a day of adventuring as well.
The room was comfy and spacious enough for two people. We were provided a can of mosquito spray that came in handy as there are a few about, but you get that anywhere in this part of the world.

My review is titled ""It's all about the staff"", and this is what makes Bali Rich so good. From the time we arrived and throughout our whole stay, the staff were absolutely fantastic. A smile on their faces, great customer service and genuinely nice people.
When we'd come back after a day out, it was like coming back to family. When we checked out they even surprised my fiancé with a birthday cake, which to make a cheesy one liner here ""really put the icing on the cake"".
I can't wait to go back and stay with my Bali family again.. Hopefully a few read this, take the plunge and stay there and enjoy their warmth and hospitality as much as I did..
Cheers..",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
196,Friendly staff but run down,20,September 2014,"My husband andi stayed for a week in Sept 2014. We arrived late at night (early morning) so first impressions were, lovely friendly staff, nice gardens, basic villa. Woke up around 6am to the sound of construction work. Went for lovely breakfast, came back to the villa around 10am after a walk to peace and quiet. The villa was basic and in need of repairs. Went for a massage in the resort, the therapist watch kept catching my back and the sound of a nearby band interrupted the relaxation. When I got up after the massage, the room was filled with Mosquitos and I was covered in bites! Being tired from our late arrival and early wake up, we were ready for bed by 9pm but couldn't sleep as construction work had started again around 6pm. We were told by reception that the work would finish at 10pm however, when I eventually fell asleep just before 11pm, it was still going. The staff moved us the following day but the noise was just as loud and the second villa was in need of more repairs with the towel rail hanging out of the wall, the mirror tarnished etc.

Overall, it was ok. The accomodation was what you'd expect of somewhere cheap and cheerful but really, it wasn't all that cheap so not cheerful! Cleanliness was not a priority either, the first pool was slimy and neither villas, baths, basins or showers were clean. Huge mosquito issue and rock hard bed too. All that said, it is in a family spot and, as previously mentioned, the staff were very lovely and helpful.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
197,The owner needs to spend some money upgrading this place,20,September 2014,"The pluses :-

Other than a messy check-in, which was resolved, I have nothing but praise for the staff at Bali Rich. Lovely people.

Food was ok and delivery was on time.

Airport pick up and delivery all very courteous and pleasant.

The Negatives:-

The villas need an overhaul..especially the gardens which, considering Bali is a tropical paradise, the landscaping here is honestly appalling. The plants are withered, diseased or already in plant heaven.

The wi-fi, to coin a phrase, sucks. Up and down all the time.

Cleanliness is so-so. Dining table, kitchen counters, chairs..all need a good clean. 6 chairs to chose from to dine..not one is clean. Shower....looked really cool..one of those ones with multiple nozzles...except they're all blocked, the handle is broken and twice the thing just decided to explode water from the top of the unit..both times mid-shower.

Here's a tip to management - take off the nozzles, warm up lots of vinegar in a pan and drop the nozzles in and leave for two hours. All the scum and crust is gone and the nozzles will actually emit water.

Mosquitos ...unreal. They should, like every other villa I have stayed in, have a turn down service with the rooms and area being sprayed at dusk and mosquito coils left burning. But they don't. They did lend me a can of repellant which I nearly emptied in 4 nights.

This place has potential...but the owner isn't reinvesting anything to keep it up to par with the other villas, which are all competitively priced. I have been to Bali 31 times..I am not a newbie..so I have the benefit of knowing what villas are up to it, and this isn't. I won't be returning.

If the owner reads this, go and stay at Villa Kubu or Astana Kunti for an idea of what a Balinese villa garden should look and feel like. And do take a shower in Room 209!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
198,Pleasant Stay .. Satisfied,40,September 2014,"It was a great stay in this huge villa.
From the room, living & dining, bathroom and especially the private pool, it was of great size compared to others. Staffs were all very welcoming and they will assist you promptly on your requests. Everyday they will clean your villa or frequent than that if you requested to.
Food was great. Location quite near to central area but needs to take a cab. Villa has free shuttle also but on scheduled timing.
Going to beach needs a ride also about 10mins.

From all the good points above I would say this villa needs a little bit of sprucing up like the lawn, mosquito net,linens etc...
By the way theres a lot of mosquito so be sure to bring lotions or ask additional spray when you run out.

Overall it was a pleasant stay
Worth for what i paid for...",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
199,Excellent Stay - Will be back,50,August 2014,We stayed with our 7 month old daughter and she was so loved by all the staff and we felt so welcomed. We were given great advice about Seminyak and we mentioned we wanted to go to the Bali Safari they organised our driver and pre booked our elephant ride. Also our last night I wanted it go to Jimbaran Bay to watch the sunset and they booked a beautiful table at a lovely restaurant and our driver took us there. It was a great experience from pick up at the airport to drop off. With defiantly return.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa

Only thing we had problems with was the mosquitos. We had to go out and buy coils to try and combat them. And our villa was quite a far distance from reception but otherwise an awesome time.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
201,Good value for money,40,August 2014,"I booked this hotel thru Agoda's 40% discounted price so it was a good deal.

The rooms need to be refurbished but it's not really a big of a deal. The villa is cozy. I would like to commend all the staff in this hotel because they are all so attentive and hospitable. We were having issues with our gopro and they even let us use their computer in the front desk for software updates. We had a problem with the pool and they immediately fixed this. The hotel drivers are also very friendly and would recommend places for us to visit. The location is accessible to the seminyak square where all the stores, bars and restaurants are located. It's just a 5-10 minute walk. Mini marts can be found a few steps away from the back entrance.

I would recommend this if you want more privacy, good location and value for money!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
202,Would recommend this place to families!,50,August 2014,"The villa is great! Perfect for relaxing and travellers who's looking for a quiet place. Its not that far from the main event places but they offer free shuttle services to specific areas. Pool in the one bedroom villa is not that big but the room ang bath tub is big. Im sure you'll also enjoy staying here for days like i did. Btw, hands down for their hospitable service. Very Bali.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
203,Terrible,20,September 2013,"One of the worst villas ive stayed at in bali and yes ive stayed in a few.
Firstly, this was back 3 years ago so things may have changed but, villa maintenance was poor, both air cons broken, room wasnt cleaned properly nor the bathroom.
I wouldnt come back sorry!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
204,Satisfied,40,July 2014,"We were initially a little dissapointed with the villa and thought it could do with a bit of a spruce up (just little things like linen), and extra chairs for outside. However we came to love our stay here and the staff were very friendly, and helpful. It's a great location - supermarket, gelato and nice restaurants near by and close enough to walk to Seminyak. The driver Made is very helpful, and will offer tips. Free breakfast each day was a highlight - so many options and all yummy! Pool was a great size. Perhaps a little bit expensive - but with all the staff hopefully they are paid well.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
205,disappointed,20,July 2014,"we have booked 7 night in Bali Rich Villa in July,
our room was not clean, lot of ash on the bathroom, old cigarettes packs in the bedside table, the bathroom shower was not working properly due to dirt.
then our room was next to a place that was under construction between 8 in the morning till midnight so it makes it very noisy and unconfortable.
i think it's overpriced for bali and better places can be found for that money,
i'll not go back there.
also the food is not great so avoid the room service there...",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
206,An Hospitality JOKE !,10,July 2014,"I had exactly the same experience as Paula V in her previous comment last week with my wife.
This hotel is terrible and I confirmed everything she is saying about the poor cleaning, very dirty pool and the bathroom in terrible conditions still with ash on the floor to mention an example..

I've met the management and they offered me the same deal after complaining of construction noise that was never mentioned upon arrival right in front of my villa every morning from 8am to midnight ! We came to Bali to relax and how to relax if you can’t sleep ? They actually knew that the construction were going on but as the manager told me “ They were waiting for me to complain after 3 days “ Is it a game for them I don't understand ! A REAL JOKE !
We as well asked for a refund and we received the same ridiculous answer - Changing the room + A massage or a complimentary "" romantic dinner "" or to leave and a refund for the 2 days we had left in the hotel. Unfortunately we choose to stay as we didn't want to pack our luggages for and go somewhere else just for 2 nights but I regret it so much .
I explain : A refund if I check out for the 2 night I'm not staying in the hotel ( let me think ? ye this is normal guys are you serious or what ? ) a "" romantic dinner "" ( Even the the local famous dish was terrible what would you propose to impress me if your cooks are not able to do a proper egg fried rice !? )
I personally think that The management should return to hospitality management school and get updated on customer service and how to handle complaints.
In fact it is very simple, you just have to read the Management answer to this complain from Paula V, there is nowhere they apologise or admit their mistakes it's just insane!
Another JOKE : The MANAGER is absent on Sundays !! There is no one in charge to talk to can you believe that ?? I keep talking about the manager but at least he took the time to meet me and hear what I had to say but I think that in all these complaints the worse person is the one on top of every one “ the General Manager “ the one who takes the final decisions. I suggest the owner to start looking for someone else as you are loosing business receiving and treating foreigners this way.
I personally know extremely well hospitality and hotel business management as it is my job and believe me this hotel people knows nothing !
I was checking on their wall close to the reception "" winner 2012 & 2013 for quality customer service "" HAHAHA let me laugh loud and clear !!
I sincerely believe that a lot of comments about this Hotel are fake and written by their team, because it's absolutely not possible to don't see the poor quality of this supposed "" 4 star hotel "" In my country this would be a "" 1 star hotel "" nothing much.
I would never recommend this hotel to anyone at the contrary and next time I come to Bali I will definitely go somewhere maybe more expensive but at least a place that deliver his promises .",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
207,Dont bother. Extremely Disappointing.,10,April 2014,"We had booked this villa for 10 nights for our honeymoon in April 2014 and what a disappointment this place was! If you're looking for somewhere nice to stay - DON'T STAY HERE!

Firstly don't be misled by the word Luxury in the name of this villa, as these were FAR from LUXURY.
Let me outline from the beginning, I’m not one to write negative reviews in fact this will be my first, however after this experience I felt the need to advise others, so they don't make the same mistake we did.
Bali Rich is far from a 4 star resort.

These Villas are old and completely rundown someone looking for a CHEAP holiday and not fussed about accommodation stay here but if you're looking for LUXURY this is not the place.

I wanted to leave the minute we arrived. The villa was dirty, old and falling to pieces - electrical point coming out of walls, couches stained, table cloths dirty, scuff marks on floors, mould in bathrooms and paint peeling off walls. There was a musky smell in the bedroom and a rather offensive smell from the bathroom. The glass tiles in the bathroom had such a thick layer of dust on them – where previous guests had written ‘please clean me’ with their finger. The curtains in the bedroom were broken and couldn’t open/close properly. Poor TV reception. Mosquito net above bed was worn and tattered. Terrible internet reception.
Breakfast dishes sat for hours in villa uncleaned. Most days weren't clean till lunch. Pool water was murky and the surrounding gardens had cigarette butts and beer bottle tops.

Once we notified our travel agent about the state of the villa, it was filled with 5 staff members cleaning it from top to bottom, which provided at least a clean but still very rundown and old villa. We still weren’t happy as the villa didn’t provide the luxury we were after for our honeymoon. I was then shown 3 other villas in the resort to which we could move to, but they were all the same – old and rundown.

In the end, management wouldn’t offer us a refund, which was extremely disappointing. We stayed here for 7 nights, and then forfeited the last 3 nights and booked a wonderful, clean and new villa in Seminyak!
We moved to Villa AVA which was fantastic!! Our previous holiday to Bali 6 months prior we stayed at Villa Kmea (part of the Abadi Villa’s group), which was also a wonderful villa. Either of these two would be my recommendation, offering far beyond what Bali Rich will ever offer.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
208,Lovely place to stay!,50,May 2014,"We stayed in late May, and our only complaint would be the construction that was going on, but that should have finished by now and was hardly their fault! Apart from that, the villa was lovely and spacious, the restaurant served beautiful food, and it was an easy walk into the centre of Seminyak where there plenty of other places to eat too! Fantastic stay, we'd definitely recommend it for a couple to get away from it all, especially having your own private pool to relax in.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
209,excellent accommodation,50,June 2014,"We recently stayed here for 5 nights and a these excellent Villas. Staff are amazing, breakfast is super yummy, location is perfect, pool is very large and private. Food the restaurant is amazing tasty, the price was good as well.
and we sure will be staying again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
210,Private Getaway,40,June 2014,"We recently stayed at Bali Rich as a last getaway before the arrival of our 1st child - so we were looking for a quiet relaxing spot and this was spot on. Good location slightly away from the usual touristy hot spots but close enough to walk down to Seminyak or even Legian. We had a private pool and courtyard whihc was a fantastic spot to lounge around. The room is a little dated and could do with a refresh but was spotlessly clean and everything worked, so no real complaints.
Staff were amazingly helpful and friendly, absolutely no issues there.
Free shuttle buses to Kuta, you do have to Taxi back, but that only costs a few dollars anyway. We also were able to organise one of their cars and a driver for a full day for $60 and had a fantastic trip up into the hills and around Ubud.
For a couples getaway I would highly recommend here. If you're looking to get amongst the party scene then maybe look elsewhere.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
211,I love this place,50,May 2014,"Third time I have stayed, I love this Villa, massive bed, large bathroom, Spa, private pool, Staff and Management are so incredibly friendly and helpful. Free breakfast menu is amazing with so many options., close to everything. Beautiful, huge pool and Bar at rear. Free shuttles as far as Kuta, Free pick-up and drop off to Airport. Food in restaurant is delicious. I would never stay anywhere else.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
212,"Fantastic Villa, the service and staff are amazing.",50,November 2013,"Bali Rich Villas was our first experience in Bali and it was fantastic! The rooms were amazing, we stayed in the private pool villa. However, it was the service and the staff that really made our stay so wonderful. All the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and the service was impeccable.
The accommodation also offers drivers for your needs. There is one particular driver named Made who we requested. He was so friendly and went above and beyond to help us and give us advice.

215,Wonderful stay,50,June 2014,"Picked up by punctual, friendly driver named Made, from the airport who waited patiently because flight was delayed. Along the way he allowed us to grab a quick bite before sending us swiftly to our hotel.
We had a warm welcome by the ever smiling, friendly staff. Check-in was fast and smooth. Stayed in 1 room villa with pool which was clean. Pool cleaning mechanism was not working so we did not swim in it. A staff will come by to light the insect repellent while we were out in the afternoon so you will feel welcomed when you return.
Breakfast at the restaurant or delivered to your villa. Order the night before from their menu. Better than what I had in Seminyak.
Wifi signal is strongest in the bedroom. Auto logout when your device enters sleep mode.
Had painting class with Made on one morning and morning walk on another. Did not try the Spa but swam at the main pool.
Transport to Ubud centre at certain timings. Driver was always puncture for drop off or pickup.
Staff remembers your name. Most of them play dual roles. Like Made, he is the villa driver and painting class teacher.
The villa has freelance driver for day trips if you ask. We engaged our own through internet for more competitive price. Enjoyed our stay thoroughly.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

I must say its my first time overseas and I was pretty nervous on what I would come across but they are very friendly and service is great... my girlfriend and I had some issues with our room not being clean, we had 10 maggots in our room, they quickly gave an upgrade to their best villa, so if there is an issue they will solve it.

Great place will come back here next time, made some friends :)",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

Overall great experience.Highly recommended,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
218,Lovely Experience,50,October 2013,"We had the private villa with its own pool, we got it cheap through Scoopon Travel deal for 5 nights.
We were met at the airport by the Villa's transport, the driver was very friendly. On our arrival staff were very friendly and welcoming at checkin and throughout our stay..
We found out villa to be very clean and set up lovely, had everything that you needed.
Our villa had a huge bed in it, the bath was a spa bath and then outside had own cooking facilities including crockery and cutlery and a fridge.
The villa was cleaned everyday and some days we didnt leave as we just wanted to relax by the pool and on those days they offered to clean room if we wanted.
Had free wifi. Breakfast was included and was served in the restaurant part of the resort and we found it very nice, loved the eggs benedict.
We had a free massage included in the deal and we found to be very relaxing.
We got a taxi to Kuta to do some shopping but it took awhile as traffic is congested.
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend for sure.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
219,very very tired very very Damp,20,May 2014,"Hi we are Con and Lynne a 50+ couple used to the finer things not snobs but discerning. This property shows its age,on check in the toilet still had waste from the prior occupant,after insisting on a complete disinfection two days later the toilet ceased to work ,again a repair was required.We have had to chase towels each day. Don't count on the shuttle service at 7.00pm its always cancelled so budget for a taxi each night.As with other reviewers the staff are great friendly and helpful, the food , Breakfast and a lunch time snack are good.You are a 10 minute drive from the seminyak CBD for shopping and i must say some of the best restaurants we have ever eaten in with a couple of glasses of wine the bill has never been over AUD50 for two the average has been AUD35. Our summary is a great part of Bali far away from the well advertised areas of legian and Kuta just a better class of tourist's and Balinese,we recommend Semiyak as a destination.

We are in fact in house at the Bali Rich as i type this so if the managment wishes to discuss it with us we are here,i doubt they monitor this site.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
220,Needs sprucing up,30,May 2014,"Found a cheap deal on latestays.com and immediately booked the resort. US$300 for two-nights stay with breakfast, wifi, transfer to the airport and taxes included. The resort is about a 10 minute stroll to Seminyak centre, five-minute stroll to Mamasan. Not too bad for the price I reckon.

We got to the resort early, at about 11am, way way too early to checkin which is at 2pm. Surprisingly, the check in was fuss free, and we got keys to our villa. They upgraded us to a two-bedroom villa! They did lock up one of the bedrooms, but we got a bigger pool and living area space! AWESOME!

Ok back to the good first...like I previously mentioned, location was pretty good. not too far from the seminyak town. Just head to the back entrance, turn left and keep walking straight. Across the road from the resort (at the back), is a small mart where you can grab beers, soft drinks and snacks. there's a few money changers too! From the front entrance, across the road, you have the famous Gusto Gelato...try it! It is good.

The villa came with a good size fridge that can easily accomodate your supplies. The kitchen also comes with a cooker hob if you feel inclined to cook...though why would you bother when there's cheap and good food all around!

There was a nice variety of western and asian to choose from for breakie, service was good (everyone had a smile on their face). The air conditioning was great here, kept us nice and cool....

One big warning...buy your own water. Don't use the water dispenser in the villa. The water is full of sediments! We thought maybe it is just the first few glasses....after five tries..we gave up. Good thing we brought along some bottled water. Don't risk it.

So my main gripe with the resort is the wear and tear. Even blinds were broken at certain bits! And it could be cleaner.

Overall, for the price we paid, the resort was fine. Would we stay there again? Maybe....lets see if we manage to score a better deal next time.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
221,Average,30,May 2014,"Firstly I need to say that the service from the staff was impeccable. They do the best they can with what they have. They are prompt, helpful and very polite. However, I was disappointed.

The villa was never ""clean"", with marks on the cupboards, bench tops and doors. The floor had not been mopped for a while and there was hair from the previous occupants all over the floor and behind doors/gathered in corners etc... Even when I asked the cleaners to ""wash the floor"" it was never done and I didn't feel comfortable walking bare foot. There was mould on the ceiling and walls in the shower area and it was obvious that the toilet just got a daily spray (and by spray, I mean with a hose gun style thing) which left the floor around it soaking. The wifi didn't work in the bedroom so we had to sit in the bath to go online!! The garden was very unkempt, and at one stage the pool filter stopped working. It really is in need of some TLC.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
222,Best for honeymooners...,40,January 2014,"We wer there fr our honeymoon...the place gives u privacy and comfort u need durin a holiday..
The manager incharge Sumadi was very helful and quite cooperative when we had sm issues wid the aircon of our room..the issues wer resolved in an hours time durin which we wer pampered wid free massage...nice place and clean...",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
223,Excellent service,40,May 2014,Very good size villas not perfectly made but very nice and relaxed. We had some workers making noise near us most of.the time and we could see them but did not ruin our experience. The staff were some of the loveliest people I have seen. Close to most places or short taxi to them. Would definitely go again. Very moce breakfast.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
224,Comfortable and large villa,50,April 2014,"This is our second stay at Bali Rich and once again found it an extremely peaceful and spacious villa. Location is good with an abundance of restaurants, highly recommend Warisan a 5 min walk from the villas, superb! The meals at Bali Rich are reasonably priced with a wide variety. The breakfast is plentiful and has been extended upon since our stay last year, however you do have a kitchen with cooking facilities in the villas as well as the drinking water fountain.
Whilst there is construction work going on next door do not be put off as you hardly hear any noise in the villa area. The villa pools are kept sparkling and are so refreshing, set in your own garden area. We had 2 separate aircon units in villa, one in kitchen and one in lounge/ dining, which were so efficient, not like most villas where they only work at one inefficient level.
Staff are always friendly in most Balinese accommodation, however we have found that Bali Rich staff exceed what you expect, always keen to learn more from you and no request is problematic and dealt with expediently and with courtesy. The villas will be undergoing some refurbishing, I believe, next year, and yes, some do need a little sprucing up, but we would not hesitate in returning even if this were not to occur. You are welcomed by Henni and Sumardi and a very professional and friendly. Thank you guys for a most enjoyable stay!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
225,Terrible,10,April 2014,"Not clean
Bed sheet is very dirty
Dust everywhere in room and kitchen
To many insects in the pool
Rust everywhere in the bathroom

I don't recommend it",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
226,Worst massage ever....BRUISES GALORE!,30,April 2014,"This place is great if you can get it for a really cheap price, but would not pay top dollar for it because it looks very shabby, old and unloved. Would return only if we got a really cheap deal. Location for us was perfect, away from the heart of hustle & bustle but just steps away from several mini marts, money changer, restaurants & market stalls & a large number of shops & restaurants are an easy ten minute walk away. The ""free"" massage was the roughest and most unenjoyable we have ever had. Asking the girls to ease up seemed to go in one ear & out the other. We were severely bruised for the next few days. Not really what you expect from a supposedly relaxing massage.
The drivers we had were both great, & Made is very keen for people to write good reviews about him on here, & he asked us to write that he is the best.
Reception staff were friendly & helpful.
Cleaning standards here are appalling though, & we seriously did not want to sleep on those filthy sheets, & until several days into our stay the pool was also very dirty....dangerous too with sharp broken tiles on the steps. With some love and attention this place could be amazing. The cleaners really really do need higher standards though, although it may not necessarily be their fault. If they are not given a higher standard to live up to, or cleaner linen to use then it clearly is a case of sub-standard cleaning being the requirement by management, & not the cleaner's fault. A lick of paint, or some bleach & regular cleaning in the outdoor kitchen and living area would make a huge difference, & some bright decorative items would make it look a lot better. It looks old & dirty & uncared for. New cushions, table runners & decorative items on the empty shelves would look fresh & welcoming.
Like I said, if it was a really cheap price we would stay here again for budget accommodation, but calling these villa's luxury is a stretch.
PS....SERIOUSLY DO NOT GET THE FREE MASSAGE, IT IS NOT WORTH THE SUFFERING AFTERWARDS.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
227,Perfection is the word that sums up our experience at The Bali Rich Seminyak,50,April 2014,"This is probably one of the best hotels that we have stayed in so far, in fact the best one, considering the secluded location, the weather and the whole package which comes with it. We were on our first trip to BALI from Australia and we were so glad that we have stayed here. Perfection is the word that sums up our experience at The Bali Rich Seminyak. Perfect location, perfect setup, perfect room, perfect pool, perfect food, perfect service, perfect perks, perfect breakfast, perfect everything.

On arrival we were very nicely greeted. Those cool aromatic towels and an air conditioned car and all those little details which makes you forget a several hours delayed flights, long queue with the Bali customs at the airport and all other inconveniences...and then you have that WOW factor when you arrive at your private villa at night and the area of the villa - all candlelit and perfectly clean and very very cosy. It DOES feel cosy and you will feel at home despite the fact it is quite a big private villa. Oh, i could go on and on about how very nice the villa was.

The major contributing factors were:
Huge room with a lovely day bed with your own private pool with enormous bathroom with two sinks, a shower and a bath, full of aromatic candles and toiletries.
The food. This was something very special. Reading a menu is like reading a book. All very well thought through. And nothing can beat the breakfast being delivered daily with our request.
The place is very secured as well and even the security guards will help you cross the busy road of Bali. They will stop the cars , trucks and motorbikes for you ..what a service!!

The most important thing to me are the staffs like MADE SUANA PUTRA, DEDEX OI and BUDI ASA who knew if and when you would like their help and they make sure they are not overpowering but at the same time they are there for you if you need them. This is to me it's a top-notch.

The service was flawless. The staff knew all our names and addressed us personally everywhere we went. They also have given us their honest opinion on where to go and what not to miss out on.

While this place is an excellent honeymoon location, it's also great for families looking for relaxation and pampering...

Would definitely like to come there again and I have already recommended this place to some of my friends and family. Highly highly HIGHLY recommended!
Thank you MADE SUANA PUTRA, DEDEX OI and BUDI ASA and BALI RICH SEMINYAK for making it a fantastic and memorable holiday for me and my partner.

best regards

228,Needs updating!,30,April 2014,Although staff are very helpful and friendly this place needs major updating. Four times we either had no water pressure in shower etc or no water at all! We were given a deluxe villa but even this ran out of water! Construction site still ongoing next to villas quite noisy and workers can see directly into pool area due to working on roof etc! It's a shame because staff are wonderful and meals/breakfast are excellent !,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
229,We found a treasure!,50,March 2014,"My partner and I had a most wonderful ten night stay in a beautiful 1 bedroom villa at the Bali Rich Villas in Seminyak. The villa had a thatched roof which gave it that traditional Bali look, which we loved. Our magnificent villa had high ceilings, spacious wardrobes and a super large bathroom with a separate shower and a luxurious stone bath tub. The villa was spotlessly clean and a delight to spent some lazy hours in. The King size bed was very comfortable and we had the best night's sleep in it. We spent endless hours in our private pool which was wonderfully refreshing. We loved the soothing sound of the water feature, which we found very relaxing. Everyday we looked forward to the extensive a la card breakfast, which we mostly enjoyed in the comfortable open air restaurant. You can choose from an extensive popular Western breakfast menu and also enjoy a couple of Indonesian dishes. The breakfast was delicious and served with fresh fruit, freshly prepared juice, coffee and tea. The ambiance of the grounds and private gardens is lovely and just the place for a romantic getaway. They have a regular complimentary shuttle service into Kuta and Seminyak, which was very much appreciated. Exceptional good restaurants and shops are only a few minutes walk away. We had a couple of Bali massages at the spa which were very relaxing and hit the spot. What impressed us most was the friendliness and the professionalism of the staff. Everyone was relaxed and very happy and nothing was too much trouble.The restaurant staff prepared a beautiful cake for our travel companion for his birthday and enthusiastically joined in to wish him happy birthday. Everybody made us feel so very welcome. We would like to make a special mention of Ratna at reception and Sumadi the Operations Manager. They both went out of their way to made our stay a memorable one. All the staff treated us as if we were family and we would definitely recommend this little gem, as we most certainly would return to this little Bali treasure.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
230,"WOW,is that our villa..:)",50,April 2013,"The property though a little inside from the main road & when you enter the reception also still you cannot guess what a beautiful place one is is going to experience.Me & my wife chose this property for our honeymoon and we were totally super happy with our choice.The management at the reception was really nice as they upgraded us to a 1 bedroom private pool villa with their compliments.The moment the bellboy opened the viila for us,me & my wife were surely blown away by the sheer beauty of the villa,it was so big with a big private pool,sun bath chairs,a very romantic light effect at night which is worth a mention with the sound of the fountain over the pool was just mesmerizing.The room was spotless clean with a amazing wooden roof throughout the villa,a poster bed,a large bath area with a tub filled with roses-that was a nice gesture.The kitchenette was adequate with all the essentials.The property turned amazingly romantic at nights with all the ambient lights turned on.This is a huge property as our villa was quite near to the reception.They have a beautiful common swimming pool at the back of the property with a pool bar as well serving amazing drinks.The breakfast was promptly served to us at the our private villa itself.Overall this is one villa property which will always be special to both of us,good work bali rich indeed luxury villa management for making our stay super lovely and comfortable.One mention though,our flight from bangkok got late and the driver guy form the villa waited patiently for us for a pretty long time at the airport & he was all happy when he saw us and while taking us to the property he gave us a good brief of BALI.Excellent service guys...cheerss..:)",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
231,Needs a bit of fixing up,30,March 2014,"We stayed at the Bali Rich Seminyak for 5 nights after spending 7 at Bali Rich Ubud. We were lucky to have a room away from all the building next door 105 which was tucked right away from everything. The room, bathroom and pool area were all nice although things are getting old and a lot of work is needed. Also power points are a worry the one by the bed had an adapter in it for the phone and lamp and it kept shorting out plus there was no power point in the kitchen area which made boiling the kettle a problem. The shops and restuarants are quite close although choose your time right as getting across the road is really no fun and very dangerous. For a cheaper week this place is nice and it is nice having your own private pool but I don't think I would stay there again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
232,Bali Rich...A Rich Experience,40,January 2014,"Bali Rich....no words describe the time spent here. Me & my wife had been there in the first week of January for our first leg of the honeymoon. We had booked the 1 bedroom private pool villa for a total of 4 nights. As soon as we entered our villa, we were delightfully pleased to see that the management had taken upon themselves to decorate our entire villa with rose petals.....from our bed, to the pool & the tub. This gesture floored us. It was my wife's birthday during our stay & they helped me in organizing a 5 course candle night dinner (a surprise for her) which was arranged for in our villa itself.
Food at Bali Rich is extremely good....and suits to all people over the world. Particularly the breakfast...which is extremely good & filling with various options to choose from.
The staff is extremely courteous & friendly....and they ensured that all our needs & importantly our privacy was taken care off. They were even helpful enough to suggest a few places which are worth visiting in Seminyak. Me & my wife had tasted a local snack & wanted to take back to India....the staff not only told us were we would get it but also gave a few packets at extremely low prices.
Overall...Bali Rich Luxury Villas is a recommended option for couples....& also for families since they have bigger accommodation as well....A Rich Experience indeed.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
233,bali experience,50,March 2014,"Staying at The bali Rich for 10 days. On arrival the staff were very friendly from our pick up at the airport to check in. We did however have a problem with our accommodation in the first 24hrs of our arrival. My Husband an I spoke with the Manager Sumadi and explained our dilemma. After a very friendly exchange Sumadi resolved the situation in what can only be described as professional. We thank Sumadi as he has guaranteed our stay in Bali will be a fantastic experience.

234,"Old, but clean - needs maintenance- staff great and service great too",30,March 2014,"Our first night was difficult - building works behind our villa 210. Dog barked for hours of early morning. Staff sorted that problem out when I mentioned it in the morning.

Villa is About 300-400 meters from kerobakkan jail.

Bed not bad but I prefer softer rather than firm.

Pool decking uneven and has broken bits. Careful walking on it. Kicked my foot on it and tripped but jutting wood.

Rooms clean. There seemed to be a lot of Mozzies so take cream. Hotel supplies bug spray which helped. Don't think any worse in other villas and areas with mozzies tho.

Doors wobbly or hinge sagged on most cupboards.

Shower looked good in photos but needs a good soaking to get calcium off. Bits broken on most of it. Pressure not bad but would have been better with the shower head cleaned.

Bottled Water supplied as normal. Pool clean and did get sun thru day so not icy cold. Very happy about that. Tiles slippery.

Restraunt dinner was a shocker had one meal there the Seafood platter. And at almost $30 aud a head it should have been way better. The spring rolls however, were delicious!!
Staff exceptional. Always made shuttle service available when we went out shopping or to dinner.

And we did have a good time. We would like more modern and newer villa next time.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
235,"Personal, beautiful and in taste",50,April 2013,"Having spent 4 nights in Ramada Benoa, we stayed for 2 nights in Bali Rich Villas in Seminyak. We took a one bedroom villa with private pool. The whole property is quite aesthetic. Small passageways are made between various private walled villas with pools. The floor, furniture, facilities and cleanliness were quite pleasing. There was a full service kitchen with burner, fridge, microwave, water dispenser, cutlery and dining table. Of the two nights we spent here, we spent 1 day just relaxing in our villa. I didn't try the Spa, but the facility looked good. They have a modest restro-bar at the reception where I had a beer. Unlike a full-fledged hotel, they didn't have a buffet spread for breakfast. They'd take our breakfast order and deliver it in the villa. I don't remember the frequency but they also run cars to Ubud.

This villa is good if you want to relax, without spending a fortune on luxury.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
236,Beautiful Villas,40,March 2014,The villas are absolutely gorgeous. Your private pool is heated and is very comfortable with a door leading straight into your huge shower. Loved the bathroom and the deep bathtub. The staff are very friendly as well :),Bali Rich Luxury Villa
237,"Affordable Price, Excellent Service and Prime Location at Bali Rich Luxury Villas, Seminyak",50,February 2014,"Last February, my friends and I went to Bali for a relaxing holiday. We were really pleased with the excellent service of Bali Rich Luxury Villas, Seminyak with the very friendly and helpful staffs especially Mr. Sumadi, the Operational Manager. It is located at a prime location nearby and minutes walk to various shops along Seminyak, famous restaurants and especially magnificent beaches. We enjoyed the Balinese massage at the Spa, it was superb and we really felt relaxed afterwards. The food and breakfast were outstanding, the Western menu in particular. We went for a tour to Kintamani, assisted by the delightful Tour Division. The driver was extremely polite and drove us with the best possible service. The villa is facilitated with a splendid private pool, exquisite Samsung Smart TV and especially the breathtaking living room area. With the very affordable price, Bali Rich Luxury Villas, Seminyak had exceed my every expectations and I would strongly recommend this Bali Rich Villas to my friends in Singapore and I would surely return during the Summer Holiday.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

239,A great holiday with Bali Rich villas Seminyak,40,February 2014,"Just returned from holiday and both myself and my partner were very happy with our stay at Bali rich Seminyak. We were greeted at the airport by our driver Gungde who we subsequently requested as our driver for all of our tours. He was polite and courteous at all times, commanded a good use of English, and was incredibly knowledgeable of Balinese culture and informative during tours. Our villa was spacious and private, and although there was some construction noise, it certainly wasn't obtrusive to our enjoyment of the villa. We found villa staff to be very helpful and attentive, and the restaurants meals were delightful. I can recommend the lobster Thermidor :) The operations manager Sumadi approached us on several occasions inquiring as to our comfort and enjoyment of the villa and it's facilities, and was receptive to our feedback. awe will most definitely be staying with bali rich villas in the future.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
240,Excellent Staff and cosy environment,50,February 2014,"This is my second stay in Bali Rich Luxury Villa. I asked for the same driver who drove me the last time. His name is Made Suana. He is extremely nice and speaks good English. He helped us to plan our trips and was especially considerate. I went with my grandparents who were both in their 70s. Made would walk a long way from where he parked his car to look for us with umbrellas when it rains. And in planning the trips he would always ask us if my grandparents are ok with all the walking. And when I give too much tip he would even return some to me. If you want a knowledgeable local guide who always puts your concern at the top of his head, Made is definitely one that you can rely on. At the villa, help is always one phone call away. The staffs are always friendly and are really gentle and soft. It adds more to the overall cosiness of the villa. The construction site that everyone is complaining about isn't really that loud at least while I was there. There was no banging or drilling at all. In fact, in the villa that I stayed in (Room 210), I can't hear anything at all. Since I can't hear anything, I can't say exactly when they stop at night. But I'm pretty sure it didn't go all the way to 11pm because as I walk around the villa at night (around 8-9pm), I can see that there were no longer anyone in the construction site next door. (may be they have talked to their neighbours so that they no longer work till that late at night).And breakfast was brilliant! I would definitely recommend my friends to stay there. The staffs make this 4 star villa feel like 5 star.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
241,Off Season Stay-Much Better!,30,January 2014,"My partner & I spent a week in Bali in the off season we stayed at Bali Rich as we got quite a good deal. We arrived quite late at night & were greeted by a lovely man who was our driver at the airport. Upon arriving at the Villa I was a bit disappointed (I was extremely tired) the sheets are grey instead of white they are so used & old (they really need to get new ones), the mosquito net had a couple of little holes & they don’t really scrub away any of the scum in the bathroom. There was a big leak in the kitchen from the sink (I was happy as I could not hear any of the construction going on that previous guests had complained about). But when I woke up the next day we had our own private pool, breakfast was fast & sufficient & the little things that had bothered me the night before were out of my mind. We were in villa 208 right opposite the spa, it was quite & right in-between both back & front exit. (Always exit out the back way its much faster walk to the shops in Seminyak), the staff are lovely, everyone is so nice… so to sum up we had a lovely holiday and for what you pay for Bali Rich is perfect & in the perfect location close to Seminyak square & shops but also far enough out you feel like you have some privacy its literally a 3min walk into town. As we stayed in the off season restaurants, clubs, everything was much easier to get into with NO bookings, I will never travel again in peak season after going when its quiet.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
242,Loud Construction Site Next Door,30,January 2014,"If we new that there was a very noisy construction site next door, we would NOT of booked at the Bali Rich Luxury Villa's. One night they were still working after 3am. We couldn't sit outside, because of the noise and also there are a lot of Mosquitos. When we complained about the noise the staff were very understanding and said they would pass the message on, and management would come and see us. Management never came to see us. Also The Villa's linen needs updating. On the positive side - the Staff was great and Breakfast and Room Service Food was excellent.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
243,"Nice, but .......",30,December 2013,"What a shame this place is next door to a busy construction site. Luckily I was there with just a friend and not wanting a quiet romantic holiday. We were told the noise started at 9am and finished at 7pm - untrue! The place was roaring from 7am to 11pm. It was impossible to relax by the pool as the noise was unbelievable. Yes, the staff are friendly and the accommodation is nice, but there are hardly any restaurants nearby and taxis are required to get anywhere. If you want to be a little isolated and listen to a lot of noise, go for it. It is sad for Bali Rich that this is happening at present.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
244,Amazing - highly recommended,50,December 2013,This was our second stay and Budi at Front Office and his team didn't disappoint. They make every guest feel like they are the only person staying. They cant do enough for you. The villas are out of this world with everything you need including private pool. It's truly A sanctuary away from the hustle bustle of Seminyak. From delicious room service to complimentary transport and afternoon tea the only thing left to decide is when to come back. Thanks Budi. You made our stay very comfortable and special. See you again soon. Jules & Les,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
245,Enjoyable stay,40,December 2013,"Great selection for breakfast, which you can choose to have delivered to your villa. The pool was amazing! Great size and comfortably cool and refreshing.
The villa was fantastic and plenty of room for two people.
The staff were also fantastic and friendly.

I would suggest you ask reception about the free shuttle drop off in advance of the day. As we were a bit annoyed as the driver had told us if we wanted a lift to come down anytime and it wouldn't be a problem to organise. Where as on the day we planned to go into Kuta, we went down to reception at 12pm, and the reception called a taxi. When I asked about the drop off, the man said the shuttle went at 11am and that was it. Unlucky. We didn't bother again.
Just a tip!

We were a little disappointed as during our stay (first week of Dec) there was construction next door, directly opposite where our villa was facing. We understand that construction is part of staying in Bali, but we have never experienced them working until 11pm before and it was really loud banging.
I suppose if I knew that was a possibility we wouldn't have booked, or I would have preferred to have paid less than we did.

Many thanks Bali Rich!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
246,Nice Stay,50,November 2013,"We stay 3 nights at the Villa and the feeling is relax and privacy. My family like it due to the spacious and cleanliness.

247,Don't stay at Bali Rich Villa......,10,November 2013,"After staying at this hotel for one night we tried to checkout with great difficulty as management is very unprofessional, we ended up loosing 2 nights stay however our holiday improved 100 percent as soon as we left Bali Rich Villa.
I wouldnt stay in the Bali Rich Villa for the following reasons;
- both the villa pool and outside pool if filthy
-The towels and linen are dirty
-paint cracking and accommodation requires maintenance in general
-wires are sticking out of sockets
- toilet is leaking
- staff are friendly but not always helpfull
-wifi is slow
- management is unprofessional

Don't stay at Bali Rich Villa's!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
248,Amazing - highly recommended!,50,November 2013,"Boyfriend and I purchased a scoopon voucher for a 7 day stay in a deluxe villa at Bali Rich. First of all I wanted to say how amazing I thought this place was - it felt completely luxurious, the villa is huge and to my standard very clean! (We stayed in 219) I read a few reviews before deciding to purchase the scoopon and was a bit anxious before booking but this place lived up to the pictures and exceeded my expectations.

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful - from picking you up to the airport and dropping you back off, to booking day trips to nusa dua for water sports and going to the zoo, to taking the daily shuttle, calling burger king to place an order for us late at night to fixing any problems we had, they were simply divine!

If i had to be really really picky and give tips on what they could improve on it would be extremely minor things such as sometimes the toilet got blocked (but boyfriend used a whole lot of tissues to begin with so that's not completely the villa's fault and they fixed it immediately anyways) the bathtub took awhile to fill up, and we thought there was buffet breakfast but it was actually a la carte menu in the morning but that turned out to be in our favour seeing as though most mornings we would order breakfast and get it delivered to the villa (talk about service!! oh and the pancakes and steak & eggs are highly recommended). The MAJOR downside was the shared pool out the back - it was obviously not taken care of, it didn't look clean and no one was ever in it. That was a pity as I would have loved to sit and relax out there as the tapas place next to it served amazing drinks.

We didn't have a problem with the location as we wanted to be away from all the main busy areas, and as many people have mentioned kuta is only a $4 bluebird taxi drive away (or free on the shuttle). It was convenient having a little store at the back and pizza hut, burger king and a little shopping centre is only a few minutes walk.

The massage at the villa's spa we had was about $17 per person for an hour and wasn't that great to be honest.. they were way too strong for me (even after telling them to go softer a few times), and I much preferred the local massages which were only about $7 an hour.

In regards to other reviews I have read - I had no issues with hearing planes - maybe my ears aren't as sensitive as everybody elses and there were certainly no rats in the villa - occasionally a few frogs and lizards and jumping squirrels outside at night but that just made it feel like our own little forest. Our own pool was clean and maintained very well by the room service and the aircon was fine.

As you can tell we had an amazing trip, I am still re-living it and dreaming about it at work wishing I was still there. Thank you very much to Bali Rich Villas and the staff - I would highly recommend this place for couples young or old who want to get away and relax whilst being taken care of by friendly caring staff.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
249,Amazing Bali,50,October 2013,"We stayed for 3 night in oct 2013, we opted for villa with swimming pool. Their hospitality is really top notch ,they are really concerned about their customers. From picking you up at the airport, till dropping you back, they take good care of you. We had thought we will organise our trip once we reach bali. We thought we would search around there and see if we can get any local price for the activities which we would like to do. But once we reached their hotel, we found out that they organise tours, We wanted to do white water rafting and roam around Ubud to see the beautiful place. To our surprise we found very good rate thanks to Masri, she really helped us and advised us to go for ALAM white water rafting, I would suggest that you should always go for ALAM only. They are really professional in their approach and take good care of you. We took the SPA facility at the hotel. They provide Happy hour rates for the spa facilities that they provide, As our luggage arrived very late they adjusted our booking for ALAM as per our comfort. We are really thankful to Heny and Ratna for there extended support.
Overall other than food (as we are indian and food was not according to our taste bud) they are great in every aspect for making your tour a memorable one.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

They serve their customers with big smiles and enthusiasm, offering great help when their customers need a favour. Big thank you to the reception staff, kitchen staff and especially our driver - Made Suana.Thanks for your great efforts which makes our family trip so smoothly.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
254,Fantastic,50,September 2013,"We were greeted at the Bali Rich with a smile and open arms. The villa was beautifully decorated and well maintained. The staff made the overall experience even more magical. I would like to say a special thank you to Made our driver, you were fantastic and very informative, you taught my husband and I all about Balinese life and took us to some of the most beautiful places I have ever been to. Budiasa thank you for welcoming us to your hotel, your hospitality outshone that of any other hotel member I have come across and I have travelled all over the world. A special mention also has to go to Airia and Yoga who were great waiting staff. This hotel is in a good location for shops and good restaurants and about 20 minutes from the beach, just perfect!!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
255,Amazing,50,September 2013,"I travel extensively for work and have been exposed to a multitude of both hotels and staff and have to say When being welcomed by the staff at Bali Rich Villas there is an instant sense of relief after the chaos of the airport! - we were greeted with such a warm welcome I felt like we had stayed there a million times before!
Our villa was clean by Bali standards with an amazing pool and probably one if the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.
The food at the restaurant was amazing without the western prices and the staff are some if te most welcoming beautiful people I have met throughout the world- special mention must be made to our driver Made who gave both me and my wife a massive insite to life for a local in Bali!
Cannot recommend this place enough - I have stayed in some if the best hotels throughout the world and during our stay spent the night at Conrad nusa dua for a wedding and can say with total conviction will definitely be staying at Bali rich villas on our next visit.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
256,a good overall experience,40,December 2012,"the entrance was not what we hoped for but once we got inside...it was like wow!!! a beautiful villa!! the pool was not clean..we got it clean>> the room service was nice. the room was very luxurious! but lighting could have been more. it was quiet dull as for the light.we loved the part where we got breakfast in bed n that too the food was according to our taste buds!. overall a nice experience, friendly staff ..a must stay",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
257,Enjoyed our stay,40,August 2013,"Stayed here for 5 nights in August 2013. Had a pleasant stay. Room was spacious and clean.
We had breakfast delivered to our room every morning. Private pool in our villa was excellent. The hotel guest pool however is not used at all and not cleaned. I would not swim in this pool. I never saw anyone, guests or staff in this area. I was happy with staff they were all very friendly and communication was a breeze. About a 10 to 15 minute walk into the heart of Seminyak. 7/11 store at the rear which is handy.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
258,Friendly staff and beautiful villas,40,December 2012,"We booked our holiday from a catch of the day special offer and was blown away by the place when we arrived.
The reception area was beautiful and inviting and the staff were lovely. We had our own private Villa with private pool and it was absolutely beautiful. The room was bigger than my whole house.
We had a bad flood while we were staying there and our room got flooded, but the management and staff had found us another room (upgraded) and had us moved within a couple of hours while they were trying to sort out other floods around the resort. The flooding occured all over Seminyak from some very heavy rain and they managed a hard situation very calmly and quickly.
The food was amazing, we ate at both restaurants and got room service a couple of times and every time the service was great and the food was delicious.
The Villas were in a great location, close to shops and we could walk easily. It is also out of busy Kuta making our stay in Bali more enjoyable.

I would stay here again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
259,"Bali Rich Villas ,Seminyak",40,August 2013,"My partner and i stayed for 7 nights at the Bali rich hotel in Seminyak.We had a wonderful time there, the breakfeast was nice fruit and juices, also a wide selection for all meal times.Everyone at the villa was more then happy to help us there, and were able to organise everything for our trip through the villa.We met someone named Made Suana Putra , he works at the villa and was our driver.Made was helpful in what ever way he could be of assistance.He has a vast knowledge of Bali, i highly recommend Made Suana.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
260,Half lovely half ugly,30,January 2013,"I had never been to Bali before and was a bit shocked at the lack of street presence, there are two entrances to this complex. Neither are all that inviting but the main one where the taxis take you is the best...the staff are beautiful and quickly take your mind off the entrance. The other entrance is a disaster with a pool I wouldn't let my dog swim in and some kind of bar which seemed to be a local hangout for staff and friends. The staff at this end were completely different to the main entrance...weird. We had a one bedroom deluxe villa and I wasn't dissapointed. There was a funny sewerage smell though which we got used to. What are you going to do? It's Bali! Although the pool wasn't the prettiest colour it was clean enough to swim in. The sun lounges and deck with umbrella are all worn and need maintenance and freshening up. There were spots in the bathroom that with a bit of attention would have made all the differenceZ it's one of those sutuations where at a glance the bathroom looks nice but up close a bit unfinished. Also thought we were going to get a bath with jacuzzi bubbles and small tv but it was just a bath. The bed is super comfy and I had the best sleep! Needed the mozzie net as there was one or two buzzing around at night. Don't make the same mistake I did on sleeping right under the air con on high as I got really sick. I hurt my leg horse riding and could hardly walk. I also lost my credit card in an ATM and the staff did nothing to help. I found it was better to do currency exchange at the front counter. They had a good rate and no commission. They also had a free shuttle to take you into town. About a 10 min drive from ku de Ta and potato head. Right near kerabokan jail. Serene and quiet in the complex. Food nice, we always had room service, hardly anyone ate in the restaurant. There was no atmosphere there. Breakfast was small and coffee/tea always too cold. But nice. Service from staff great, little bit of a language barrier. Good laundry service and on site spa not bad. The menu for it is halarious with one service saying a treatment was ""good for your hairs"" . To sum up we got a good rate because it was quiet, the weather was too muggy. Bali rich villas was nice to come back to and I would stay again but only if I couldn't get a better deal anywhere else.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
261,Wonderful service,40,August 2013,"We stayed for 5 nights.
The service is beyond amazing great prices within the hotel! The disappointment was we could not use the main pool due to it being green and also not being able to have our free dinner at the restaurant near the pool as it always seemed closed at night. The villas themselves are clean and tidy but they seem to be needing a little attention due to ware and tear.
But over all we loved our stay!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
262,Absolute Rest & Relaxation,40,July 2013,"If you are after peace and relaxation in your very own private villa and pool with only a short distance to all the actions and good food in Seminyak, this is the place for you! The staffs are very friendly and very eager to serve but respectful without being intrusive. But, you have to stay in the Deluxe villas as they are much newer and better than the Classic villas which are old and not very well maintained......seems like the Management are putting more efforts in maintaining the newer villas. Their Operation Manager,Mr. Sumadi was very gracious to upgrade us to the 2 bedrooms villas which were huge and gorgeous when our Classic villa were having some maintenance issues. The main pool should not be mentioned as part of their facilities as it is not well maintained with algae growth at the bottom and the smell of food waste and rubbish are all around. The loungers and furnitures are weathered and tired looking and were not even arranged properly! I was told the responsibility of this section of the building belongs to a different management which seems to be a staff mess and does food catering business (hence the smell of food waste). I had the unfortunate experience of swimming there once and very much regretted it after being hit with the horrible stench at the other end of the pool...came out and showered immediately! Lastly, housekeeping cleaniness needs to be very much improved! However, the stay in the Deluxe villa more than made up for this!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
263,Bali rich luxury villas seminyak,40,July 2013,"Our first trip to Bali. We travelled to Bali for a friends wedding. We chose to stay at Bali Rich for 7 days using a scoupon voucher.
We were met at the airport by a driver who delivered us safe and sound through the crazy hectic bali traffic with the liberal use of the car horn. I have never seen so many motorbikes and scooters.
Bali Rich - Excellent value for money. Decent food. Surroundings were lovely. Service awesome and all the staff were very accommodating and friendly. There was always a hello and a smile. Buffet breakfast Friday to Sunday. Loved the American breakfast. 2 bottles of water supplied to the room each day.
The one disappointment was the villa. The section we stayed in was in need of repairs and a refurbishment. We were in 101, a small villa at the back entrance, near the pool.
Several friends were staying in the villas closer to reception. These villa were larger and in excellent repair.
Bali Rich tour drivers very knowledgable and were willing to drive us anywhere we wanted to go. Unfortunately we were unable to use the Spa, although our friends also staying at Bali Rich did use the Spa and said the girls were great.
We loved to see the little squirrels running through the trees and gardens....Look out for them.
There is an awesome French restaurant close by...out the main entrance and turn left, less than 2 mins walk away. Also a small supermarket out the back entrance to pick up the essentials such as lollies, toothpaste, water and beer.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
264,great trip,30,July 2013,"me and my partner stayed here for 11 nights it was a nice place with only a few things that were a disappointment, our pool had a lot of green algae and I asked a few times for it to be cleaned but the algae always remained. I would recommend that the villa take a closer look at the cleaning of their pools as this could be a health danger we just never put are heads under the water in case .. the lobby toilets also need to be looked at as I found them to be very dirty and the food at the restaurant a bit expensive ... but we still had a great experience the staff are very friendly and accommodating to your needs the villas are clean in side as well . we stayed in room 219 21/07 to the 01/08

the villa is in walking distance to shops and eat street which we found handy or if you want a taxi it will cost you about $1.50 to $2.50 to take you to seminyak square if the shuttle is available they will take you for free this was handy as well

thank you to all the staff for being so accommodating",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
265,Amazing!!,40,September 2012,"The hotel is beautiful, we had the honeymoon villa which was gorgeous. The only issue we had was with the breakfast, the breakfast was à la carte. My husband and I, both love buffets so we were a bit put off with it. Otherwise a great place , especially if you are looking for a private romantic stay.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
266,"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous... We'll be back!",50,May 2013,"Tucked away in the middle of Seminyak we enjoyed this Oasis of pure relaxation. The staff were fantastic... Looking after our every need and want. A special mention to Agung who drove us to Ubud and told us so much about Bali, it's customs, people and traditions. Well done, guys..... Fantastic place to stay. Dave & Jackie, Room 216 May 9th to 20th, 2013.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
267,"Great place, fantastic staff!",40,July 2013,"My partner and I spend 7 nights in a classic pool villa at Bali Rich (Scoopon purchase) and from the moment we walked into the foyer, we were greeted with a warm smile and made very welcome, which continued throughout our stay.
Ratna at reception and her fellow staff were terrific and very helpful with any request like restaurant bookings etc and Masri, who organises the many tours and activities in Bali was very knowledgeble, helpful and organised.
From what I saw, the food was also good, if our daily breakfast was anything to go by, great variety and quality.
Our villa was clean, comfortable and everything was in working order, having our own pool was awesome to just cool off at anytime and have the privacy.
For a relaxing, private getaway, this is the place!
A couple of tips: There is a local supermarket 300 meteres away from the front entrance (walk out, turn right) in between the bread shop and Burger King with everything you need at local prices.
The money changer located 20 meters from the rear exit of the complex is reliable, you get a receipt for your purchase and there is no ""funny business"" MK",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
268,Nice private escape....but....,30,July 2013,"My wife and I spent a week here in a private villa as we purchased a scoopon voucher. the resort is located around a 10 minute walk from the main shopping/ restaurant area in Seminyak. If you want to travel into Kuta it can take anywhere from 45 mins to an hour due to the crazy traffic.
The resort runs a free shuttle three times a day or you can catch a taxi which will cost you around $3-$5 Australian to get into Kuta.
The room itself is HUGE, you have your own kitchen, private pool, the bathroom as just as big as your room... The air con is always on in your room which is also good.
We only ate at the main restaurant once, nothing to rave about. You can chose to have breakfast delivered to your room each morning or eat at the restaurant. There are SO many Mosquitos so bring insect repellant, they do provide citronella coils, bug spray and the bed also has a mosquito net but we still got eaten.
Overall the resort itself is great if you want to relax in your own villa and be away from the busy areas of Bali BUT be prepared to have to either jump on a scooter/ catch a cab to get to shopping and different places to eat out.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
269,bali rich,40,June 2013,"We had a week at the Bali Rich in Seminyak and although a little run down and a little out of town the surroundings, our own private pool, the staff, the food was excellent.
You needed a driver to take you to town (or a short walk) and it was never a problem at whatever time. The last shuttle down was 7.00pm and you caught a taxi back for less than $5 *Aus.
If you want the quieter side of Bali this is it as to stay in Kuta is just too much for people our age (60,s), that,s for the young kids.
Shopping in Seminyak is first class but Kuta is for markets and bargening.
But very hot and humid, be prepared to sweat a lot.
But all in all the Bali Rich was a good experience for us being first timers to Bali..
Complements to our driver who we called M1, nothing was a problem and he was any extreemly nice guy to top it off.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
270,The staff at Bali Rich obviously took on board your earlier feedback posted here because we had a nearly perfect experience.,50,June 2013,"We stayed at Bali Rich Villas from 7-14 June in a one Bedroom Villa with a private pool.

The public pool was clean and blue. Dae was a wonderful host at the pool. Our room was clean and all our electricals worked perfectly. My only request would be that they clean the fly nets around the bed. Especially the top of the net.

They provide a very generous shuttle service 3 x a day to Kuta and Seminyak and their drivers are available for tours at good rates. We copied the path of other tours we found in brochures for half the price. We also liked Made (pronounced Mah-de).

Location is good. Grocery store across from the rear exit and post office next door. CBA is up the road in an AlfaMart (7/11). Taxi to Seminyak is accepted at $2 (20,000). We got from Kuta for $5. There is always traffic jam.

We met a returning guest who loves the private outdoor space with each Villa. It's great for families.

Staff was great. They tried very hard to make friends with our grumpy toddler and in the end he accepted Made. The Spa was lovely but I didn't try others so can't compare.

We ate in quite a bit because of our baby and enjoyed their traditional banquet the most (voucher meal). Our favorite Italian was Trattoria in Seminyak. Great coffee at KU DE TA, The Deck and Potato Head (arrive at 11am for a beach bed)

If you have kids you must go to Waterbom World in Kuta!!!

Ubud and Uluwatu were my favorite tours for their natural and traditional features. Always allow an extra hour to get back especially if going to the airport although check-in is more relaxed.

Thank you to Bali Rich for a positive experience.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
271,Best Villa,50,June 2013,"We have just returned from staying in a 2 bedroom villa at the Bali Rich Villas in Seminyak, our experience was 10/10 the staff were so helpful nothing at all was too much trouble. I will definately stay there again and again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
272,A very relaxing time in Ubud!,50,June 2013,"The staff at Bali Rich Luxury Apartments are a credit to them. They help make the villas the success they are. We checked in for five days and were impressed! Having the option of having breakfast in the villa or in the restaurant is a nice option. Of course the villa won hands down. Also having a restaurant, so you didn't have to venture out if you didn't want to.

Free afternoon tea, is a nice option if you are around too!

They offer free shuttle buses into the township every two hours, or if you like to book your own, this could be organised for 60,000idr, roughly $6.

I would certainly recommend Bali Rich for a few days up north!!

Your own pool is nice too.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
273,Fabulous staff,40,May 2013,"Our stay at Bali Rich Villas was our first trip as a couple and we could not have asked for a more friendly and relaxed holiday. The staff were exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. The villas were amazing, although a ""tired"", but very clean and the bed was so very comfortable! Having the privacy of your own pool to laze around felt very decadent! Food was also very good. Big breakfasts to start your day which included fresh fruit and juice (and by the way, don't worry about the ice in drinks.... we had no issues at all and we had ice in our drinks wherever we went!). Thoroughly recommend these Villas to anyone going to Seminyak.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
274,Luxury Paradise Room 206,50,May 2013,"We stayed at the Bali Rich Villa for 7 days in Deluxe 1 bedroom Villa with a private pool. The hotel arranged for a driver to pick up us from the airport in the airconditioned van and drove us straight to our hotel. The drive was approximately half hour. Upon arrival, the friendly staff greeted us at reception with an amazing refreshing mococktail. The foyer was very clean and well maintained. Once we got the keys to our room (206) which was also close to reception (but by no means noisy) we opened the door, and were left speechless! We fell inlove with the pool!! It looked absoloutely amazing, great size, clean, beautiful plants and trees. We had a spacious bathroom, the deep spa had a tv, and a seperate shower. The bedroom had a king bed, built-ins and flatscreen tv. Seperate aircon units in each room. The kitchen had a small cosy dining area along with a small lounge and was self contained with doors opening to the courtyard. Staff were always courteous and willing to go the extra mile to help and accommodate us.

The only thing i would recommend is just a refreshing paint job however it didnt affect our overall experience.

Hotel is close to shops its about a 10min walk to the main shops at Seminyak.

We highly recommend you book into the day spa at the hotel. We had the luxury pampering package of 3hours,, the girls did an amazing job with massage, facial and body scrub and more which left us totally rejuvinated and all for a great price. Dont waste your time looking for cheaper deals elsewhere as you will most likely end up very dissatisfied.

Overall, we had an amazing experience and we will do all over again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
275,luxe is the word,50,May 2013,"fantastic villa's, amazing view from the pool and restaurant. Just outside the tourist area of Ubud, but the free shuttle makes it perfect for a cultural and relaxing holiday on Bali. Very friendly staff (Made Sken, Ekawati & the rest of the crew are always helpful and smiling). Very big rooms/villa's, personal pool, lovely garden,...",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
276,Great place to stay,40,May 2013,We recently stayed at the Bali Rich Villas in Seminyak for our 20th wedding anniversary. The villas a really comfortable and relaxing. It was great having our own pool. The breakfasts are great and we loved the plate of fresh fruit every morning. The staff are fantastic and nothing was too much trouble. Close to main part of Seminyak. Thank you for a lovely stay!,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
277,"Lovely relaxing stay, great staff :)",40,May 2013,"My boyfriend and I just got back from a 10 night stay at Bali Rich in a one bed Deluxe villa and it was really lovely. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the villa we stayed in was huge and quite modern and clean. It was really lovely to have our own pool that was cleaned every day. We had a driver called Made who drove us to Ubud and he was absolutely lovely and offered to take us to sites that weren't part of the organised tour. The food was pretty nice too, we only ever ate breakfast there and they had a few options, like bacon & eggs, eggs benedict, pancakes, cereal, toast, and always with a plate of fresh fruit :)
The location is pretty good, bit of a walk (about 10 - 15mins) to the main eating and shopping streets but that didn't really bother us, (just a bit risky and crazy crossing the streets but i guess most of bali's like that!) A new restaurant called Mama San (indian food) is very close though, about 500m from the back entrance and its absolutely delicious, some of the best food we had there! Yet i think next time we'd stay closer to the beach or seminyak square.
The only thing was though, we were staying here through a scoopon deal voucher which was for a classic one bed villa, yet the resort said there were no classic ones left for the time frame we wanted to stay, so they asked if we wanted to upgrade to a deluxe villa for an extra $60/night,which we agreed to, BUT when we staying there we barely saw anyone staying at the villas, probably saw 3 other couples the whole time we were there and there was never anyone in the restaurant/bar/main pool, so I'm not sure how all the classic villas were taken!? Don't know if this was to get more money out of us!?
There was also construction going on right next door and huge cranes we could see from our villa, which would both occasionally be quite loud, but not all day/night.
Also although the bed had a mosquito net, it would be great to have fly screens in the rooms because there were heaps of mosquitos in our room all the time and we'd wake up with bites every morning!
Overall though, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend bali rich to anyone looking for a relaxing holiday who doesn't mind being a bit further away from the beach or main streets of seminyak.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
278,Lovely stay,50,May 2013,"Me and my wife just checked out from the hotel. And i would like to thank all the staff that made our honeymoon so memorable...

279,Homely Abode,40,May 2013,"We went to Bali Rich Luxury Villa recently (May 2013) for our honeymoon and stayed there for 6 days. The villas are really nice with comfortable bedding and a total privacy to enjoy for. We booked a 1bhk private pool villa which had a separate living room and an open kitchen . Bathroom was very spacious . Hotel's food is amazin n they serve sumptuous breakfast . The only minor glitches were absence of any full length mirror in the room and poor locking system.However hotel's staff was very courteous and ready to help in making all your booking and travelling arrangements within Bali.
Overall it was a nice and relaxing place to stay.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
280,Love this place,50,May 2013,"We are here for 10 days they have all gone so far out of their way for us my hubby was sick they not only drove us to the Dr waited for us then brought us back, next day we received a large basket of fruit tonight they organized a romantic dinner for two at our villa they have taken us out on any occasion and waited. They are so friendly and beautiful really need to come here. Nothing is too much trouble, never had so much fun n been so well taken care of thank you all so much...back as soon as we can.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
281,An Oldie but a Goodie,40,May 2013,First let me say I was staying at the Bali Rich Villa on a voucher so much reduced price. I loved the location - very close to the high end shops and restaurants in Seminyak - walking distance to Seminyak Square. Villas are older style but well cared for. Our pool was very clean and well kept. The room was a little run down but super clean and linen was very fresh. The security was excellent. Share pool and restruant were really nice and breakfast was cooked for you each morning from a menu. I really liked ti bali Rich just for convenience and cleanliness. If you like all the modern Bali look this is not the place for you but if you like a more traditonal place you'll like Bali Rich.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
282,Loved it,40,April 2013,"We stayed here for 3 nights, and my hubby and i loved it. We had a one bedroom pool villa, large bedroom, large bathroom and beautiful pool. Free shuttle to take us into Kuta/Legian/Seminyak. Cleaned every day, had breakfast bought to our room. The staff were always cheerful and very helpful. Would stay here again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
283,"Last minute easter escape, incredibly lucky to stumble over bali rich villas",50,March 2013,"Great for a relaxing romantic getaway. Great villa, lovely staff, best massage ever on site. A little way from the busy hustle and bustle of central bali, but we enjoyed that. On the edge of seminyak... Would highly recommend......................",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
284,unforgettable experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,50,April 2013,"My husband and I stayed for eight days at the Bali rich luxury villas in Seminyak and experienced the best holiday ever. The villa was extremely spacious, clean, modern, within walking distance to major shops, yet peaceful and private as we had hoped for. The bathroom with the huge spa was enormous. We had our own private pool which provided hours of relaxation. The staff were exceptional. The Operations Manager Sumadi displayed a professional attitude which was second to none, while Budi and Ratna at the reception were always very pleasant and courteous and delightful to talk to. The restaurant provided excellent breakfast every morning as well as lunch and dinner, and Sudiasih and Yoga attended to us with a beautiful manner which is to be commended. We were provided with a free drop- off service at Seminyak, Kuta and Legian whenever we requested it. The driver Made Udang was very impressive and knowledgeable. All staff went out of their way to assist us and provided their services with a lovely smile which made our stay there a very memorable one. We have already recommended the villas to our relatives, work colleagues and friends. As for us, we will ensure that our next stay at the Bali rich luxury villas( in six months time) will be a much longer one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
285,"Most Relaxing, Friendliest Place I have been to.",40,April 2013,"We just spent a week there and loved it. The staff were outstanding, the service/food brilliant and any attraction we wanted to see, they booked (if required) and arranged a driver to take us. We cannot get a taxi in Melbourne, Australia to take us anywhere for $40 in less that an hour, yet that is what it cost for a driver for 5 hours! If you can get an older, more knowledgeable driver like Maddy (who works for Bali Rich Villas), he points out interesting things on the drive. If you get Putu (who seems to be an independent driver), he spends 90% of the drive on 2 mobile phones alternately chatting to anyone except his passengers! A little bit nerve racking when travelling at 80-100kmh (the only time we actually got up to that speed) and he's arguing with his girlfriend on the phone!!! Ask if an employee is available to take you on day trips. We loved the geckos and frogs that came out at night at our unit and the sugar gliders (hubby called them tiny squirrels) that entertained us during the day. Only minus was some minor maintenance in the unit we were in was required......extremely wobbly power point that was nearly falling off the wall. The staff who make up the rooms do just that. They don't check for anything that may be faulty. Lovely place to stay.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
286,Excellent Accommodation,50,April 2013,"Just left after 6 nights celebrating our anniversary. What a fantastic place. The 1 bedroom villa was huge, clean and very well appointed. It was kept very clean and tidy. Having your own private pool was wonderful. The rate was extremely cheap compared to a small one bedroom hotel room. The staff were ecellent and coudnt do enough to assist/help. We missed the regular shuttle a couple of times but that was no problem they simply had a staff member leave what they were doing to drive us. Highly recommended and such great value for money all round",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
287,Nice but not amazing.,30,April 2013,We have just recently returned from a week long stay at Bali Rich Villas in Seminyak. We stayed in a two bedroom villa. While our villa was nice it was a little old and our pool area was pretty drab. The tiles in our pool made it look more like a pond than a pool. After looking back at the photos none of them look like our villa did. We were also a bit out of the main Seminyak area (across a main road) and couldn't get anywhere without a short cab ride. The staff were friendly and couldn't do enough to help us and our room was clean except for a few minor things. I thought our villa was going to be amazing but it was just ok. We left a little disappointed.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
288,Beautiful Staff,30,March 2013,"Hubby and I recently had a 5 night stay with our scoopons voucher. There was a slight mix up with dates but the staff sorted it all out and there were no problems.
We stayed in a one bedroom villa for 4 nights and a deluxe villa on our last night which was just lovely, more spacious and a little bit more luxurious.
Breakfast was lovely and the staff were always friendly and smiling. Hubby loved the pancakes but I wouldnt recommened the pastries as they were reheated and soggy and or chewy but everything else was good.
In our 1 bedroom villa we had curtains that didnt block the light out so no sleep-ins as the sun came streaming thru but the deluxe villa had blinds that blocked out all light. A few differences between the villas. I would recommened staying in the deluxe villa",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
289,Exceptional service,50,February 2013,"We recently spent 5 nights in a 1 bedroom villa and were thrilled with every aspect of the villa and wonderfully exceptional staff. The villa was extremely comfortable, spacious and spotless. Staff have excellent English are helpful, courteous and endeavour to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. The surprise birthday cake that the chef baked was so thoughtful and made his day!
We will definitely return to these villas on our next trip, thank you to all the staff, you do a fantastic job.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
290,Relaxing,40,February 2013,"My friends and I stayed here in February in 2 one bedroom pool villas. Great experience from start to finish....met at the airport, welcome drink on arrival and fast check in which had us settled into our villas very quickly! Staff were very helpful and spoke good English and the shuttle service was fantastic, which we used most days to be taken to either Seminyak or Kuta. Good breakfast choice from a quite extensive menu which can be served in your villa which we did most mornings. The restaurant at reception had a tasty tapas menu which can also be delivered to your villa. Overall a great place to stay with friendly staff, would stay here again if revisiting Bali!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
291,Honeymooners Paradise,50,April 2012,"I went on my Honeymoon to Bali Rich Villa and stayed in a 1 Bedroom Pool Villa. We were welcomed to Bali in the Airport by our Driver 'Giddy' who was a very Friendly and Helpful Guy. We were served some Welcome Drinks upon reaching the Villas. The moment we entered Our Pool Villa, i was flabbergasted by its beauty, spacious and luxurious looks. The Bedroom was Huge, the Lawn was Big, the Private Plunge Pool was excellent and the Bathrooms were Huge as well. Even though food wasn't up to our Liking since We Indians like it Spicy, But the Breakfast was to Die for. The quality and quantity of the breakfast was amazing. The Best part was the Chef would come into our Villa and prepare the Breakfast right in our Kitchen and serve it fresh and Hot. The Staff was very kind and helpful. The Spa we took was also very good. Over all we had a great 3 Nights stay here. Although I would have expected a few more surprises from the Management since it was our Honeymoon, but it was awesome. I would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Bali for a great time.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
292,"Good Resort, but you have other options...",30,March 2012,"Seminyak and Kuta is where the most quintessential intineries of Bali converge. Surf, Sand and Sun. So it isnt hard to find stay accross a range of options - from private villas to resorts.

My wife and I stayed at Bali Rich villas towards the end of our 10 day stay in Bali (we earlier stayed near Sanur and at the delightful Ubud resort of Kamandalu). Perhaps our expctation and stay (and thereby this review) has been influenced by the previous places we have stayed in.

Seminyak is more upscale than Kuta (including the shopping and beach area). Bali Rich villas is situated within a by lane that connects to the main road within a seminyak neighborhood. A series of private villas, there isnt a 'view' to offer since it isnt close to anything scenic. The villa is large - with a sitout and mini kitchnette and a very large bathroom - perhaps the equivalent of a room itself. However, we found the bathroom had an ants issue (understandably so if you consider that there is a lawn within the villa). The pool was relatively smaller than what we had expected and the water was heavily chlorinated - so don't swim without proper eye gear if you want to avoid the sting.

The service was - non intrusive. We stayed only for 2 nights and found the staff was quiet - none of the smiling hospitality we had experienced in other hotels in bali, but neither was it cold shouldered or unresponsive - it was, for lack of better words competent. The food was nice considering vegetarian options and the check in and check out was very efficient. For the price we paid, we could have found other options - infact many. But as with many options, it often becomes difficult to ultimately distinguish one from another and hence I would rate this as 'ordinary'. They offered a drop shuttle but no pick up shuttle - while the market isnt far, it is big from start to end. You will find plenty of places to eat around and shop, so do experiment around (the entire purpose of being in Seminyak is just that!).

I wouldnt go back - not because it was a bad experience, just that we had better experiences elsewhere in Bali.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
293,Bali awesome,40,January 2013,"From the start of our trip my partner and I were made to feel so welcome by the hospitality shown from all the staff at Bali rich! Special mention to our driver, Made, who took us on a day trip and helped us appreciate Bali even more with his kindness, well spoken English and knowledge of the culture.

We stayed in villa 101 which was at the other side of the complex, and was very close to a decent money changer and a good little mini mart.

We would definitely recommend Bali Rich Villas to family and friends, our experience was a very enjoyable one. Thank you to all the staff at Bali Rich.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
294,PEACE & TRANQUILITY in BALI,50,December 2012,"This was my second time @ Bali Rich Villas and I was delighted to see the same fantastic Staff still working hard!
Having just returned from a busy USA trip to find Sydney wet & raining, on impulse I decided to get away to revive for the forthcoming fabulous Festive Season. So off I went.
Delighted to see Made still the driver there to meet me at Bali Airport; an extra surprise was that ""Budi"" had come along to welcome me again... a fantastic start! I finally met the all helpful ""Fenny"" who arranges accommodation on behalf of Bali Rich - a fantastic professional in stilletto's! I can't praise the staff enough - the small Restaurant has good food & terrific staff... there was a lovely new gentleman working there; they are all an assett to the Resort.
As previously I had the 1 bedroom/1bathroom Villa with its own pool. These Villa's are brilliantly appointed with a king-size bed in an enormous bedroom, with a Lounge/dining on one side and the bathroom (with spa) on the other. I spent most of the days by the pool finishing a trilogy of novels and getting a tan. Most evenings & nights it rained, but was always bright & shiny the next day. WORTH MENTIONING is the SPA. Ask for YuYung for a facial or massage. I went back 3 or 4 times! By the end of my stay with Mr. Prawn my return driver, I left Bali, yet again thrilled by the excellent Staff & the privacy I enjoyed in this ""getaway"" !",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
295,Bali Rich Villas= Fantastic,50,December 2012,"I cannot recommend this place highly enough, it was everything we could have hoped for, and more, it far exceeded anything that I have ever experienced or could of imagined. It was absolutely perfect in every way. It has spoilt me, from now on I am going to expect this wherever I stay. The staff are the most beautiful people that I have ever had the good fortune to meet. They did everything possible to make our stay the fabulous experience that it was. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even down to the little things such as tuning the tv to dvd, they never made me us feel like we were inconveniencing them, even though it was such a simple thing, i'm not good with electonics,lol. Food was also divine, not one bad meal the whole time that we were there. They also put on a traditional Balinese feast the last night we were there, I have never in my life felt so special When I go back to Bali, I will be reluctant to stay anywhere else. I must admit, I did a bit of research before we left on this place and some people had written a negative review, such as rats etc, we never came across any, had a beautiful squirrel in the back yard, so I think it was a case of not knowing the difference. If you ever have the chance to stay at this beautiful place and experience what we just have, please take it, you will never regret it. So looking forward to the next time that I can stay here. Terimakasih Bali Rich Villas.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
296,Was alright. Could be better.,30,November 2012,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa at Bali Rich villas in November. They have very nice rooms and bathrooms with heaps of wardrobe space. Air con was noisy in both rooms. Great sized fridge outside, however the outdoor lounge area only has a 2 seater and a single seat for 4 adults. Also there is only 2 sun lounges which doesn’t make sense again when there is 4 people??
The breakfast in the morning was nice and they have a reasonable range on the a la cart menu. Would love to see a Cappuccino Machine.
The large pool is very uninviting as there is visible algae in most of it, so obviously that was avoided. There is also a well stocked bar here, but because no one was swimming in the poos, then no one bought any drinks.
There are 2 entries to the property with the old entry right on Jalan Kerobokan which is across the road from a mid-sized supermarket. This entry is also about 100 metres from ""Geneva Store"" heading west. Heading east, it is about 80 metres from where the Sunset Rd meets Jalan Kerobokan and the start of Jalan Oberoi. 10 minute’s walk to Seminyak Square and the nice restaurants such as Nirwana and Chandi. The main entrance is on the same road as the prison (About 1km away).
Overall, I think a few small things would really improve this place as it has a very nice feel about it and is in a pretty good location.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
297,Our Oasis in Bali,50,November 2012,"My wife purchased two Five-Night stays at the Bali Rich Villas in Seminyak and our son and his partner had a break there before the crazy university exam period began in Melbourne. They raved about the great place and wonderful service.
My wife and I booked the second stint for November(2012) and were equally impressed. The Villas are spacious and clean. Each has its own cooking facilities and beautiful pool (around 6m x 3m in size but only guessing) or you can use the resort main pool near the restaurant/bar. The breakfasts are sumptuous with an a la carte choice.
Staff here are exceptionally friendly (even by Bali's high standard) and very efficient. They are the 'jewels in the crown' with nothing ever being considered too much trouble. A few minor issues with the Wifi or hot water outage and even bugs in the pool after a storm were attended to immediately and with a big Bali smile! The Operations Manager, Suramali is very hands on and together with the cleaners/waiters/drivers make the Bali Rich Villas a great choice.
Bali was never on my bucket list to be honest, however I will be back to Bali and definitely to Bali Rich.

Hint: If you are like me and prior to booking like to Google Earth a place for location and proximity etc this one can be confusing and in fact comes up as several listings in several locations. The Villas are located between Mertanadi and Kerobokan Streets north of Sunset Rd. The villas stretches and is accessible from both.
Hint2: Don't go home without eating at Sardine in Legian (see separate review) and get there by calling Wayun (also separate review coming ) Ask Wayan for his heartwarming story, particularly relevant if you are an Aussie. (and tell him Wayne told you) Wayan's number 081 338 999 757
Hint 3: Dont pack many clothes. Buy a few things there.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
298,Great stay using scoopon voucher,40,November 2012,"I purchased a scoopon voucher to stay at bali rich for 5 nights and I was impressed by the size of the villa and by our very own private pool. The villa was a little run down (couple of cracks in wall) but it was very clean and tided very well everyday. The staff are very friendly and went out of their way to cater for your needs. I found the free shuttle service into Seminyak, Kuta and Legion easy to use and book (do need to find your own way back but they recommend which taxi service to use). Breaksfest is awesome and they are quite happy to serve it in your villa. Great place to stay if you want to shop and chill by the pool. Worth a visit to the spa as well, best massage I had in bali",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
299,Beautiful!,50,October 2012,"My partner and I recently used a 'scoopon' deal and stayed in a villa for a week. Needless to say we didn't want to leave. And we didn't for the first 2 days, $4AU room serviced cocktails, private pool, the all around service and relaxing nature of the villa was too good to waste. The rooms are quiet, private and the private pool was sensational. The staff were amazing. Catered to our every need with a warm smile. Room service prices were great. The meal options were also good as there was 2 places to eat on site, each with different menus. The breakfast menu had a good variety of meals. We were also shuttled to where ever we pleased each day.
This was our first visit to Bali and in talking with friends and family upon return, the main theme has been how awesome the room was. Would go back in a heartbeat.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
300,7 Night - Scoopon bought stay in Seminyak.,30,October 2012,"We were in villa 101, 1 bedroom deluxe, huge shower and bathroom...bath we didn't use because it didn't have any hot water. Massive closet to hang things, but only 6 hangers. Huge canopy king bed. We were the furthest away from reception.

Our villa was next to the carpark for employees (very annoying) and next to the ribs terminal (restaurant on the property). We were asked at 9am and regular intervals on our coming and going (sometimes up to 5 back and forth trips a day whew!) if we would like a cocktail or beer, which became very annoying and my partner and I had bets to what they would offer.

The doors which were in the ads to open up to the pool were locked and reception could not open them with their keys or ours. The electricity turned off with warning the day after we arrived. The 7 day stay had many many outages, one went for 12 hours (overnight, and until midday) as well as a water outage at the same time which we asked 5 times for them to fix. I might add it was about 35Degrees and 97% humidity that day.

The curtains in the villa were not thick enough. Sun shined through them and we woke up as soon as the sun started to shine. (6am)

I would add that they went above and beyond when I lost my credit card in an ATM, they drove me to each CBA one. Maybe this is because they had swiped this card when we arrived at the hotel. They only use bluebird taxis. This is GOOD. It cost $3 AUD (metered)to the bottom of Kuta in 45 mins of traffic. Other hotels use the bartering taxis which are extremely unfair. Always use BlueBird.

We booked 7 nights, we arrived at the hotel at 12.05am Saturday and were told to check out 11am the following Friday, although it had been discussed to leave later. They attempted to charge us $120 to stay another 2 hrs (1pm) and didn't seem pleased for holding our bags. We spent the rest of the afternoon spending money elsewhere because of their rudeness.

The free breakfast was kind of boring but it was ok for a few random days in bed. However, we asked for our coffee to be from bottled water... This was not the case as we both came down with horrendus Bali Belly for two days before being able to eat another meal.. One of these days I might add was when the 12 hour electricity outage happened to our villa.

The gas stove outside did not work, we found a gecko dead in-between the doors inside. Cupboards under the sink smelt like and had mould inside of them. I mentioned earlier the bath had only cold water. The TV channel had very poor signal, only few channels could be watched. As far as I could see, 2 were in English.

The SPA. Was extremely expensive. A spa outside (5 mins walk) a massage for an hour cost AUD $5 but in Bali Rich cost $25 AUD.

Last note: Do not change your currency at the hotel. Their rates are very low compared to the better rates at the proper money exchangers on the street.

I would prefer to stay elsewhere if I go back...",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
301,MICE IN VILLA! DISGRACE!!!,10,October 2012,"This place doesn't even deserve 1 out of 5! I wish I could give it a minus 5 out of 5.

We booked a room at Bali Rich Seminyak for one night at $200 US a night. (not cheap)

We woke in the middle of the night to scurrying noises around the room. My partner sat up suddenly at once point, because something had jumped on his forehead and ran across the bed. I then saw 'something' jump from the lampshade on my bedside table onto the ground and across the floor. We rang reception and they came to have a look. They couldnt find anything. We tried to go back to sleep with the lights ON as I was so sick of being woken by noises and unable to see what it was (my partner thought it was a frog). I heard another noise shortly after and I woke to see a mouse tail hanging out of the lamp shade - right near my head! . Once again we called reception to let them know there were mice in the room. As they were coming to check, I saw another big black mouse run across the room into a hole in the wall. - There was was at least two mice in the villa and they looked like seriously manky, diseased mice and they were not scared of humans - they jumped onto my partners head for christ sake!

At 3am, we said we weren't staying there - NO WAY - so they booked us into their 'sister' hotel in Kuta, which was a TINY room in a small hotel, but at least there were no mice in sight. We went back to Bali Rich Villa the next day to sort out payment and not ONLY did they refuse to refund our money for their manky, mice ridden villa, they also made us pay full rate for the night at their sister hotel, which we got transferred to. They were unreasonable and unwilling to look after us or offer us any sort of refund or payment, despite the fact we had rodents in the room and had to pack up all our stuff at 3am in the morning and catch a taxi to Kuta to stay in accommodation that was not even close to the 'standard' of a NORMAL 5 star villa.. I was also more than 5 months pregnant and found the situation quite distressing.

This was not a 5 star villa. And we were not treated as five star guests.

I hope NO ONE stays in these villas and if they do, I certainly hope they aren't treated the same way we were.

DISGRACEFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
302,Not fit to be a hotel,10,September 2012,"would not recommend to anyone. The hotel is badly maintained. the shower was not working, and there were moulds. The toilet flush was broken. The wardrobe doors were fallung apart. The worst hotel u have ever stayed.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
303,faultless,50,September 2012,"Our time at Bali Rich Luxury Villas in Seminyak was faultless. The staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was to much trouble. They all went out of there way to ensure our stay was fantastic. The villa was so spacious and clean. The pool was a decent size and was always so cool, not to hot like a lot of bali pools. Breakfast every morning was wonderful, with quite a selection to choose from. I found the villas to be in a great location, only 5 minutes walk to the great restaurants and shops of Seminyak. I would definitely stay there again next time i visit Bali. Thanks to all the staff for a fantastis holiday.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
304,Great value,40,September 2012,"The hotel is situated nicely in central Seminyak. The staff is utternost friendly and helping, the lobby is nice, too. The villas are beautiful, especially the private garden and pool. Also the bedroom is very luxurious. The bathroom is ok, however we really missed a toilet door. The cleanliness, however, is ok but not great, especially in the showers.
Breakfast is served to the private villas and pretty good, but a bit blant. So is the in room dining in general. As a rule of thumb, go with the asian stuff, you will get way better food.
Overall, especially regarding the value for many, a recommendable place!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
305,Wonderful service and beautiful villa,50,September 2012,"We have just returned from Bali Rich Villas and can't fault anything about the service and lovely breakfasts we received. The staff were very friendly and always greeted us on our return, nothing seemed to be a big ask. Prices of the food and drinks were very reasonable which made us want to laze by the back pool and drink, eat and soke up the sun. We had a three year old daughter with us and she had a ball swimming in the big pool, staff greeted her by name every day and played with her whilst I enjoyed reading my book at the pool. The hotel manager was just lovely and always smiled and asked if we had everything we needed. I think these little gestures make a big difference. Thank you Bali Rich for a fantastic stay!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
306,"We loved our stay, would stay again.",40,August 2012,"We purchased a deal from Scoopon and it was great value for money. Our 1 bedroom villa was extremely comfortable with a huge bathroom and great outdoor sitting area to enjoy our breakfast each morning. Staff were very friendly and always helpful.

The only downfall was our private pool looked a little cloudy and strong chlorine, however our friends were staying in the villa next to us and their pool was perfect. Also the wifi in our villas were extremely slow and sometimes not working at all.

Overall we loved our stay and would highly recommend Bali Rich Villas.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
307,Great Bali holiday,40,September 2012,"Bali Rich is a very nice place to stay in Bali. We stayed here for 10 nights and enjoyed the stay. The staff are amazing, very friendly, and would do anything to make your stay enjoyable. The operations manager, Sumadi, was one of the most professional and caring hotel managers I have met. Thankyou again Sumadi.
The only downside to Bali Rich is that it is a fair distance from the beach or town centre so we had to use the villas free shuttle bus nearly every day to get around.
We would stay here again if we returned to Bali.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
308,great villas and great employees,40,June 2012,"I wanted a little luxury in bail and when I found a deal for bail rich I just had to try this place is amazing your own private villa with a good size pool and bath room the staff are amazing. it’s only a 5 to 10 minute drive to kuta square although I stayed in kuta on previous trips to bali having to get a taxi or a free shuttle into kuta you can’t just walk out the front of your resort and be there its sort of secluded in a way it’s a short walk to pizza hut and a few nice restaurants and shops but other than that a walk around the area isn’t very pleasant. hearing that seminyak was known as the ""upper class area of bail"" it didn’t seem like it the resort its self is beautiful the butler service is amazing the cleaners do a great job they do need to fix up the resort pool and cafe out the back as its secluded and run down. One other thing it’s in the flight path it didn’t bother me but my partner is a pretty light sleeper and sometimes he woke up to it. It’s not as bad as pervious comments have made out but it is something to take into consideration when booking. But on a good note the staffs goes out of their way to help you we had return airport transfers but as we were staying at the hard rock next they offered to take us there save getting a taxi.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
309,Highly recommended,50,August 2012,"My 1st time to Bali, and the fantastic friendly staff at Bali rich villas enhanced my experience immensely. Friendly, warm, discreet and very sharp customer service from day 1 till day 10. Met at the airport, lovely driver, welcome drinks, flowers and fresh fruit waiting in our clean beautiful well air conditioned villa. Each day While we were out, we returned to the villa looking as if we had just arrived! Room service was great, constantly, from the meals to any other requirements, ( international ph calls, booking tours, massages, whatever , just fantastic service) nothing was too much trouble, ever. Excellent aircon throughout, wifi was faultless, tv and dvd ect great( altho, i didnt go to bali to watch telly !!)Breakfast was consistently delicious. The massages very very very good! Any questions/ queries or just general info was always available, most staff speak very good English, more importantly, they are just so nice and friendly and willing to assist. The drivers were available wherever possible, and there are free shuttles daily. Mind you... A taxi to Kuta would cost you a grand total of $3... The location was great, not smack in the middle of a tourist spot, but only a short distance from seminyak square and Kuta. Easily walking distance to both. Despite the busyness at the end of the driveway.. We seemed very sheltered from the busy sounds.. Couldn't hear the traffic at all. A great location, a great villa, and awesome staff, I do highly recommend Bali rich villas for a great balinese experience.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
310,Stunning place to stay,50,August 2012,"From when you get picked up from the airport until you get dropped back off. You experience BLISS at Bali Rich
Such kind and wonderfully staff, beautiful villas, lovely and tasty breakfast.
Fantastic location. Semiyak road around the corner as well as seminyak square. Great restuarant close by .
Great walk to kuta or a 90cent taksi(taxi)

Most favorite thing about Bali rich is that it's located in a busy area but once you step inside their grounds it's like your far far away from everything . It's piece full, the staf are amazing, stayed there August 2011, 2012 and will again 2013

Thanks again for an amazing Holliday ,
Till then take care",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
311,Hidden secret in Seminyak,50,August 2012,"Overall: wonderful, friendly obliging staff, nothing too much trouble. Lovely room, well maintained private villa garden and pool. Free brekky everyday in the restaurant or in ur room (cooked by Chef or room svc from rest.) Free massage for 2.
5mins walk to main strip running from Seminyak right thought to legion and kuta and 10mins walk to 'eat street' (Raya laksmana...)

Staff are so friendly and genuine in their care for you as a guest. Nothing is too much trouble. Everyday they checked to see what time you would like your room cleaned. If you ordered room service they called to advise they were on their way first and then called again to make sue it was ok to come and collect.

Being a private villa you hardly ever saw anyone else...everyone was in their own villas keeping to themselves. It really made you feel as though you could have been the only one staying there which was lovely.

Planes did fly over everynow and then, but to be honest I never really heard them and I didn't give them a 2nd thought.

For those wanting service by the pool, you can use the main pool which has a bar and restaurant so you can sun bake, read and sip on your favorite bevvy without leaving your chair. Alternatively if u prefer a semi nude bake in your private villa they do room service drinks CHEAP!!

We were in villa 217, 1 bedroom deluxe, huge shower and bathroom...bath we didn't use. Closet to hang things but not many clothes hangers. Huge canopy king size bed which was a very comfy sleep...doors that opened up onto the private pool, bliss every morning.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

Bravo Bali Rich Villa, Seminyak!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
313,Need some maintenance,30,July 2012,"We stay at villa 209, 2 rooms villa for 2 nights. It's good that they allow us for early check in. The villa is big and beautiful, but a bit old. There are many minor things that need to be fixed. The jacuzzi is very dirty, they need to really maintain it. Door of our room is broken can't be locked, they should check it before we check in. The shower spa is very loose, it seriously need a maintenance. The TV channel is having very poor signal, only few channel can be watched. They provide a list of breakfast for you to choose, you can choose to eat at their restaurant, sent to your villa, or cook in your villa. The food is quite good. They only offer a one way shuttle service.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
314,Beautiful Pool Villa in Nice Location with Kind Staffs,50,July 2012,"I traveled Bali alone for 4 days, and for a girl like me, traveling alone, the location, cleanliness, and the other various services were the main priorities. So I researched quite a lot before getting here, and this villa came up to my picky standards. I stayed 3 nights in deluxe 1 bedroom villa in Seminyak from 12th, July.

The staffs were so nice and kind, and if there's anything I needed, the front desk can arrange everything from daily tour program, meal, spa, late check out, etc. I used the one day tour program (the villa's providing) and the program was so wonderful. Pick up and drop off service to the airport was very useful. The amenities, kitchen, utensils, and even mosquito coil and spray are set neatly and clean, so I shouldn't have brought my things that much.

And the spa in the villa, it was amazing and also, I could get some discount. Walking no more than 30 minutes, I could get almost everywhere ; beach, center of Seminyak, other trendy it spots in Bali around. I could easily find where I wanted to go, and it was good that I could enjoy bling-bling and noisy night life in Bali.

On the contrary, the villa was very quiet, so I could take a perfect rest here. One thing, the breakfast was too salty for my taste. This time I stayed in fantastic villa in Kerobokan, but later I surely also want to stay in other Bali Rich villa (especially in Ubud) again if I get a chance. Thank you so much for making me good impression of Bali in the first visit :)",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

The street behind has good handicraft shops and Mama San - a fantastic restaurant. Shutle service everyday. Lovely spa and they came everyday to cook breakfast - food ok. It is very private, very clean and a lovely place for a peaceful holiday. I had a coupon so excellent value for money",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
317,Nice but loud.,30,May 2012,"I am amazed that all prior reviews have failed to mention anything about the flight path above Seminyak! Obviously it’s not just at this place but for the area of Seminyak. Nothing was mentioned in all the reviews prior to booking. Not sure if it is just recently occurred but the noise was about every 15 minutes, so bad that we could not hear our TV and they would be flying over our heads at all hours of the day and night, not so much from midnight- 5am or so. More noticeable at night and morning when trying to sleep or would be woken up early morning. Not sure if the thatched roofs at the villa’s had something to do with it, but was very load considering the distance from the airport.

Stayed a week at end of May in a 1 bedroom pool villa (room 203) was along the side border of the property next to empty block which had roosters waking us up in the morning also. The villa itself had 3 very large rooms, consisting of kitchen/lounge, bedroom and bathroom with 2 basins, large bath tub and walk-in shower from outside pool area. Rooms cold be a bit more cleaner did not appear to be swept or mopped daily, cable tv had limited channels and 2nd air conditioner in kitchen leaking water. Had heaps of room to store all stuff in. Outside pool area nice but jets in pool very soft. Breakfast was average with a la carte menu which we had first few times but not satisfying enough and after that skipped them to go outside down eat street which was within walking distance fav were Grocer & Grinders (Petitenget st) just around the corner from Seminyak Square, very good coffee and breakfast another was The Corner Store.

All the staff were very friendlily and nice and had room service once which was good. Shuttle bus to Kuta was useful and good to have but the main pool was uninviting and disappointing, quite green.

Location was within walking distance to eat street out the back of the Villa’s past main pool turn left and keep going until your get to the bend and turn right with mostly boutique and art/craft stores but the footpaths were shocking and dangerous with big holes down to storm water drains, uneven and crumbling paths with no obvious maintenance done for decades. The roads a very busy the worst I have ever seen and very dangerous to cross. Stay clear of any supposed “authorised” money changes especially those offering higher rates than most and off the main road and ONLY deal with banks. Unfortunately some money changes are dishonest and rip you off with their magic money tricks. Count your money 3 times and give it to your partner to count again before walking away.

The taxis can be dishonest also by taking you the long way, so ask reception where a place is that you want to go and don’t let the driver take you elsewhere. Went to Kitchen house, Ultimo restaurant very nice. They tax you for everything including when you arrive and leave the airport. I’ve been to Bali before 17 years ago and it has changed to the worst, rather go Phuket Thailand next time, far better value & enjoyment with honest people.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
318,Mrs Terri,40,May 2012,"We have just returned from Bali staying at the Bali Rich Luxury Villas in Seminyak. We were warmly welcomed with easy check-in and a welcome drink. Our Villa was lovely. It was very spacious and we had our own private pool. We travelled with another couple and we were very conveniently located next door to them. The complex is very quiet and everyone friendly.
The main pool was dissappointing. The colourful painted palm trees made us feel like we were in Las Vegas, not very Balinese.
We had to grab a cab each time we went to the beach (anything from A$2.00 to $5.00 a trip) and the walk into Seminyak took about 5-10 mins, although you need to watch where you are walking as there a some big holes along the edge of the road.
We had a great trip.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
319,Great villas not so great position,40,May 2012,"We recently stayed at Bali rich villas.
Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by staff with easy check in and welcome drinks .
we were shown our villa and i was quietly pleased the villa was excellently layed out and spotlesly clean as was the pool.
once settled we decided to explore the grounds a bit more and all i could say is that it was spotless.
As we went to have a drink at the ""Ribs Terminal"" were offered complimentary afternoon tea i would have to say was a bit of a turn off as the pool area was dirty and the pool itself was green .
I dont know if this is part of the villas but i can see why people judge the whole comples on this one area it was quiet horrible.
but that said the staff were friendly and the food was ok.
Room service menu at the villas was qiet average and although you could eat in, one night would be enough as then the menu is boaring .
if you walk thru the RIBs Terminal onto the main street just to the left you will find a money changer and just over the road is a mini mart for supplies of snack food for around the pool.
The only thing i would say is that i found it very hard to walk any where as to walk into the seminyak food area you had to cross a main highway and i found this very dangerous and would not recomend this if you we elderly or did not feel confident crossing roads in bali.
But the villas do have a free shuttle bus to take you into town its just i like to walk and found this a hassle.
All in all i would have to say that my stay at Bali Rich Vilas was Not for me as it was just too hard to cross the Road especially at peak time and as i said i love to walk early morning and it was just too far away from the beach for me, but the rooms and complex were very clean and the rooms spaceous and staff more than helpful.
If you just want to escape from the world and see no one then it would be great",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
320,Bali Rich Ubud,50,April 2012,"5 days at Bali Rich Ubud up in the mountains. Staff wonderful, massage best ever. Dining overlooking the valleys the views absolutly amazing. The villa was spacious and spotless and every need taken care of. The whole place so peaceful, perfect for relaxation. Loved foods in Ubud Village and shuttle bus drivers fantastic. Would definitly go back on next visit to Bali.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
321,Beautiful rooms with lots of space and very friendly helpful staff.,50,April 2012,"My partner and I stayed in the Bali Rich Villas for three nights in April. We arrived at the villas at about 7pm on the first night. The staff greeted us with a smile and gave us some freshly made juice which was lovely, they ensured the check in procedure was very quick and hassle free.

An employee helped with our bags, took us to our Villa and gave us a quick tour. The private pool and courtyard was very relaxing and quiet. The bathroom is huge and very well presented. The king size bed very comfortable.

We had breakfast at the villas every morning, you have a choice of two chefs coming to your villa and cooking it for you or you can eat at the restaraunt.

The villas are situated close to everything, a short taxi ride to seminyak square and some of the best restaraunts in seminyak. About a 15 minute taxi ride to Kuta.

All in all we had a great stay, the staff were very helpful and I would recommend the Bali Rich Luxury Villas to anyone.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
322,Fantastic large villa we loved the private pool and enormous bathroom .Very friendly helpful staff.,40,March 2012,"We were really surprised by the size of the villa,the room was huge and the bathroom had a huge bath and a great shower that has a door you can open to enjoy the pool view. Breakfast was delivered to our villa each morning and was great. We were able to walk everywhere including the beach from our villa. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay very relaxing.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
323,Seminyak Style,40,March 2012,"Just had 5 days at Bali Rich, a compound of villas in Seminyak. Staff were welcoming and the villa was spacious, well aircon'd and clean. A problem proved to be the electricals going out quite a bit which meant no fridge / lights in certain sections and calling maintenance quite a bit - the service offered was very good but the property fit out probably let the staff down with power points hanging out of walls etc. Budi on reception was particularly helpful with shopping tips and assistance. I would rate the restaurant average - some meals lovely and some left a little to be desired. Overall a reasonable property with lovely staff.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
324,A nice place,40,March 2012,"The villas are very nice, fabulous large pool and nice outside lounge area. The bathroom is extremly spacious with a seperate large shower and jacuzzi spa bath, the bed and bathroom share a large 2 way closet which was nice, the king size bed was very comfortable. My only negative point with the villa was that the spa bath needed to be cleaned, which they did straight away when we first walked in. The other fact was when we went to take a spa bath, the water that came out of the faucets was rank which put us off having one. The food from room service was nice and resonably price.
The location of the villas was decent not too far from the main strip in seminyak, it was a nice there to the restaurants.

The shuttle service supplied by the villas was good, although they didn't start until 12 noon, but that worked for us.

All in all this was a nice place to spend our week in Seminyak",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
325,Poor quality villas,10,March 2012,"My partner and I stayed at these villas in March 2012 and were so unhappy we decided to forfeit our last few nights of accommodation to stay elsewhere when we could not get a refund. The area is not the best- on the same road as the gaol. The villas are of poor quality, and leak when its raining. We came home one night to find our villa completely flooded.
The villas are quite spacious but the air conditioning is not effective in the big rooms at all, and the breakfasts were very disappointing. The only positive is that the staff were friendly.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
326,Disappointing,30,March 2012,"I have always picked a villa in Seminyak by its reviews and have never been disappointed. This was my fourth visit to Bali and my first 'average' accommodation experience. I got a sense of it from the tacky lobby decor and the staff who checked us in, who kept demanding our credit card as soon as we arrived! Despite having booked two months in advance and aware that we were three women travelling alone, we were not given adjoining villas. Although the rooms and the villa gardens were very spacious, they lacked the quality and elegance that makes it a 'special' place. The air- conditioning was inadequate as the rooms were probably too large and we had to call and request for a pedestal fan at 1am! The toiletries were cheap and there were tiny lizards that dropped from above on several occasions which completely freaked me out!
The villa pool looked murky and uninviting and we thought it best not to use it. The breakfast was a complete let down as was the service. I was told that the villas had had a complete makeover recently- hogwash! For the price- there are better options in Seminyak.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
327,Girls birthday trip,40,February 2012,"I was shocked to read the last 3 reviews on Bali Rich Villas. In February for 8 days (5 days on deals voucher and then an extra 3 days at the web page prices) I stayed at the Bali Rich Villas. I thought the service was excellent.The food at breakfast was good and the times I couldn't be bothered eating at one of the restaurant/cafe's in Seminyak with my friends, I ordered room service and the food was yummy. The villa that I stayed in was cleaned/neaten up every day and the second day I was at the villas, the reception staff gave me an umbrella to use the rest of my stay as we did have some rainy weaither while staying in and the house keeping staff would leave a towel at one of the entrance inside my villa, so I could wipe my feet on it before waking into the villa. I was happy with the standard of cleaning. I found the staff friendly, but they need to brushup on their english, as I felt some times they didn't understand me, but in saying that I gave them a 4 hours notice to make me a birthday cake, and the cake was delivered to my villa an hour earlier than they had organised with me, so the staff totally understood my request. I was over the moon when I opended the cake box to see a piece of artwork that I would be suprising my friend with, at the restaurant where the 8 of us were celebrating her birthday. When I go back to Bali in a couple of years time, I'll stay at the Bali Rich Villas again.. I didn't think my villa was old, the only issue I had wasthat the gecko's kept me up the first night I was there, with the noise they were making, but then I worked out if I left a couple of lights on, they wouldn't make any noise at all. I couldn't believe how close of I was to a main intersection, but it was so quiet in my villa, showers were working fine (like having a shower at home), no broken tiles and the only thing I noticed that around the basin's in the bathroom and around the kitchen sink there where water stains marks but I wasn't fussed about that. I was happy that there was a small insect zapper in the bedroom , mosquito coils and hug can of insect spray, things I wasn't expecting to find in my villa. Overall I was happy with my stay, even if they were small faults that have now come to my mind after typing this review, but they wouldn't stop me from staying at the villas again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
328,Terrible!,10,January 2012,"Most awful place I have ever been!!!!!Bad service!Dirty,old rooms!Broken shower.No internet!Photos on website are different from reality..I booked and paid for 11nights, had to move to another hotel in 2 days..NEVER got my money back for 9 nights ..",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
329,Beautifull Villa,50,February 2012,"Recently stayed 6 nights at Bali Rich Villas - Mertanadi St. 5 night package from Deals.com and paid extra night to Bali Rich. This was our first holiday staying in villas and I think we would struggle to go back to a normal hotel room now!
Checkin smooth and put in a 2 bed/bath villa as 1 bed were full. Room 209 - just back from restaurant & reception.
We had previously stayed at Nusa Dua Retreat for 4 nights (reviewed on TA) and although we thoroughly enjoyed it there, this was more to our style of holiday. We loved the fact that everything was on one level - walk out of room to open air kitchen/dining/lounge and yard with lawn, timber decked area for sunbeds/umbrella and of course the pool! Water cooler dispenser and large fridge which once we turned it up, worked extremely well. We were able to fit a big bag of ice in the freezer for drinks too.

Good size bedroom with large amount of wardrobe/storage - acts as the wall between bedroom and bathroom so can access from both sides. Bed/pillows reasonably comfortable - although the bed is quite high - felt like I was climbing onto it!

Bathroom is massive AND has an airconditioner in it - a huge bonus!Large jacuzzi/spa with small TV built in at one end. Large walk in shower with multi jet system. Shower had door to outside so if you were in the pool and didnt want to walk through the bedroom to go to bathroom, you could walk through shower to bathroom.

Pool had a few broken tiles on the steps. There was a ledge along the ""steps"" end of pool so that if you wanted to sit in the water and read, you could. Pool had graduated depth - so no problem standing.

Breakfast - the usual options of western/asian and although it was nice/hot etc, could get boring after a few days. The banana ""juice"" - really a banana smoothie was a beautiful way to start the day - just make sure you ask for ice otherwise not super cold.

Lunch - had lunch in restuarant one day - Nasi Goreng/Mee Goreng, really nice and reasonably priced as well.

Didnt eat Dinner here. There was a specials board showing the ""daily"" special as Orange Steak with ...... This was the daily special for all of the 6 days - maybe was green steak by the time we left?? haha!
There was a small bar area at the restaurant, however only 1 occasion we saw someone there.

Included in our package was a 1 hour massage each - this was lovely and nice surroundings, however could get same or better at outside spa for pretty much half the price.

Location - well..... it IS close to Seminyak but is actually Kerobokan. It is only a 10 minute walk to Eat St or a 2/3 minute taxi ride. The local shopping is limited - are a few ""local"" shops to buy coke/water etc (not Circle K or similar) and predominately furniture/lighting/homeware type wholesale shops. If you walk through the back of the villas to main road, Raya Kerobokan (I think), there is a Mandiri Bank/ATM's and a proper money changer with excellent exchange rates in a safe environment. Although Bali Rich is close to a large intersection, once you are inside, you do not hear any road noise. Is an unscheduled shuttle service - just ask at reception and only need to tip driver.

At the Mertanadi St entrance, there is a small local dressmaker. I bought some sarongs in Legian that were too long and was able to have these taken up for minimal cost. Staff dont speak much english so if you want anything altered, ask staff to ring the ""boss"" and you can explain to her.

We just loved Bali Rich Villas and would definitely stay here again.

Pros - size of villa/all one level. Close to Seminyak. Friendly staff.
Cons - broken tiles in pool, minimal shopping, slippery floor tiles (staff leave a few bath mats around for you though) did have to ask staff to give the toilet a thorough clean - was quite brown up near the rim (otherwise was excellent)",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
330,Bali Professionals,30,February 2012,"Just got back from our 4th trip to Bali with several friends, had a great time again except for the negative experience with Bali Professionals, mainly due to their excessive margins on the villas we rented, Bali Rich and Villa Kim. Furthermore, they had not provided us with the villa we had booked. The worse thiing however, is they have not responded to our feedback and questions. Feel free to contact me directly for more information.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

333,A little piece of Bali to reduce the autumn chill,40,May 2011,"A perfect way to get away from the cooler season in Australia - the humidity and warmth of Bali.

This place became our home away from home. The villa style accommodation was perfect for privacy. Especially as the villa came with its own pool - a necessity in Bali.

The local food served for room service was great. The complimentary breakfast was good, but I recommend you seek out some other alternatives for a great coffee.

All the staff were helpful and there is a free shuttle bus regularly available.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
334,A totally relaxing stay at a Lovely Villa~~,40,November 2011,"Had called for transport to transfer from my hotel at Kuta to the villa just a day ago before my stay at Bali Rich. Staff were very accomodating and had arrange it for us. The villa were lovely and we simply enjoyed our stay over there. Do try the food room service, we found the food very tasty and i think it is from different restaurants as compared to the breakfast which doesn't really taste yummy. Only hiccup was that we have booked a free shuttle service provided by the villa to Seminyak but when we were there, they just told us their boss has use the car and there is no driver for the day and advice us to take a cab or walk there instead. I like the privacy of the villa and the pool is really lovely.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
335,"The perfect way to de-stress, relax & thoroughly enjoy!",50,October 2011,"The second I walked out of Customs @ Bali Airport and saw 'Made the Driver"" with a sign with my name - standing right at the front of the large crowd so I couldn't miss him - I knew that Bali Rich Luxury Villa's 'had it together'!!
The lovely Girls on Reception had me checked in, with a cold drink, and the Porter to get me to my room after the long flights, speedily.
And what a wonderful surprise the room was. Spacious, with separate Lounge/dining/kitchen, an enormous bedroom (KS bed), and a huge bathroom with a door leading out of the shower to the sparkling swimming pool!!
The ice for my Gin & Tonic arrived within minutes via a smiling room-service Girl, and I knew that I was truly in paradise as I sat on one of the 2 lollabouts by the pool.

When I travel, I usually travel with friends, not as a couple! Hence, I would like there to be some Villa's with TWIN-BEDS. As it was, the KS bed sufficed for the 5 nights. However, it is important for the large amount of friends/buddies/mates that travel to Bali together that they actually can enjoy a good nights sleep in their own bed. I am hoping Bali Rich Luxury Villa's can accommodate us in the future with these twin-beds.

SPECIAL MENTION to Budi on the front desk; perfect English, professional in the extreme, and could answer all queries in a flash!! Likewise Made, an excellent and capable Driver.

I thoroughly recommend Bali Rich Villa's - at the end of a long shopping/sight-seeing day, it is the perfect relaxing and very peaceful destination to return to.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
336,Perfect Honeymoon Getaway...,50,February 2011,"We took a honeymoon package in bali rich villa, and it was the best holiday in our life. The private villa was just amazing, the room was spacious and cozy, as well as the bathroom with roses decorated bath tub and, and a large shower area. We just loved the large private pool, and we would jump into the pool everyday to refresh after the tour. The rooms are really quiet and romantic. Their staffs were very friendly and helpfull. The food provided was also fresh and tasty. We also enjoyed the spa which was excellent and relaxing. On the whole, bali rich villa made our honeymoon the most romantic and memorable vacation.....",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
337,Private relaxation!,50,October 2011,"My partner and I chose Bali Rich Villas as we wanted somewhere private and relaxing but also wanted to be close to the array of shops and restaurants in Seminyak. Bali Rich was exactly that! The staff were friendly from the moment we got to the airport and they were very accommodating whenever we needed anything. Our villa was lovely and spacious with an amazing bathroom and authentic thatched roof. The private pool and sun deck were exactly what we were looking for and made staying in the room much more enjoyable than staying in a hotel. I would definitely recommend Bali Rich Villas to couples who want to stay somewhere quieter than a hotel, but who still want to be close enough to enjoy all Seminyak has to offer.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
338,Very Dissapointing!!!,20,July 2011,"After coming straight from another villa which was faultless & amazing this just didn't compare. Right from the word go everything was not good, unfriendly welcome & the person who showed us the villa spoke poor english.
The 2 bdrm villa we stayed in was very shabby & rundown, the plants around the pool were dead. The lounges were stained & had cigarette burns. The lock on the front gate was broken, the jets on the shower were blocked. There was no main pool as advertised on the net just a very derelict sad area where one had been. It was such an overpriced mistake booking this.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
339,A perfect place to stay.......,50,October 2011,"We arrived at the Villas lt 11 o'clock at night tired and hot. We were greeted with a smile and taken straight to our three bedroom villa. It was lit up beautiful and spotlessly clean. The rooms were large and the bathroom are amazing with a large bath, dual sinks and a huge shower. The rooms and pools are cleaned daily and all staff were always smiling and respectful of your privacy. The breakfast is simple but in my opinion enough options fot you to try something different most days. Breakafast consists of indonesian, american or english all served with fruit juice and coffee.

We stayed at the villas for 5 nights in a three bedroom villa with 5 friends in total and could not fault it at all. I will be definately be staying there again and cant wait to take my family this time.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
340,romantic hideaway,50,November 2010,"Myself and my partner want to bali last year for three weeks, for the first week we stayed in a the bali rich private villa's, they were amazing. The villa itself was stunning and a perfect hideaway but in the centre of all the action if thats what you are looking for. Everything you could want was encorporated into the villa's, luxury, privacy, romance and excelent food and service! We will one day go back as this was the most memorable holiday i ever had and the bali rich was a massive part of that. The only thing that bothered me was the nightly power cut (not really the villa's fault) but i must say as our bedroom just had glass walls it was a little un nerving at night.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
341,Bliss at Bali Rich,50,October 2011,"We have just stayed 7 wonderful nights at the luxury Bali Rich Villas in Seminyak.

The private pool was just perfect and the king size bed was bliss, the villa was quiet and romantic! The staff were so helpful and always with a smile, whether it was delivering an ice bucket for our champagne or for my new love of their chicken Quesadillas.

The Villas are only 5 minutes away from the world class/gourmet restaurants in Seminyak such as Metis … so with great food, fantastic accommodation our holidays was fabulous. It is our 4th time at the villas and we will be back again soon, we just love it.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
342,Loved it!,50,September 2011,"This place was magic, brilliant service, huge rooms and large private pool. We will be back next year for sure. If you're looking for a nice big sunny villa with a huge pool then this is the place to stay....",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
343,Bali Luxury at its Best!,40,November 2010,"Stayed 3 nights at the Bali rich villas in Sanur and had a lovely holiday. We wanted to stay away from the tourist area of Kuta so we opted for Sanur and it was great!

The villas were beautiful and very clean and well maintained. Staff come into your villa and cook your breakfast in your kitchen. They were really lovely and went well out of their way to make the stay enjoyable. The private pool was such a nice touch as well. Very affordable for the absolute luxury that you get. Would recommend to everyone!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
344,"Old, run down, too expensive.",20,June 2011,"After reading the reviews for this property we booked it at $250 AUS at night. We left before our due departure date and escaped up the coast to newer and better value accommodation. Location is ok but the villa we had was poorly maintained. Doors didn't lock, garden was unkempt, rundown and tired. Don't stay there unless you get a room for $75 a night",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
345,"Not so ""rich"" bali Rich Villas",20,July 2011,"Very disappointing
The villa itself was ok, though rather tired
BUT
a large communal pool and restaurant and bar area was closed and we were not told in advance!
The food from the only restaurant open was ordinary in the extreme
Also, its not as close to the beach as they suggest.
We would not recommend it",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
346,Not the best villas we have been in Bali,30,June 2011,"We have been in Bali ( seminyak) many times, each time we go to a different Villa,
this time we were a bit disappointed, For 200 Usd per night in Bali you can get much more than this. The Villas are old ( even if they have been just refurbish) the space inside the Villa is odd having a huge room with a bed in the middle and little more, the garden with the pool is not bad but they need to work on the vegetation as it looks really poor, some how it doesn't inspire to be outside on the garden or by the pool.
We were disappointed also with the breakfast which seems to be really poor, served in the villa, it will arrive always cold ( my toast) and the pastry wouldn't be anything special.
In my opinion, this place would be fine if it costed less. We also had to change villas cos the toilets didn't flush properly, problem that it seems to happen in all the Villas.
But to be said in the last years prices have gone significantly up in Bali, but the quality hasn't accompanied the increase.
So overall not a bad place, but if you know Seminyak there are other villas where you can get more value for you money.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
347,Just Loved Bali Rich Villas,50,June 2011,"After many weeks of extensive research on the internet my daughter and I decided on Bali Rich Villas for our 10 day holiday and are so glad we did! Our villa was absolutely luxurious with everything you could possibly wish for. The extremely efficient staff catered to our every need making our stay so enjoyable. Bali Rich is in close proximity to the beach, shops and restaurants. It is set back from the street which makes is so quiet and peaceful. There is a wide variety of foods to choose from for breakfast - all absolutely delicious! We can hardly wait for our next Bali holiday and will definitely be staying at Bali Rich Villas. We highly recommend it!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
348,"Perfect, private villas!",50,June 2011,"The perfect start to our holiday! Beautiful, large, private villas with private pool & sunny backyard! Just off the main roads (so much quieter!) but still just a $2 taxi fare to everywhere!! Brilliant service, super friendly staff, the grounds/rooms were immaculate & clean. We stayed in a deluxe villa & it was just massive! Add in the little things (eg breakfast bought to your room, free wifi) which made it that much better. Also can recommend their in-house spa!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
349,Pretty good for the price but where's the pool?,40,May 2011,"We booked a one bedroom villa through wotif that included breakfast, transfers and a free massage. Overall it was pretty good value and we would consider staying again.

The villa and outside area is exactly as pictured- big open bedroom, kitchen and small lounge area on one side and big bathroom with 2 person spa bath on the other. Outside area is quite big too and has a pool, grassed area and small wooden deck with two sun lounges and an umbrella (which needed a clean/replacement). We liked the layout and design- especially the wardrobes which open both on the bedroom side and the bathroom side. The kitchen was quite big but oddly arranged (fridge was facing away from the kitchen, in the middle of the room).

Generally the villa is very quiet and you can't hear any neighbors. There are a couple of noisy roosters in the area and they crowed from early in the morning. There's also a temple of some kind a few doors down and occasionally you can hear music playing from there. This was quite annoying one morning when it woke us at 6.30am. The spa was directly opposite our villa (#208) but we never heard any noise coming from it. In fact, going past it every day, we never saw any guests using it either.

At the beginning of our stay we could just ask for a driver to take us somewhere (eg. A restaurant or a shopping area nearby) and it was never a problem. As more people checked in though, there were often no cars in the parking area and we were left to flag down our own taxi in the street outside (which isn't always easy). Even if they don't offer, make sure you ask the staff to order you a taxi.

The main entrance (on jalan merta nadi) is in a pretty crappy area. Lots of random dogs are out at night and it's not very well lit. There are lots of holes in the pavement so be careful walking at night. Although the hotel advertises itself as being in Seminyak, all the taxi drivers referred to it as being in Kerobokan. It's not a bad area to be in but I wouldn't say it's in the centre of everything. It's about a 10 minute walk down to the start of the Seminyak shops. There's a supermarket on the first main intersection near the hotel which we used a lot. To get to Seminyak square/Eat Street, we generally took a taxi or walked (15-20 mins). The hotel isn't near the beach at all, if that's what you're looking for.

The breakfast is a la carte rather than buffet and it is fairly basic, with not many choices, particularly if you are a vegetarian. There's a choice of Asian or American dishes and they'll also bring you a plate of fresh fruit to start with. The main waiter there was a stand out for his customer service. We went to the restaurant for dessert one night and they didn't have many of the dishes available. We both ordered waffles in the end but were given pancakes (not sure if waffles=pancakes in Bali?).

The spa is pretty basic and there aren't many treatments on offer. I got a manicure while my boyfriend had the free massage (which he described as 'intense'- prepare yourself for toe cracking). While the manicurist was good, there were very few polishes to choose from and they were poor quality brands. If you want a manicure, I suggest you bring your own polish.

The staff are very polite and helpful. They don't have a huge amount of English but that wasn't really a problem. Housekeeping did a very good job and never once came at a time that we were there.

We arranged for a driver to take us on a one day tour for 600,000. I thought it would be worth the expense rather than going with a tour company that would just take us to typical, overpriced tourist things and shops where they get a kick back. We started the day following itinerary #2 but quickly found the activities to be too touristy. Our driver was fine with us changing the itinerary entirely and didn't push unwanted activities on to us.

Suggestions for improvement: the restaurant could have a better menu, more options for breakfast, more information provided in the folder in the villa (there's hardly any info in there, just brochures for the hotel- would be useful to have shuttle times, Internet instructions, nearby services, restaurants etc), better internet (soooo slow!). Also wotif advertised that there would be afternoon tea available but there was nothing of the sort. As mentioned by others, breakfast can be brought to your room but they don't cook it there for you.

Oh and about the pool? Where is it?? It's pictured on their website and in their brochures but there's actually no main pool at the hotel.

Overall, while there were some drawbacks, it was a nice villa for the price we paid. I would recommend it to those looking for an affordable, private villa, a bit away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta/Legian/Seminyak.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
350,Beautiful Staff,40,March 2011,"We stayed at Bali Rich for 8 nights in March, 2011. I booked directly with them and got a very good rate. When we first arrived they took us to a room I wasnt happy with. The room was lovely but the pool had a huge drop directly on to concrete and no grass. I voiced my concerns to the staff who immediately said we will fix it. They returned in about 5 minutes and moved us to the 2 bedroom villa opposite reception. Awesome.

Room was lovely, very convenient right at the front on the villas and hardly any noise. Couldnt ask for much more. Staff didnt even charge us for late checkout on the final night. We didnt leave till about 7.30pm. We were happy to pay but they said dont worry about it.

Food was ok. Breakfast was ok, just ok. Was cold most days. I really think Bali Rich could improve on food in a big way. The coffee is horrible. Juice was so sweet I couldnt drink it. Room service which we only had once I think but would have had more if it was nicer. We got takeout most nights and their driver would drive us down to get it. Overall wasnt impressed with the food.

Location was ok. Doesnt take long by taxi down to Legian or Eat Street and very cheap taxis. Most times if the driver was available they would drive us anyway. I would have liked to just walk out the door and be able to get something to eat etc but in saying that is wasnt the worst location. The traffic from both entrances is very busy but we got quite skilled at crossing the roads etc.

So overall lovely rooms and pool. Service was amazing and always so friendly. Very good value for money I thought. Food could be improved.

I would definately stay at Bali Rich again.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
351,"Nice hotel, good service, no complaint from me at all",40,March 2011,"The owner of this villa is from Singapore. We got the room at around RM 568 per night from agoda.com. The theme of this villa combines the modern and Balinese style. This villa is suitable for honeymoon. they only have about total of 10 units villa in Semiyak Bali Rich. They have 3 MPV free 1 way shutter service to kuta, Angung Bali, Airport, Seminyak city etc .

P/S - Small tips : once you are in the car, treat the driver nice a bit. You’ll get free 2 way trip instead of 1 :). I got mine to Angung Bali and a stop by shopping before to airport

First Impression:
The road entrance from the main road to the hotel lobby really didn’t impress me. It’s like entering the Chow Kiat road street. The lobby looks like a 3 or 4 star hotel, very small and not much decoration.

Reception :
The stuff is friendly and helpful. They greet us with the welcome drink (Orange cocktail) once we arrived. The people there will only say Yes and yes and yes. Great service

Getting Into The Room :
From the reception to the villa, you might need to walk a little. I got my leg hurt before reaching the Villa and it was raining : ( So my Mr.B will have to carry me while the stuff help us to carry our bags.

The Exterior And Environment Of The Suite:
The Villas is actually very near to each other. Each row will have 2 villas. From 1 row to another is around 10 - 15 steps away, but even the villas is near you can hardly hear what’s going on next door. So Yeap it’s totally ‘PRIVATE’

The Room:
The Room is big. We have our own private pool from 4 feet to 6 feet. Fully equip kitchen, living hall, working desk, flat screen TV and DVD player, safe , double seat Jacuzzi with DVD player and TV attach, semi outdoor shower, private sundeck, 24 hour room service, no extra charges for delivery to hotel, daily free fruits, cold and hot water dispenser, bottle drinks , robe and slipper.

The Service After We log In The Complaint:
No complaint at all for this trip. Herm… Just realize that this is the only hotel that we have no complaints.

Hotel Maintenance:
Everything is well maintained.

Security /Safe in the hotel :
They have their own safe in room. Each and every door will have their own key.

Food :
The Tom Yam is the only dish I had in the villa, as outside of the villa will have more choice and variety. The Tom Yam is not sour enough, so we added some lime into it. Overall not too bad.

The Tour:
The free shutter service is good. Just call to the reception before you want to go out. Pre book is always good. Ask the reception for the nearest attraction place to visit and shop and the shutter car will bring you there.

Night Life:
Semiyak is a very nice and relaxing place so if you are looking for nightlife, drinking and fine dining, take the free shutter to Kuta or legian.

FOC attraction / what you can do :
Free shutter to anywhere you like near seminyak. Free high speed wifi

A must Item in Bali Rich Villa :
Sunblock

352,Amazing experience - perfect honeymoon,40,February 2011,"Started our honeymoon in Bali with Bali rich villas as the first destination for total of 3 days and we need to appreciate the efforts, hospitality of the staff to make our stay an unforgettable experience. Right from airport transfers to our final check out on day four everything seemed to be just perfect. Location is good right in the heart of seminyak and they have free shuttle transfers to seminyak and kuta.
About the room, it was perfect, having a private pool with a water spout and small pool deck to enjoy. Privacy is never an issue throughout the villa. The bathroom is lavish with a nice large stone bathtub placed in a pebbled patch. Another smart thing was that the walk in wardrobe was designed as a partition so that it is accessible from both bedroom and bath area. Cleanliness was never an issue throughout our one bedroom villa which was 203. Bed design was a balinese four poster. Kitchenette and the small living was a perfect space to experiment our few cooking skills.
But the best memories that we took back from Bali rich villas is their hospitality which was wonderful and unmatched. The staff was courteous, polite and always there to help us in selecting and specially preparing veg meals for us. Must mention the breakfast was lovely and the fruits tasted yummy.
In all great place to stay for short periods, one should definitely consider this one.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
353,The perfect villas and service to make our honeymoon special!,40,March 2011,"Staff are so friendly, eager to please and out to make your stay a special one.

Location was great, far enough away to avoid the crowds and with the option of 2 different street entrances, easy enough to access Seminyak on foot.

Option to have breakfast delivered to ur villa or to eat in the restaurant is a nice mix. They don't actually cook it in your villa as stated on Wotif/last minute.com

This is my 5th time to Bali and I will definitely return to Bali Rich Villas.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
354,amazing,50,February 2011,"wow! bali rich villas-i would live there. this was the highlight of our holiday for our recent 10 night stay in bali. we stayed for 3 amazing nights. we were greated at the airport and given cool towels, water and most importantly air con. we then arrived an had to wait for 15 minutes while they finished preparing our room (as we arrived at 830am and had confirmed it would be ok to check in at this time) we had the very first villa opposite the lobby/restaraunt area and were a little concerned about the noise-yet didnt hear a thing. we were given the 2 bedroom villa with a massive king size bed, private pool, large walk thru wardrobes, massive bathroom inc semi outdoor shower (there are 3 different shower heads) and to our suprise a large spa with dvd/flashing lights. the power went out on the second day but a back up generator quickly took over. breakfast was delivered at our nominated time and was nice and filling. i would deffinatly stay here again. seminyak itself doesnt have alot of tourist attractions (deffinatly the area to go if you want to get our of the busy tourist areas) the villas are about 15 mins from kuta but there are shuttles which go into kuta a few times a day or a taxi is about 25000rph. there are also to entries to the villa complex we were dropped at the opposite one after dinner and it took about 10 mins to walk back to our room.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
355,Amazing service!!,50,December 2010,"The location is fantastic, easy access to all area, free shuttle from to Kuta beach is more advantages.
Staff was very friendly, with good food at the restaurant. TOM YAM SOUP was superrbbbb!!! Could not find anywhere else!
Although some missing small details with the villa, all waived by their good service!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
356,Nice,40,November 2010,"Im verry happy stay there, they are so friendly staff",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
357,"A hidden gem! Gorgeous villas, a little further out..",40,November 2010,"My boyfriend and I arrived to be greeted by very friendly staff, and a refreshing cold drink. Our villa was very close to reception which was handy, considering all the walking we had done sight seeing. As soon as we were escorted into our very own villa, we were amazed it was gorgeous. We decided to explore, and noticed that there were areas that needed improvement. The place was very new, things needed maintenance already. The shower was modern, but some of the handles were broken, and it almost looked old! Immediately we were calling reception as the internet connection was failing and we could not find soap for the shower, which was labelled as shampoo. The staff where more than happy to tend to us, and were very polite. On arrival, we had also organised for our breakfast to be cooked in the kitchen in our villa. We filled out the order, but the following morning, nobody showed up. We called reception, re-ordered, and ibreakfast was brought into our room already made. The place was gorgeous, but I think they just need to work on their organisation, and pay more attention to detail. We booked the one room villa, and were upgraded to the two bedroom villa, which had the outdoor kitchen. It was very spacious, with a massive bathroom with a jacuzzi. It was our honeymoon, so they filled our jacuzzi with flowers, which made it that little bit more special.
To get to Kuta, we would jump onto the shuttle which went out to most of the tourist areas several times a day. Each time we went we didnt have to wait, and it was just us in the shuttle, which was nice! To catch a cab into Kuta, it costed only a few Australian Dollars, $3 at most!
Having our own pool was wonderful, and it was quiet, so it was a wonderful place to relax, if you don't want to be in amongst the action!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
358,Room for improvement,30,October 2010,"We stayed in the one bedroom villa. It was new and spacious and very quiet and relaxing. However with construction going on at the villa next door to us there was lots of crashing and even jackhammering so loud that while we were in the bath it vibrated! We did move villas and they were very accommodating of this. The attention to detail was lacking - the doors were difficult to lock and the shower was not very good at all. The wifi didn't work and on one day there was no running water for an hour. We booked thru wotif and it said there would be afternoon tea and breakfast cooked in your villa, however there was no afternoon tea and brekky delivered via room service rather than cooked. The food, although very cheap, was of poor quality.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
359,"Not too bad, not fantastic either",40,October 2010,"i booked this villa 5 months ago @ US$130 per night for the one bedroom villa, and before arrival I have read about negative reviews regarding the old villa, so I requested for new villa and jacuzzi bathtub. Was given a 2-bedroom villa initially with one room locked, but it was situated right behind the reception and restaurant, we changed to a one bedroom villa #203 without jacuzzi.

First impression is the airy and sunshine feel which we love, and it was a min walk away from reception which we preferred for the serenity and quietness. The dining area and bedroom are air-conditioned, which I personally like as all previous villa i stayed have open concept living area, including the 2-bedroom villa we were initially offered.

Bedroom is spacious, bathroom have 2 sinks, a bath tub and shower. One thing that bothers me a little is that the toilet bowl is only 50 cm away from the bathtub with no partition at all, so imagine if you were soaking in the tub and your partner is having big business! *haha* The shower is between the sink and has a door leading out toward the pool which i love! But there are no door between the shower room and sink/toilet bowl/bathtub.

Upon staying, we found ants on the pavement and dead caterpillar in the pool! There are also small bugs flying here and there! I guess it is the norm just that i came from the city and was kinda bothered by the sight everytime i stayed in villa. The more expensive villa and reputable hotels in bali seems not to have such problems. So it's a give and take senario

Breakfast, not much variety, ordered omelette every morning, not too filling but the taste is good. Green curry is nice too, but remember not to order pork, take chicken instead! The pork is hard and tough! *my poor gum and teeth* They also never clear the plates till the next day. No turn down service too

The water is very hot from the sink and cold water runs very slowly, it seems like there is a tank of hot water and when it runs out while filling the bathtub, the water are cold after 1/3 of tub filled. but it is a really big tub, enough to fit 2.

Pool is adequate size to swim and i love standing below the waterfall as it hit hard and massage my aching shoulder! Temperature is nice also as it get sunshine the whole day! Sun tanning is perfect too!

Shuttle service not very impressive, most of the time i have to get a cab out as there are no shuttle available, probably they should have more cars instead,

But i do like the money exchange service, the rate are comparable to money exchange, but they only have SG$100 to change, probably for emergency.

The staff knows basic english but still at times it can be hard to communicate, esp the female receptionist, the male one is good.

In conclusion, the villa is value for $$$, new and clean *except bugs which are inevitable*, nice thai food *green curry chicken only* nice breakfast but not much portion, nice pool and sunshine, poor shuttle service, basic amenities only, dirty sunbed * but covered with towel is ok*",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
360,Great Villa Hotel with Superb Food and Service,50,October 2010,"The Bali Rich Villa Hotel is located in Seminyak, an upscale area of Bali. The villas were beautiful, spacious, clean and well maintained. Each has a tall privacy wall, a private pool, very large covered patio for lounging and dining, superb bedrooms and large bathrooms. The public walkways are lined with beautiful flowering plants and set the initial impression for a very enjoyable stay. The staff is friendly, sincerely interested in their customers and efficient. The food, especially the breakfasts, was uniformly delicious! (Try the French Toast and local Balinese coffee!) The only two drawbacks to the hotel were that you need a taxi to get to restaurants and nightlife or shopping, but the rides are only about 5-10 minutes. The other issue was the crow of roosters from a neighboring property starting early in the morning. Still, for the great value received, I found these two drawbacks to be very minor.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
361,"Elegant, Spacious and good Value",40,September 2010,"We arrived in the evening and were shown to our 2 person private villa which was quite a walk from reception; everything seemed fine but we were woken in the morning by builders (room 108)
On closer inspection our villa was old; pool was a bit manky and I think it was probably next to go on the demolition list. We asked if we could be moved to the new villas and later that day we were re-located to a beautiful shiny new 4 person pad with a gorgeous pool, wifi, huge kitchen dining area etc. (rooom 210)
We spent 3 days here only leaving when hungry as it was so nice.
Breakfast was standard.
My advice - make sure you get a new villa.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
362,Nice stay for relaxation and romance.,40,September 2010,"The hotel is currently still renovating their premises and the old standard villas. Must select the new deluxe villa. Villa are very new, clean and spacious. Can really enjoy quietness and relaxation here with your own private pool. Funny thing is a Bali hotel only serves Thai food but the food are quite delicious. A bit distance from main Seminyak street, hotel can arrange transfer to Seminyak area to your request. Airport transfer. Spa are basic and less of facilities but the masseur is very good.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
363,"Awesome, just a bit aged.",40,September 2010,"During my time there, the hotel was in the midst of renovations. My friends and I were situated in what seems the old sector of the Villas. The pictures represent the villas quite accurately and the service was fantastic. Room service was pretty quick and reasonably priced; the breakfast was great. You get a fridge that's not over stocked so you can get snacks and stuff at the convenient store across the road (from the back entrance).
The villa we stayed in seemed a bit aged though, which explains the need for renovations. Nevertheless, the place was very well maintained and very clean. Oh, the tv doesn't offer many channels, but you get a dvd player so that makes up for it.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
364,"Highly reccommend, chef is amazing",50,August 2010,"We initially stayed in one of the older villas of which there are 6 then were upgraded due to power problems. We were moved to a new villa. It was absolutely beautiful. I have stayed all over the world in hotels and I would recommend this place to anyone. The room s are practically new and everything work s and is completely fresh and clean. This place was recommended to me by a friend and I have not been able to thank him enough. I have to say that we go to Bali on average 2 times a year and this is the best place we have stayed. The chef is previously from the Four sessions hotel and cooks the most exquisite food. We would normally eat out in Bali every night but actually ended up having friends come to us and ordering a banquet which was not only cheaper but A1. I actually asked the chef for a couple of recepies before I left...The staff will bend over backwards to help. Our kids loved it and no need to worry about them making noise, you have enough privacy from others. Also have a very handy shuttle we used at least once a day.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
365,"Excellent Service, beautiful resort",50,September 2010,"This is my first time travelling to Bali with my spouse. We have read mixed reviews about Bali Rich and it didn't help when they didn't pick us up from the airport.
Everything changed for the better when we reached Bali Rich. They didn't receive my request for airport transfer as we sent out the email the day before we arrived. However, they still did a refund for the cab fare to us.
That is a very nice gesture. When we were brought to our villa, it was like 'WOW!'. Everything was what we wished for and even better.
The private pool looked very inviting and clean. The room was nicely done up and the toilet was extremely spacious with a big jacuzzi.
The breakfast was excellent and we ordered room service for the 2nd day due to our tight schedule and it was value for money. The location was excellent, just 5 to 10 minutes drive to Seminyak square and relatively near to Kuta as well. Anyway, they provide free transfer to Kuta, Legian and Seminyak.
The service was excellent in Bali Rich and the staff were extremely attentive and accomodating to our every requests.

I love Bali Rich and I would definitely recommend to all of my friends who plan on visiting Bali. And because of Bali Rich, I will definitely come back to Bali again and to Bali Rich as well.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
366,The worst experience ever!,10,July 2010,"Oh, where do I start? I had pre-booked this villa 4 weeks in advance for 9 nights as it seemed luxurious, cheap and perfect area!

Pick up from airport was nice, friendly. Mind you it was after midnite. On arrival we were told they didnt have the one bedroom villa (with jaccuzi ) as I had already booked online and was confirmed 2 weeks prio by them. so they gave us a 2 bedroom Villa with a jaccuzi, but closed off the other bedroom. We wanted to have a jaccuzi as we were exhausted and needed to chill, then to see that the hot water tap wasnt running, the plasma screen and volume of the jaccuzi wasnt working. So they sent in technician to fix it but couldnt. So for the next 3 nights we were constantly interrupted by technicians, by managers, by staff to fix bits here and there. The clock on the wall wasnt working!!!!

The next day we were told by the general manager Wayan, that we would be allocated to the Villa we originally booked. So we went shopping during the day and when we arrived at the Villa we were told by another staff member that they DIDN""T have any other villas available until 3 days before we check out. which meant they didnt have one at all and we had to stay at the one we were at.

I tried to get in touch with that manager so I can talk about the problem, but was told he was in singapore for business and wasnt goint to be back for 2 weeks . So I was introduced to the assistant manager and he had no clue what I was talking about. he said that nothing was documented and he has no idea about the problems we've been having!

Breakfast was shocking. One small sausace, 1 egg, 2 bites of bacon and half tomato..it looked like jail food! Taste was okay.I shopped and cooked for us as it was better quality. Food wasnt too crash hot either!

We had organised some tours so we requested 'wake up' call for 7am...We never recieved it and we nearly missed out on the tour.

We were told we had transport to and from the villa every day, but when we requested to be dropped somewhere they continuously told us the driver was out on a job and was unavailable. In 9 days we got that service twice. and mind you we were out and about every day a few times a day. So we spent quite a bit on taxi's.

They had on their site wireless but NEVER had any connection at all.

For the first 4 days we had no peace and quiet, our privacy was invaded by them walking in the villa randomly with towels or something and apologized for the mistake. They never called back when we requested help.

The staff members couldnt understand english so they would always reply with yes, thankyou, sorry! So it was just hell on earth. It got to the stage where I could no longer bare it and couldnt deal with them, so my friend tried to explain all the defaults in the place, about the poor service and he got fed up too.

It got so bad I called up booking.com in America ( whom I booked through) and had explained to them the situation. The operator was in shock and called the villa to try to sort the problem out. She called me back and said the manager is on his way to see me. Well, he NEVER came to talk to me. So on checkout, I had demanded I only pay for 5 nights since the whole stay was horrific. The manager wasnt too keen on that deal, but he had no option. I had told him he is lucky I'm even paying for the 5 nights considering I didnt get anything out of our stay like we were promised! He offered me one night free, free massage and dinner! But I didnt except it! And I paid him only 5 nights! Didnt even say thankyou, goodbye....i just got the hell out of there!

They really ruined our holiday! I am soooooo angry right this minute typing about this experience! Never again! And people shouldnt take this risk either. The Villas are beautiful but not worth the hassle..........",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
367,Excellent,50,July 2010,"We stayed at the Bali Rich Luxury Villas for one week, at an one bedroom deluxe Villa ( number 208 ) I have totally no complaints at all; everything was more than good. What we really liked about this place was the staff, they were extremly helpfull, always smiling and always provided an excellent service. On the top of that; the Villas were very clean and very spacious. If you stay at a villa, you've got very much privacy. There is a free shuttle available that brings you to Kuta. You can choose what kind of breakfast you like, and you can choose where you want to eat it; they can bring it to your villa, but you can also have it in the restaurant. If you would like to go there, I would recommend to book on they're own website, because they offer the most of the time a discount.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
368,"Great stay, value for money",40,June 2010,"Started well with being collected from the airport, offered cool towels and a drink, really appreciated.
The villa met all expectations, clean and roomy. Good situation, not far to walk to shops, restaurants and free transport offered for further afield. Staff very friendly, helpful and keen to make your stay as good as possible. Felt this villa was acurately portrayed and good value for money. Would recommend.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
369,HONEY MOON TO REMEMBER,40,March 2010,The expectations of our accomodation was meet when we entered our private villa.,Bali Rich Luxury Villa
370,I would not recommend this hotel,20,December 2009,"We stayed at Bali Rich for 4 days in December and was so disappointed. The hotel looks nothing like the website. It is in serious need for a renovation. Our air conditioning did not work and we heard other guests asking management for a refund because they were disappointed (management said no).

PLEASE NOTE: The showers are outside, which could be seen from a second floor window (which wasn't apart of the suite). We asked if anyone was staying there and maangement said no, but I still felt bothered that someone could be watching me shower.

I would pay $80 a night for this place, not $200.

However, the location was alright but on a busy road. The food from the restaurant was good however.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
371,Total relaxation,40,November 2009,"We stayed at the Bali Rich for 9 nights and loved it!!!! It isn't the most luxurious resort we have stayed in but there were some special touches such as the private pool and breakfast being prepared by your own chef, in our villa, that we really enjoyed. The rooms are simple and clean. The bed is king size and very comfortable. The rooms themself could probably do with a little freshening up and the furniture is a little dated but this didn't stop us from really enjoying our stay. The breakfast menu is limited but was always lovely. Each meal is accompanied by coffee/tea, fresh juice of your choice and fruit. The villa is located a 5-10 minute walk to the main shopping / restaurant area. We had no issue with the walk but if you prefer, you can book the shuttle which will drop you anywhere in Seminyak, Kuta or Legian, so the location really isn't an issue. They also provide a free transfer pick up/ drop off to the airport. We found the staff to be so friendly and helpful and always go out of there way to assist. They recommended the best restaurants to us and would arrange the reservations for us. The point of our trip to Bali was to relax and unwind... and this is exactly what we did. We spent much of our days relaxing in total privacy by our beautiful pool and didn't hear any noise from the other villas. If you wanted to go the whole day without seeing anyone else, this is very easily done at Bali Rich. Having said all this, I do think that they could do a little work on the reception / restaurant area and the main pool also looks a little dull... but to be honest, with your own pool, there really is no need to use the main pool. Overall, we had a really wonderful stay at the Bali Rich and would recommend it to anyone who was looking for nice accommodation in a good area. We booked online and payed approx AUD$150 per night and thought that this was really good value. Would definitely stay at the Bali Rich again!!!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
372,A decent private pool villa (not luxurious) which can do better!,30,December 2009,"I booked directly with the villa @ USD145 per nite for 3 days from 11th-14th Dec.

Free airport transfers, free shuttle (drop-off only) to seminyak, legian and kuta, wi-fi, breakfast and afternoon tea are included in the room rate.

There was NO mention in my confirmation email with the villa that I NEED to pay for the room charges in Rupiah and was annoyed that the receptionist can only insist without making up for their neglect in informing me in the first place. I'm using SGD back home and brought USD there.

Anyway, I was really looking forward to it after looking at the website's photos of the 1 bedroom private pool villa (not deluxe) and was a little disappointed. We were given villa 101 which is nearest to the lobby reception.

Firstly, there wasnt any tealights by the pool as shown in the website and I was told that we need to pay for it. The paint and furnishings of the villa have definitely seen better days. Again, it was mentioned that they provide 24hrs room service but actually its only up to 11pm.

To be fair, the pool is adequate for the both of us and clean enough to swim in be it day or night. : ) We absolutely enjoyed the privacy but noise can still be heard from the next villa and the vehicles parked outside the lobby reception. However, once you're in the bedroom area which is airconditioned, its really quiet.

There's a bathtub (very used) in the bedroom overlooking some plants outside and a standup shower in the open.

Their wi-fi is only good outside the bedroom area hence you can only enjoy the internet at the kitchen and pool area. The connection is really bad elsewhere.

Service was great! Their staff were always smilling and greeting you. Breakfast was always decent, served punctually and portions filling enough for us.

We didnt get to use the free shuttle to Kuta/Legian/Seminyak. My husband forgotten about the free service and called the reception to help call for a taxi to Kuta. The receptionist did not suggest the free shuttle service to him even though he knew we're going to Kuta. No initiative, period.

I'm not sure if I'm going back to Bali Rich again. That said, our overall experience was not bad and not fantastic either.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
373,OK hotel which good be great with a few upgrades,30,November 2009,"We stayed for 1 week with a 8 month old baby in a 1 bedroom villa not a deluxe villa. We got picked up in a new mini van from the airport given cold towels and water. When we arrived a welcome drink and check in was really easy.

When first shown the villa was really impressed had a wow factor but after staying a few days there was a few things that on closer exception made it feel tried and run down. The pond out side the bathroom is very sad looking, I felt very sorry for the fish who lived in the pond. As the plants where half dead . The TV only had 3 english speaking channels and 1 was the fashion channel very poor section as we where in the room allot of the time. Breakfast was OK but I got bored of the options quite quickly. And in the rooms some of the paint was peeling from the walls which gave it a feeling that it needs some attention.

The private pool was great and very private could swim naked if you wanted to. The bed was really comfortable and big as was the villa in general. Location wise you could walk easily down to all the really good restaurants on eat street or if your feeling lazy just get the free one way shuttle. The staff was great very helpful with a baby. They even baby sit for us one night and lent us a mobile phone incase my baby woke. Above expectation 5 star service. The food in the restaurant was good thai food but limited in choice.

Over all we had a really good holiday here but a few small things could have made this great.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
374,Bali Rich Villas - The perfect getaway!,50,September 2009,"We had just arrived at Bali and spent a day at Bali Rich before leaving to Nusa Dua. We immediatly decided that we had to come back for more days!!! And that's exactly what we did! Lovely people, great service, luxury villas, quiet and relaxing place. Complete privacy, private pool and a gorgeous surrounding. Imagine swimming at night or early morning!!! Located in Seminyak, it's a contrast between the intense busy life and a peaceful place to relax - just across the road. We highly recommend it! Mr. Bagus, the owner, was completly available for everything: tips how to bargain, best shopping places, best prices, shuttle at any time... You feel at home, belive me.
We had the perfect getaway! Thanks!

The villa was exactly described but is much nicer when you actually see it. The view from the private pool was stunning. It was so peaceful and relaxing. They even prepared the Jacuzzi Flower Bath for us upon our arrival. It really surprised us as we don’t request for it. We really fell in love with this Villa and the people. A big thanks to the lovely GM, Wayan Londra and his staff for the best hospitality during our stay. You all make our trip so memorable. I would definitely recommend this villa to anyone. Definitely a thumbs up to that place.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa

the breakfast was freshly made right in your villas.
location wise isnt that great, u have to take a cab or alternatively, u may rent a bike thru the villa, and ride around the place.
takes u 10min to reach kuta beach or legian shopping streets.
the ple there are quite frenly and helpful instead.
the private pool looks abit too dirty to swim in. alot of insects if u r an insect-lover.
a reli nice place to stay in. quiet and peaceful.
the service was reli great!!!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
378,"Seminyak Location, Great Pool Villas, Great Value",50,April 2009,"We stayed here during the easter period for 9 days. The location is great if you want to be in and around Semiyak and Jl Laskmana/Oberoi - its a short walk and you are there. All the great restaurants are within easy reach, and with the shuttle service provided to drop you anywhere, nothing is too far away. The service and courtesy of the staff was very good, and teh Thai restaurant recommended for great Thai food. Breakfast is a simple affair, and most mornings we chose to go out for our breakfast. Having a private pool means you stay in the villa a lot, and as such room service was very good, and the food very substantial and good quality. I would highly recommend these villas, they are quiet, private, have pools, and are perfectly located. Considering all of this the price great value for what you get. Go There !!!",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
379,Perfect!,50,May 2009,"My wife, son and I enjoyed our visit to Bali and the Bali Rich Luxury Villas. The level of attention that we were given by management and staff made our visit perfect. The owner even went so far as dropping us off at one of his favorite restaurants on his way home. We look forward to another stay and the Bali Rich in the future.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
380,Fantastic!!!!!!!,50,May 2009,"We book the villa during Matta Fair, it was a fantastic stay! We got a great deal, 2 nights free 1 night, 2 hours free massage and new villa. We have our own private pool, kitchen, Huge plasma TV with DVD player, Jacuzzi bath tub....etc....The staffs are friendly, the food not bad. They have free shuttle service to Kuta but need to inform them 2 hours before you need the shuttle. The massage was good although it was a bit painful, but i like it, they provide us ginger tea and flower bath after the massage, what a luxury time....",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
381,This Place Is Nothing Like The Website Photos Shown!,20,February 2009,"The hotel ""lobby"" was a space in an extended portion of it's tiny restaurant, shared with the concierge desk and waiting area. Checking in was not pleasant as the space was tight and we fought with our luggage to find a space to stand. A couple of men were smoking and that didn't make the front desk any more pleasant.
They placed us in the FURTHEST rooms possible which involved a walk over rundown bridges and uneven stone floors which were not sheltered in any way.We passed a moss-ridden water feature/pond of an evil green colour that spoke more for the level of service here than the false smiles of welcome. The worn out and slightly rusty children's swing and slide reinforced my gut instinct that I should run while I could,
When we finally arrived at our ""two bedroom - private pool"" villa, my husband, my friend and I were less than impressed by the rickety villa door, the pool of dirty water on our front doorstep and the musky smell that greeted us.
To our left, the ""pool"" was maybe the size of 3 average bathtubs in a row and was white tiled and looked ""sort-of"" clean. The pump area next to it was rusty and surrounding it was a bunch of dirty grey rocks over which 2 precariously balanced rickety deckchairs were placed.
To our right, was the ""living area"" which was made up of a dusty old fashion sofa set, a granite bar table and kitchen area, a fridge and water dispenser. The floor was made of tile and was sticky.
The most surprising thing was that although it was a 2 bedroom villa, the hotel failed to clearly state that one of the rooms was not ENSUITE! No, in fact, the 2nd bedroom, which our single friend took (it had twin beds) had a bathroom attached but the MASTER bedroom had no bathroom attached to it but in fact, we were to use an Unattached bathroom NEXT to the 2nd bathroom which had a mouldy CURTAIN as a door! This was not the shower curtain...this was actually what they used as the Bathroom Door!
The bathrooms were old and sticky and we used the amenities very gingerly. It was quite unacceptable but since it was an internet transaction as well as a one night stay, we decided to spend as little time as possible in the rooms.
Master bedroom: the 4-poster bed was too big for the room and sat against the aircondition unit blocking the ventilator so there was no air in the room.
The wardrobe was in the unattached bathroom. There was no mirror!
I really could go on but suffice it to say that a rehash of my experience here has already brought up such unpleasant feelings that I now feel it necessary to have a cleansing shower in my (attached) bathroom at home!
Oh, and it rained cats and dogs that evening and the next day. We got more wet trying to manouevre the oversized umbrellas supplied by the hotel through the too-narrow pathways and the uneven stone floors caused us to slip many a time and of course, find our feet sloshing through huge puddles of muddy water.
I would not recommend it to anyone.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
382,Bali Hideaway,50,December 2008,"We recently stayed at Bali Rich Luxury Villas last December 2008, and we truly enjoyed our vacation on this little boutique hotel offering excellent quality private villas including a private swimming pool, large bathroom, functional kitchenette & petit salon.
Our bedroom was immaculate , airy and the king size bed ultra comfortable.
From here we really discovered the real Balinese hospitality and met a professional and helpful staff , and efficient maid, and delicious meals from the Thai restaurant adjoined to
the villas lots. A friendly reception always ready to help you and answer to any question you may have, and providing nice recommendation on restaurants, sightseeing, cultural activities, or ordering a taxi. They also have a parking for guests use and a 24 hours security staff at the entrance.
We highly recommend this place in Bali, discovered by chance, very well located in Seminyak, away from the huge touristic and impersonal hotels on the beaches.
This piece of heaven mostly contributed to the success our holidays.
We met our Bali Hideaway. We specially thank the cheerful welcome from the manager Wayan who is a very nice host, always ready to help you on any circumstances.
We know now where to go and stay in Bali and we already planed to return for next Spring 2009 .",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
383,Totally loved it,40,November 2008,"My wife and I have just returned from a great trip to bali.
This being our first trip there,and the timing was sort of worrying us a little.as we flew in on the weekend the bombers were being
exicuted.
But we need not have worried at all,for we had booked in a place called bali rich villas in seminyak.
From the time we were picked up from the airport to the last day when we were droped back to the airport,the staff (now see them as friends)were so polite an helpful that they would put them selves out to ensure we had such a great time.
each villa has its own 7mtr x 3mtr lap pool which made for such a perfect private swim when ever you wished.
Then breakfast you could have them come and cook it in your rooms outdoor kitchen,or go up to the restuarant if you wished and eat there.
The room was excellent with a large bath in room and an out door shower that was just perfect as i gave you a sense of freeness.
Its also handy that in our package,we had drop offs to kuta,legian and seminyak (not that taxis are that expensive but its just realy coveinient and hand as they know the area.
Bali Rich Villas also has its own authentic thai restaurant,and believe me as a food lover it was be mouth watering.
the villas are just a couple of hundred metres from all the main
restaurants but far enough from all the hustle and bustle.
They can also arange peronal day trips for a reasonable price
in one of thier cars,which was just so relaxing and to feel like you could go out and trust the drivers was just so comforting.
bali rich was just finishing of some new villas on the property so cant wait to go back one day to stay in them.
Also found a few nice retaurants near by in,tratoria,bali cafe and more in the same street.
Once again i would like to thank Wayan Londra(general manager), Kestra (operations manager)a man who lives and breathes bali,and filled us full to the brim with knowledge.
and ""all the staff""the staf for gaurateeing us a wonderful holiday and also eliminating any worrys we might have had before we left.as Carol or myself now would not hesitate to return.

384,Bali Horror!! Checked Our After 2 Hours,10,March 2008,"The Bali Rich Luxury Villa is run down and horrible.

We were booked to stay in a bedroom villa during the easter peak season for 2 nights. We checked out after 2 hours.

They gave us a villa with no water, the bathrooms were filthy and mouldy. The grass was muddy. The public area was so small they could only fit 2 deck chairs (just enough room) next to the pool. The other 2 deck chairs were on the other side of the villa on the muddy grass. The deck chair umbrella had mould all through it.

In one of the rooms, the King bed is actually 2 twin put together.

My experience certainly tells you about the upkeep of the property. The no water obviously shows no one has stayed in the villa for a very long time.

The staff obviously knew about the problems as they were happy for us to leave and our travel agent was able to get a full refund and put us at another villa.",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
385,Great Bali Villas,40,November 2007,"My wife and I just got back form a week at the Rich Bali Villas. It was our 20th wedding anniversary and we wanted a special place to celebrate and were recommend the Rich Bali Villas by a friend. I am very glad that they did, the place and the staff are fantastic. The villa was beautiful and the private pool was great, the onsite spa is excellent and the ability to also have them come to Villa is an added bonus. We have an hour message at the spa complex then my wife and a pedicure and foot message back beside the pool in the villa.

The Villa’s are a little way out of the main area of Seminyak but the Villa’s have drivers who will drop you off wherever you want to go and you get a taxi back. This is no big deal as the most we paid for a taxi was 30,000 Rp or about $4 Australian and the was from the other side of Kuta back to the Villa. The really good night spots and restaurants of Seminkay like the La Luciola, Living Room, Kudeta are about a 10,000 Rp taxi ride home ($1.20 AUD)

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, the facilities are excellent and the cost is very affordable",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
386,good modern villa with its own swimming pool and kitchen...,50,October 2007,"Stayed in Bali Rich for 7 nights, the hotel was good. Its swimming pool and garden are both nice and are of very good size. You can have breakfast eith in the restaurant or in the villa. We had it in our villa every day. They came on time every single day and cooked it in front of us. It was good portion and they finish breakfast at 11am so if you have it late you won't even want lunch!
The hotel provides free shuttle to Kuta, Semiyak and other parts. It's free drop but no pick up but that's really fine I think. It's not expensive to travel back by taxi anyway, always under £3.
Hotel staff were all so friendly and welcoming. If you decide to walk to nearby town then it's only 15 minutes walk....",Bali Rich Luxury Villa
