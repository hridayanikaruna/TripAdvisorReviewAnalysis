0,Pleasant stay,50,January 2023,Again and again.. I always had such a pleasant stay in this hotel. The receptionist who named Wulan is always been such a great help and gave a 5 star service with the check in process. Also the staff and the cleaning service are friendly n did a great job with my room. The food especially the breakfast is really nice with lots of options. I couldn't recommend enough for this hotel. It's family friendly and it's in great location too.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1,"Good location, friendly service",40,May 2023,"Good location and reasonable price. The pool area is nice, we didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment on the food. The rooms do feel a little rundown, could do with some fresh beds and pillows. In saying that we slept fine. It’s a good option if you just want a good price/location in Seminyak close to all the action. But for a more “traditional” resort experience I would suggest elsewhere. Service was great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2,Simply the best hotel and staff - Amazing Stay,50,February 2023,"Amazing accommodation, beautiful suite and the staff were amazing and so accommodating, second time being here and would not stay any where else.
Was so surprised on my birthday, Manager greeted me with a beautiful cake and also lovely coffee, wonderful surprise.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
3,Great place to go for mild to wild,40,May 2023,The hotel pool is phenomenal and a seclusive gem that made the stay and experience worthwhile. We very much enjoyed the breakfast buffet that exceeded our expectations. You can’t escape the noise from the bustling street at any hour but this may be all of busy Seminyak.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
4,Hotel that exceeded expectations,50,May 2023,The hotel was a very positive experience..clean and modern with great breakfast and beautiful pool. Special mention to adi and novi at the pool bar and nanda on the eggs in the morning. We loved our stay and recommend this as a place to stay. In fact all the staff were friendly and polite could not fault.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
5,Haven,40,May 2023,"The hospitality, room, spa ,pool were all good. But you must understand that water is the basic necessity for all living beings and charging a guest for water is not done. Also, there were hardly any vegetarian options in the hotel menu. With a lot of guests coming in Bali from India, vegetarian options must be there in every hotel's menu",The Haven Bali Seminyak
6,Great service from Desi,50,May 2023,"Great service! Desi was the most helpful and lovely staff member working at the restaurant, she made our experience so welcoming! Would definitely return to this hotel for our next stay in Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
7,Needs Renovating,30,May 2023,"Stayed here for 7 nights recently and had a good time. The staff are amazing but the hotel is in desperate need of some renovations. We stayed in a family room at the back of the complex and the rooms were great. It has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a large lounge, kitchen/dining area. Air cons are cold but leak all over the floor, shower leaks thru the wall all over the bedroom floor making it quite dangerous. Beds are so hard it was very uncomfortable. Floor tiles cracked and uneven, mouldy shower head and wall around toilet. Like I said, rooms in desperate need of renovating. If you are planning on staying watch out for the uneven timber decking around the 3 back pools, the nails are sticking out, timber is water and sun damaged and my daughter fell through a few planks. Unfortunately I wouldn't stay here again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
8,A haven to enjoy. But eat outside.,30,May 2023,"we quite enjoyed our stay because it was like ' a resort in the city ""The staff are always smiley , friendly and helpful. But the food needs improvement ( both breakfast & the BBQ Seafood ). Budi the singer was really enjoyable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
9,Good Service,50,May 2023,"We are satisfied with this Service, Very Friendly….
Nova at Receptionist very helpful…. Very recommend to stay… Wonderful stay, Staff very helpful.. Will coming back again… Good location because close to beach…",The Haven Bali Seminyak
10,Outstanding,50,April 2023,"The customer service was outstanding, the friendly service beyond anything my husband and I expected. We felt like we were in such a safe and welcoming environment with such friendly staff we now call family.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
11,Guest experience,40,March 2023,"The staff were amazing special mention to Dharma out the front security, he is an asset to your business. Very friendly guy. The food was ordinary we ended up eating away from the motel, not a great selection for lunch at Tea, breakfast not so bad.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
12,"Good, not great.",30,March 2023,"Really good accomodation, we stayed in a pool access room, which was nice.
Unfortunately the food is really average and the location isn’t the best.
Overall, staff were lovely and the accomodation was great, just not in the right location for what I’m after, and the food was a real shame. Multiple meals were inedible.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
13,Dated rooms and below expectations,20,May 2023,"The rooms are very dated, not how it is reflected in the pictures. The bathtub is old, rusty, and dark. It definitely needs a replacement. Many parts of the room are patched up with chipped wood pieces. There was a cockroach in my room. The hairdryer was not producing hot air and needed a technician to fix it. It finally got fixed after putting in the request for 2 times. When asked for a standalone hairdryer in the replacement hotel does not have any, only the fixed one in the room. Housekeeping forgot to replenish toiletries and send up 2 sets of each when requested. However, when returned to the room the next day, one set was taken away by housekeeping! The air con malfunctioned a few times and I need a few attempts to get it running. Overall the room was poor. Staff are helpful but the service standard is not meeting guests needs. The location of the hotel is the only positive of the hotel. I would not stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
14,Awesome staff at the Haven,30,May 2023,"Some room features need updating, fridge not working, shower was luke warm and not draining and toilet leaks.

The staff, especially the cleaning staff were the best part of the Haven. They were friendly and accommodating.

5 stars ⭐️ for Agus and July who cleaned our room when we were sick. Nothing was too much trouble.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
15,Would not recommend it,10,March 2023,Would not recommend it. They couldn't even get it right to call an ambulance while my daughter was dying. 3 calls to the reception and 3 hours later they tell me they forgot to call the Ambulance. My daughter almost died.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
16,New experiance,30,April 2023,"Wall Bathroom so Dark, not clean.
Better change to bright color, breakfast menu boring, taste so so,
Need something to make people interisting stay at hotel.
Parking area small,
Hotwl People so nice",The Haven Bali Seminyak
17,"The best hotel in Seminyak, Bali",50,April 2023,"This is the best hotel one can choose in Seminyak! It is the best value for money.
The most important characteristic is the incredible team. I stay here for one month and receive the best attention one can only dream of. The team know my name, meet me with a smile and meet my dietary needs even.
Chef Bagus is in change of the restaurant and is able to prepare the healthiest yet nourishing dish for you with personal attention. Everyone is serving the food with the best smile and grace.
All facilities and services are great: suite, pool, spa, lounge area!
I would come back and never look for expensive alternatives where I will never be able to receive this attitude of respect! After al a holiday is about the way a place and people make you feel!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
18,Under Standard,20,April 2023,"We stayed in the 2bedroom suite and it was not very clean. The bench tops were really dirty under the light. The cutlery was not clean. In the restaurant you have to ask for Salt and pepper and even sugar.
I won't stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
19,very good,50,April 2023,Very good hotel. The hotel staff are very nice and helpful. Stayed in a pool access room. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast is also good. Hotel location is good. It took about 30 minutes by taxi from the hotel to the airport. I would stay there again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
20,The Haven,30,April 2023,"Was kind to get free upgrade. room is big and nice view at Balcony. however, room condition abit off maintain mode with crack flooring. Gym open at 8a.m so it is abit late for me. All the staffs are very friendly and helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
21,Fabulous stay!,40,April 2023,"Very friendly, lovely helpful staff. Great pool and facilities. We were in a room and would look at booking a suite or villa next time. Clean and tidy but a little tired. We still had a fabulous time and would come back again!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
22,"Family of 4, 2 bedroom suite. Breakfast for a Coeliac.",40,April 2023,"Great location, close to everything. Staff were 5 star. Thanks especially to Desi for sorting out gluten free breakfasts for my child. Good pools, pool bar wasn't great. Rooms are a little tired but comfortable and spacious. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite with 2 adults and 2 kids. Make sure you get an anti slip mat if your shower is over a bath, I have a huge bruise to show for slipping when getting in even though there was a pole to hold.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
23,A haven of calm in an idyllic location with the best staff ever,50,March 2023,"I arrived at The Haven after spending two amazing weeks in Ubud. The day I arrived was the day before Nyepi and the streets were crowded, everyone preparing for Silent Day.
Hotel staff were very helpful, having already organised events within the hotel confines for residents for Nyepi, explaining this and what is expected from guests.

The hotel is large, split into two buildings both with pool areas. The main breakfast/dining area overlooks the bustling Main Street and is a great place to enjoy a meal and observe busy Seminyak life. Food and drink options were plentiful and tasty.

The bedroom was a good size, overlooked the pool with a balcony, the room would benefit from an update but it was clean, had air conditioning and a fridge.

I used Atma Spa and had a wonderful Balinese Massage in beautiful surroundings, a lovely experience.

I had expected yoga to be included as a regular daily event, however, as this was not possible Adhi, Front Office, arranged private yoga sessions for me at a very reasonable price. I met with Yoga Instructor also called Adhi, on a couple of occasions and had a fantastic workout with him, I was very happy with that and would have booked more if there was time.

Overall the secret to this hotels success is it’s staff, I have stayed in many hotels all over the world but the staff here are absolutely amazing, so courteous and kind, everyone greets you and goes out of their way to help, best staff ever.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
24,Overcharged for one night & constant room issues ruined my stay,20,April 2023,"I stayed at the Haven on my first solo trip to Bali so had a lot of affection for the hotel as my previous stay was wonderful. Unfortunately however the Haven is simply a shell of the hotel that it once was.

The stay began poorly when I was allocated a twin single room on the roadside of the hotel even though I had paid extra for a pool view room (in order to avoid the road noise), whilst I agreed to stay in that room for one night only, no compensation was offered at all to account for me having paid an additional fee for the pool view.

I was then transferred to room number 2 of my stay, and this room appeared to be ok until I went to take a shower only to find out that the shower didn’t work correctly with engineering needing to be called to fix the issue. What ever the engineering department did to fix the shower ended up resulting in a grinding noise coming from the pipes every 5-10 minutes throughout the following night and into the day. I reported this to the night clerk, who advised that he would have engineering back to fix the issue the next day which didn’t happen. When I went to check in with the front desk about when engineering would be back to fix the issue, I was simply told not to worry about it as it was only the pipes. It wasn’t until after I stated that I couldn’t sleep with it occurring every 5-10 minutes that the front desk clerk very reluctantly agreed to change me to a new room.

I was then transferred into room number 3 of my stay, only to find out that this room lacked both a functioning lock on the balcony door and did not have a safe in the room, so the room wasn’t safe & securable. It was only after complaining to the front desk once again that they very reluctantly sent engineering up to fix the lock & install the safe. I then stayed in that room for the rest of my trip even though it had an intermittent power issue where the power would flicker off/on in the mornings.

I sent through a written complaint via the hotel’s contact us page, however the hotel management has completely ignored this complaint to this point.

This meant that I spent the first 4 days of my stay having to deal with room issues which pretty much ruined the rest of the trip for me. It’s very clear that the management of the hotel has not been conducting basic room checks or maintenance on the rooms as they are currently well below what would be expected of a 4 star hotel

Throughout the room changes it became apparent that these issues were not limited to my stay, as there were a number of others experiencing similar issues and being shuffled around the hotel from one substandard room to another .

The only saving grace was that the restaurant, engineering & housekeeping staff were very friendly

Overall a very very disappointing stay",The Haven Bali Seminyak
25,"Amazing Hotel in Seminyak, great team, Perfect location.",50,April 2023,"Amazing experience, great location, delicious food.

27,Room issues made the stay average,30,March 2023,We have stayed at the Haven many times and enjoyed it but this time we had a number of room issues that spoilt our stay there. Starting with a balcony door that would not open. A beeping safe that kept us awake and being locked out mid stay.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
28,"Wonderful Staff, Wonderful place!!",50,April 2023,"We just completed a 3 night stay at the Haven, it was wonderful! The rooms were spacious, the pool was great and the restaurant not only had a great breakfast ( which was included on our package) we also ate a great dinner there! You were in the action right out the door ( but your rooms were back in the quiet area) lots of shops and places to eat and 10 min walk to the beach. But the best thing about the Haven was the staff!! Absolutely incredible people! So polite, catered to your every need, happy to help! From the front desk to the restaurant staff to the people who cleaned your room they were top notch! I will single out 2 who were so helpful to us, they were Endang in the restaurant and Dewaii at reception! Both made our stay that more memorable! I would definitely stay again and would recommend it to anyone.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
29,"We loved the pool access room, you can walk straight out to the pool or su lounges.",50,March 2023,"We loved our stay at the Haven. The buffet breakfast was really nice. The room towels and sheets were very clean. We had a pool access room, which we highly recommend. The pool was beautiful to sit and look at while having a refreshing drink just outside our room. The resort is bigger than you first realise, with another section further down with another two pools and villa style accommodations. Bintang supermarket is just a few steps away. We'd definitely stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
30,Waited till midnight and paid 25% more at the hotel,30,April 2023,"Waited till midnight and paid 25% more at the hotel

One of the worst experience check-in experience. I arrived 9pm at Haven - drenched as there was no proper shelter - and only got my room 3 hours later at 12 midnight. 🥲🥲

There was a booking error with Agoda, and I was made by the front desk to pay 25% more for the room that I had booked. After 2 arduous hours, it was already 11pm and I had no choice but to continue staying at Haven.

The exterior of the place is really pretty and insta-worthy. However, the room is very poorly maintained. Among other issues, the main thing is that many of the floor tiles are cracked and that shower wasn't working properly.

Finally, why am I taking time to write this review? Overall, the sweet staff and nice bed made my stay very comfortable.

There were just many problems that made this stay a nasty one. I shortened by 4 night stay and left on the 2nd night. 😪😪",The Haven Bali Seminyak
31,A lot of work to be done,20,March 2023,"Breakfast was extremely poor most playes empty and not refilled after asking for more.
Bar staff must be fully trained to make cocktails Strawberry Dacquiri was an off white colour should be a strawberry colur.
Massage area difficult to get any attention and no rails if walking down the stairs.
Decking is a danger hazard",The Haven Bali Seminyak
32,Our stay at The Haven Resort Bali Seminyak,30,March 2023,"Have to say the room we stayed in was comfortable but the location of the room was very boring with 2 quarter of the balcony facing a wall the other quarter had a wall covering the pool! And to be located more or less on top of the bar pool and to hear that music would probably have suited a younger couple!
What saved the stay was the staff, all terrific 👏 two who was exemplary great was Arayana and Daisy in the restaurant. Both are a credit to the resort. So helpful, polite and always with a smile,take care of them! Regards Solveig Borg",The Haven Bali Seminyak
33,Friendly helpful staff and great location,40,March 2023,"Great service , great location , very friendly, excellent breakfast and lovely pools. Best service from a lovely worker Sima Dedi who went out of her way to look after us and made our stay very comfortable",The Haven Bali Seminyak
34,Please Be Kind!,40,March 2023,"The place is nice, the room is spacious, really worth the penny! All staff is nice.

but...

Please, don't differentiate local guest with the foreigner. Just because we don't have any tipping habit, it doesn't mean we can't pay.

All the staff is very helpful except one person in the information desk (not the one who greeted me when I checked in and checked out because they're very kind), a man with attitude who doesn't smile and gave me a cynical look just because I ask him with Indonesian Language and he spontaneously smile to other foreigner guest right after me. Such a shame!

We all know and experienced the worst time back in the pandemic, hope those time can be an enough lesson for all of you in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
35,Great job,50,March 2023,"Stayed for one night and it was memorable! The room is very nice, clean and cool AC.well maintained.add more bathrobe pls.
Fancy gym with excellent tools, clean and nice swimming pool will definitely come back!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
36,The Haven are real heaven,50,March 2023,"Hotel is nice and close to the beach. they provide free shuttle to The Haven beach club.
The hotel was clean and also the room.
Check in very easy and they serve fresh welcome drink and cool towel, its lovely.
Ketut from tour counter really nice and he takes us around Bali. Ubud and Sanuru are recommended.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
37,Naturally Excellent!,50,March 2023,"Before covid my experiences at the Haven where already excellent. During my last visit my expectations have been exceeded. As all hotels have gone through tough times to keep their standards high, the Haven succeded to improve their service.
Rooms did get an upgrade. The wooden floors have a luxurious appearance. Our room was cleaned by Nanda. He did good job to provide clean towels every day and clean everything on time in the morning.
At frontdesk the service is genuine friendly. All requests are handled efficiently. Before a problem might come up Whulan, Adhi and Ryan already offer a solution to make your stay at the Haven without anything to worry about.
The restaurant Sabeen is open 24 hours. It is a good place to start your day with a large breakfast. The variety of different food is impressive. Also for dinner I like to recommend Sabeen. Live music to entertain you while having a delicious meal. All served by friendly staff like there are Ayuh, Desi, Endang and Kartika.
I am already looking forward to my next holiday in Bali, I certainly will come back later this year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
38,Warm engagement,50,March 2023,"The overall experience is great! I booked mine through booking.com and didn’t realise I needed to indicate whether I wanted a double twin bed or queen bed, which I preferred. I was lucky enough that there’s a spare room with a queen bed on the second day and the manager, Ahdi, kindly arranged that for me.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
39,Read the reviews .,20,March 2023,"Poor management with over worked stressed staff is a bad combination for a hotel’s operations. Misleading photos on the hotel website . Nowhere near the beach . Poor and inconsistent breakfast . Have to request things multiple times .
A very bumpy Bali experience .
I wouldn’t return to the haven .
Can’t use your credit cards if your pins more than 6 digits . Weird !!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
40,"The Haven, picturesque a must place to stay",50,February 2023,"What a wonderful stay we had. We stayed for 2 weeks in a 1 bedroom apartment which was huge. Staff from the 1st day till the last were ALL accommodating. super helpful and so friendly which made our stay at The Haven memorable. Remembering ours names made us feel so special.
Buffet breakfast was appealing with so much on offer from western to Asian dishes. The afternoon complimentary tea was a special touch which we frequented often. 3 pools surrounded by lush landscape gardens was so appealing, pool deck chairs to relax and unwind.
I would highly recommend staying at The Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak
41,Great experience.,50,March 2023,"We had group check-in at The Haven for business meetings for 4 days in March 2023. We stayed in Haven Suite 2. The room was big, clean, and comfortable. The coffee break and food for lunch were delicious.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
42,"Couldn’t have had better service from Adhi, Guest Service Manager",50,March 2023,"I arrived late one evening to my room, which had been specifically asked to have a great view from the balcony. Alas it viewed the side wall of the lift shaft, room 3001, and had a very disappointing view. As I was here for 12 nights I thought I would try to be moved. No joy before I unpacked the essentials so went to bed.

The next morning I enjoyed a great breakfast and headed to reception, where I met Adhi, Guest Service Manager. You could not meet a more cheerful, kind, happy man, and he promised me he would try his best to sort this issue out. He asked me to go back to my room and await a phone call, I expected this could be just a way to move me on from reception counter and have me await ages for this call.

BUT in 5 minutes he called to say he found a room and came immediately to escort me to inspect it. It was PERFECT, room 4018 with a stunning view high above the pool.
I cannot praise Adhi enough for his customer care and resolving my issue so quickly, thank you so much.

This is not only a hotel that cares and looks after its customers but is really comfortable with beautiful pools and stunning gardens.

Plus ALL the staff greet you every time the see you making you feel really special.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
43,It was amazing performance of the music. I love the way he sing. Igo i think was the name,50,March 2023,"Very amazing , i love the food, i love the all staff, sugi, pardita they was little crazy. I feel like a family here, they served it very well more over they are very friendly. Very conformable places",The Haven Bali Seminyak
44,Definitely good value for money .,50,March 2023,"Well .. I checked in 4th March 23 not knowing WHAT to expect .. am pleasantly surprised.. was given what is called a JUNIOR SUITE which seemed "" good value for money "" to me . Its large , clean and everything works perfectly of course but what's nice is the placement of everything .. from the bed to the basins showers etc etc ..all thoughtfully done and planned so as to be customer friendly. Kudos .
The service so far ( this is my third day ) has been outstanding. From the driver who picked me up at the airport ( advisable to ask the hotel to send you their car if you're a first time BALI visitor ) , to the reception staff , to the room service and restaurant service staff ..always smiling always cheerful .. all of them professional yet warm and polite with that sorely required human touch which I've seen lacking at so many hotels worldwide.. truly a blessing to be treated so warmly .
I'm going to be here 5 days more . Oh yes .. did I mention ?? The breakfast buffet is extremely satisfying..varied to suit almost any palate it caters to all tastes and the flavours are international as well as local if you so desire .
I'll update this write up once more on checkout though I doubt it can get any better .. they're already 5 star in my book on most counts .. the pool looks georgeous and I'll try that too tomorrow .
I'd recommend a stay here without any hesitation.
The location is about as central as you could desire with everything from restaurants to beaches ..clubs to bars all within a ten minute stroll .
What more could one ask for ?
Thank you HAVEN for helping make my first ever BALI trip such a memorable one.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
45,Great Place to stay in Seminyak,50,March 2023,Beautiful property. Central to great shopping & restaurants. Staff are lovely. Rooms are spotless. Breakfast was lovely. Great amenities and pools. Friendly people everywhere. We had a one bedroom pool view with a big daybed on the balcony.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
46,My favourite place to stay in Bali,40,February 2023,I have been staying at the Haven for around the last 8 years off and on. The staff are friendly and the food is nice. Rooms are generally in good condition. Situated with walking distance to 66 beach. And it is the best of both worlds for location if you want to go upmarket you can go further up in Seminyak or go down to Kuta if you're on a strict budget. I will be coming back. Thanks Haven,The Haven Bali Seminyak
47,Nice Stay,40,March 2023,"Had a short two night stay here and must say found everything great

53,Friendliest Hotel In Bali,40,February 2023,"My wife and I have travelled to Bali many times over the years and stayed at various hotels and villas but have gravitated to staying at the Haven after many enjoyable stays.
The main reason for our decision is the friendship we have developed with several of the beautiful Haven staff.
These staff make us feel like we are coming back to a welcoming home each time we arrive. Staff like Suardina who is our villa butler and provides us with a level of service that we cannot find anywhere else in the World. He is well supported by support workers who refresh our room and private pool everyday.
Each morning we go to the front of the Hotel for our breakfast and are greeted by Ayu who makes your dining experience perfect. Her natural sense of fun shines though her beautiful personality.
These and other staff like them are the reason we return to Bali and what we like to call OUR HAVEN.
We have noticed after the terrible pandemic the world suffered in the last few years the Haven has lost several great staff but we can see with the return of staff like Suardiana and Ayu the Haven the future looks bright and we look forward to returning again very soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
54,5 star,50,February 2023,"You don’t really need to go to 5 star hotel when you have The Haven, the staff are 5 stars the location is 5 star.

59,Watch out for Flies,40,February 2023,"Cannot fault the Staff very good service also great location.
Great hotel if you’re only going to be there for a short stay .
My biggest objection was Breakfast NOT COVERED and Fly’s crawling over food to make us sick .
I did air my views to staff and so did other people too which they put a couple of SMALL covers over plates but not big enough to cover therefore fly’s crawled underneath and still crawling over the food
So just keep an eye on this If this was corrected it WOULD have been a lovely breakfast. But I went back to old school of eggs in shell and banana’s in skin as a lot of Bali Belly there at the moment",The Haven Bali Seminyak

61,Great stay!,50,February 2023,"Everyone was super super friendly, and I felt tremendously well taken care of for the 6 nights that I stayed. Water, toiletries replaced every day and a lovely big comfy bed (they moved me from a twin to a double room after one night as that was all they had and it was done smoothly and promptly).

I paid for breakfast one day only because I like to go out and explore and try new places but what I had that once was excellent - lots of choice and continuously refreshed.

The pool was lovely and cool and there were plenty of loungers. Check in and check out was simple and easy. I booked their car service to and from the airport and it was very convenient.

Would absolutely stay again - the people made it an amazing place to stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

67,Mosquito heaven!,10,February 2023,"My 2 year old went for on vacation. The room was a deluxe pool room paid for. The room it’s self was decent, not flash but fine. However the room was not secure, the gaps between the sliding doors was at least 2cm, I could fit my finger through. And the mossies loved their entryway. My son was attacked repeatedly throughout even when having to sleep in long clothes (in a hot environment) and biug spray!

I was super angry and complained to no avail.

Do not recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
68,A little bit of Heaven at The Haven,50,January 2023,"Wayan and his staff put our comfort and enjoyment first, going out of their way to resolve the unexpected maintenance issues. I would encourage anyone to talk to the staff team members before giving negative feedback. Without the relevant information from guests the staff team cannot resolve the issues that may arise.

We have appreciated how welcomed we have been made to feel. With many of the staff team making the effort to learn our names. I tried to learn their names too but will miss many in my attempt! Thank you Wayan, Desi, Dewi and her male colleague who was always so happy to see me! To Sarah, Sima and their reception colleagues. To the pool and beach club staff and to our room service who added many personal touches to our towels. To all for making my birthday special. Thank you.

Thank you to everyone behind the scenes who clean, maintain and cook, especially the wonderful Indonesian supper you made me, oh and the adored crispy bacon and baguette bread!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
69,"The Haven, Seminyak. 1 Bed Villa.",40,February 2023,"We are Wyndham owners and we stayed here because Wyndham Dreamland was not finished. The Haven is exactly what it says, a great place to relax and unwind from all of the street stall hustling and traffic.
The staff here are extremely friendly and polite, our Villa #607 is fantastic, although last night there was an impromptu party in the main pool at 3am and our Villa is next door. But hey, this is Bali.
The Indonesian Cooking Experience is something worthwhile fun and delicious. Our hosts, Kartika and Ery took us to the market for ingredients, showed us knife skills, preparation, cooking and finally served up our feast in the restaurant. Recommend this, absolutely. $50 AUS / head. This also included a few Binning which were magically refilling.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
70,The best hotel experience,50,February 2023,"We only meant to stay in this hotel for only 2 nights as we're planning to try out few different hotel/villa in Seminyak. However we ended up extended our stay until the end of our holiday.

The staff were really friendly, the service was excellent, and the breakfast buffet was really good. Our highlights is one of the staff charging on the eggs station were always put on extra - He always put smiley face with tomato sauce on my kids plates and always greet them so nicely. I love how simple things like that really made our day.

Also at the end of our stay, they packed us some breakfast box when we had to check out at 5.30 am. Overall it was the best hotel experience with the best value for money. I will definitely come back and stay at this hotel again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

The staff were always friendly and helpful, the rooms were generous in size and all of the facilities were excellent. The meals were great and offered many options.

The kind size bed suitable for 3 of us and our daughter got free breakfast. Hotel located at startegic area, close to Beach Clubs in Seminyak and Canggu where we planned to visit.

82,Maintenance desperately needed,30,January 2023,"While the Haven has fabulous, friendly & attentive staff & service, the owners PHM hotels really needs to invest in some substantial maintenance. Our room (2 bedroom suite) was very spacious, but in desperate need of maintenance. The shower over bath is very deep and very broad, and the bathroom floor very slippery, meaning getting out was hazardous. There was a pole next to the shower screen, which I held on to to steady myself when getting out, only to have the rusted join give way, and I fell and hurt myself - big bruise! Do not use this shower, use the walk in one in the smaller bed/bath in the suite. Some of the decking surrounding the rear pools also desperately need replacement. It’s very sad as this hotel would have been great in its day, and if it had been properly maintained, still be fabulous. The food wasn’t good either. Room service food was cold on arrival. I’ve stayed at the Haven previously and was happy, which is why we came back. But I won’t be back again I’m afraid. Time for the owners to raise the hotel to the level of the wonderful staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
83,Between a 3 and a 4,40,January 2023,"I am torn in writing this. The Haven has LOTS of good qualities but quite a few shortcomings.

It is a really lovely pool area and the staff are polite and welcoming. The pool guys are lovely. The rooms are clean. The beds are comfy. The 2 bed suite was spacious and cool.

The bathrooms are however completely leaking and the water damage is horrific. The shower in our bathroom was useless.

The spa is overpriced and not great.

The restaurant food is fine. It is well priced. Average not amazing but acceptable. Buffet breakfast in Lemoncello was lovely - generous selection, fresh and yummy.

The location handy to shopping but a little walk to beach.

We felt very welcome. Not sure if we would return but had a nice stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
84,LOUD MUSIC AT NIGHT TIME SO CANT SLEEP,10,December 2022,Stayed here for a week with my partner and every night we could hear loud music playing until 3am. The music was so loud that we kept waking up and didn’t get a good nights sleep. Very annoyed!!! The music came from the bar downstairs which is attached to the lobby. Don’t stay here if you want to relax and have a good nights sleep,The Haven Bali Seminyak
85,"Good From Far, But Far From Good",30,January 2023,This hotel presents themselves very well online. In reality the facility is very worn. The lack of upkeep is noticeable and disappointing. On the service side I thought the staff was kind and hospitable. In the mornings the hotel serves a good breakfast with a nice variety of options. The surrounding area is incredibly busy and the property is walking distance to the beach. We found the local beach very disappointing and incredibly dirty. Sad to see a beach littered with garbage.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
86,Not as per expected,20,December 2022,"We booked one bedroom suite, and apparently its located at the other end of property and no one accompany us to show our room, they just pointed out where to go (and one of the lift at this end was broken, luckily we only need to climb 1 floor). we have to wonder here and there to get to the room initially. the room is quite old, not properly maintained, cleanliness can be much improved, as the floor is quite dirty and we have asked many times to clean the floor more, but its just the same. the room has kitchen but no pan and pot, not even dishwashing soap and we have to asked for the plates etc. TV is small and outdated. when we asked for dishwash liquid, they didnt response, even to tell us that its not available. breakfast is basically egg station, some noodle, rice, pastries, fruits and salads. the taste and quality was not that good. the worse part is the service, the staff are friendly but they cannot help to solve your problems. they just stand there and smile and nothing they can do. we came to breakfast and it was full but actually there are few table of 4, occupied by only 2 person. they staff just say, no space and smile. thats it. no trying to help us find solution. we saw a supervisor and he seem to know this issue but he didnt take action too. it take forever to get bellman to help us with luggages. and he left us waiting for the car, and said security will help, well they look hesitate and only helped with one bag out of 5. their beach club only until 5 pm. and only 2 shuttle a day. It is not what we expect from what we thought to be 4 star hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
87,Nice Hotel for Family. Good Location. Value for money. This is our second visit after few years a go. Im happy to stay,40,January 2023,"Nice Hotel for Family. Good Location. Value for money. This is our second visit after few years a go. And more extended type of accomodation such as suite and villa. Definitely recommended for single stay of family stay.

My family took a Deluxe suite with connecting room to other room.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
88,Great Stay,40,December 2022,The hotel location is good and the room is spacious. Was lucky enough to be upgraded to suites. The staffs were friendly. There were two main pools and two dining spaces at separate wings. The only downside would be the hotel is a bit old.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
89,Feedback,30,December 2022,"The crews are too slow response that may caise by tje rooms are located in the spread area.
The informastion given by hotel was no valid regarding the ""Haven Area"" in the double six beach. We didn't find it.

In certain day, we have no towel, and the crews gave info that theyvare still waiting from the laundry 😅
The shower is broken.

Need to improve",The Haven Bali Seminyak
90,Worst!,10,December 2022,Not worth it! I instantly regret it cos I blindly booked 5 nights straight away (non refundable!) without even realized that the hotel was so old and ironically we paid for suite room. The bathroom was so bad. They don’t have separate shower and it is odd they installed rain shower above the bath tub. The tub was so high it was so dangerous for the kids to shower in them. Worst experience ever. Do not book the suite room!!!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
91,Excelent Reception Service Tanks Sima,40,December 2022,"The Room was good, but the hotel employees especially Sima and Mita was really excellent and kindness.

96,Recommended Hotel with Big Room and Delicious Breakfast,40,May 2022,I love this hotel as this hotel has very wide bedroom and delicious breakfast. My room wasn't soundproof so that I could hear the singer sang in the hotel resto every night. I only could sleep after midnight when the hotel resto closed.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
97,Once an unreal hotel ….,10,December 2022,"Our stay in The Haven, Seminyak made us think, “Wow! This hotel must have been amazing when it opened!” Rather than, “Wow! This hotel is amazing!”

We enjoyed our stay in Bali but we were disappointed with The Haven Seminyak. The hotel is quite old and outdated.

ACCOMMODATION:

These are a list of issues we had with the accommodation:

Sinks/Showers: The sink in the bathroom was constantly blocked (see photos). We asked them to fix it which we think they did but it only worked for a few hours before clogging again. The shower was also clogged and drained very slowly. The sink in the kitchen was broken and funnelled water onto the kitchen floor.
A/C: The A/C didn’t work the first night - the room was so warm. They did fix it when we asked. One remote in our room didn’t work.
Generally outdated: Cracks on the floor. Mould around the bathtub/shower. Rotting wood/mould in the bathroom walls. Damp on walls in the hotel in general (see photos). The phone in our room was old and had buttons missing on it (see photos).
Gym: The gym was small and the equipment was rusty. On one occasion the gym wasn’t open when it was supposed to be opened. I asked about it but they didn’t give a reason. I was frustrated that this information hadn’t been distributed.

On the plus side:

Swimming pool: The pool was clean and a good temperature.

FOOD & SERVICE:

Clothes rack: We hung some wet clothes on the balcony. We were informed by phone that we couldn’t do that. We requested a drying rack twice but didn’t receive one. We received a letter under the door telling us again that we couldn’t have clothes on the balcony. We eventually received a drying rack two days later.
Lunch/dinner: We’d rate the food 1/5 as well. It was the worst meal we had in Bali.
Breakfast: We’d rate the breakfast 2/5. It wasn’t very nice - some of the ‘warm/hot’ items were cold and didn’t taste nice. It’s only redeeming feature was the freshly cooked omelette.
Free cocktails/beers: We were offered two free cocktails and four beers each day … anything free you can’t really complain. The selections was pretty poor though. The beers could only be Bintang and the cocktails were a selection of 6 - two of which looked radioactive in colour!

On the plus side:

Free cocktails/beers: They would deliver them to our room for free upon request!
Staff: All the service staff are very very friendly!

CONCLUSION:

We’ll chose a different hotel the next time we’re in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
98,"Lovely pool , nice staff",40,December 2022,"I love staying at the Haven. The pool is really nice. Staff are very professional especially Adi on the pool deck, he was always smiling and asking if you need anything. Perfect customer service. The only negative thing was the night across the street . The music was loud and I could hear from my room until 3 or 4 in the morning",The Haven Bali Seminyak
99,Really feels like a haven. ✌️😌🌴,40,December 2022,"Overall very nice place. Getting a bit old but very well maintained. Staff is super friendly and helpful.

105,Family of 4,40,December 2022,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The location was great (in fact, the location is hard to beat as the life of Bali is going on all around this hotel), the amenities were good and the food was pretty great too. The staff were kind, helpful and so welcoming.

We had the buffet breakfast each morning and this set up our ravenous children for the day. Our family of 4 with (7yo & 11yo) stayed in one of the 2bdrm suites looking over the pools. The room was spacious, very well airconditioned and the furniture was nice (The humidity of Bali had clearly gotten to the dining table and it was probably in need of replacement). The premises is probably in need of some aesthetic ""touch-up"" updating which looks like it probably stopped during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The hotel looks like they are doing this currently.

There were some issues with the cleanliness of our room on arrival and in particular the bathroom. The bathroom did seem to slowly get cleaner over the time that we stayed there. Would I recommend this place to family and friends? Yes",The Haven Bali Seminyak
106,Not so Havenly....,30,December 2022,"The Haven is located conveniently to many good restaurants and shops.

We did not have to catch a taxi and walk for miles each day all around the hotel.

It has a resort feel. Staff are naturally friendly.
I have only 1 comment and that has to do with the toilet. It is obvious ly dated and the tap contact is worn out and loose. Unbecoming of a hotel. Also the Wc flush is clearly weak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

108,1 Bedroom Villa - Amazing,50,December 2022,"My wife and I stayed in a 1 bedroom villa in November/December 2022. The villa is massive. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom/shower also quite large and clean. The private pool was spotless and a great place to chill out during the day (location is very quiet).

I would also like to show my gratitude to the staff as well - from the moment we arrived they were extremely polite and professional. We will definitely be coming back next year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Check in and check out are handled very well by the front office staff. Always willing to assist if you need anything. I like to name Nova who handled the check out very efficient.
The rooms at the Haven are spacious and most of them are renovated. In the bathroom most toiletries are provided. Agus from housekeeping did good job with cleaning the room thoroughly every day.
If you do not feel to go to the beach. You can launch at the pool. The pool boy Adi will provide you with sun bed and clean towel.
The breakfast at Sabeen has a broad variety of different kind of foods. It is a popular place for breakfast by hotel guests or guests from outside. When it was busy Eka was always there to make sure a table was set up and and arranged so the day started very good.

118,Amazing resort with Excellent facilities and Excellent Customer Service,50,October 2022,"Our first stay at The Haven Seminyak resort lived up to all the expectations we had. Firstly the restaurants were absolutely amazing. There is something different every night in the restaurant to try from BBQ nights, Seafood nights and a large variety of western and Indonesia dishes to try. Sugi Kopling one of the restaurant managers whom we now regard as a friend was friendly, attentive and happily gave recommendations and attended to all the patrons needs. He has an awesome team in the restaurants and again, nothing was too much trouble. Desi was such a lovely lady and spoke to the patrons every day calling them by name which is such a lovely customer service touch. The smorgasbord of breakfast included in our deal was huge and set the day up. The room service was amazing too and price wise, all meals are really good value.
We booked a villa with private pool which was simply gorgeous. The house keeping and pool maintenance team were fantastic. Our room was spotless every day. Agus and the team were always friendly, worked quickly and were attentive to any requests we had. Our pool maintenance man was a really happy guy who took the time to stop and say hello to us every day and ask us if we needed anything.
We liaised with Febby before our arrival and sought us out on our arrival to introduce herself to us face to face.
The general manager Wayan went out of his way every morning to walk around speaking to guests and making sure they are happy with their stay and getting customer feedback offering to contact him with any needs. The customer liaison officer also spoke with guests chatting to them and getting feedback on their facilities. The location is perfect with everything you could want.
I honestly cannot say enough good things about this resort and the staff that run it. You won't be disappointed staying at this resort.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

125,Cooking class The Haven Seminyak,50,November 2022,"The day started with a visit to the market to pick up some fresh produce.
Chef Bagus was really great pointing out the fruit and spices we would need.
The menu consisted of a chicken broth, chicken skewers, pork skewers, nasi Goreng, mee Goreng, Tiger prawns and fish wrapped in banana leaves, and for dessert caramelised banana with pandas and jack fruit. This menu was all of our own choosing.
We returned to the hotel and Chef Bagus prepared the fruit and a coffee for morning tea.
The cooking commenced and we learnt so much about preparing spices and had some good laughs along the way.
At the end we ate the meal and left with a certificate and the recipes so we could recreate our authentic Indonesian dishes at home.
Thankyou to Wulan for the recommendation, to Chef Bagus for the unlimited information and fantastic meal, to assistant Chef Ricky and Ayu for her funny commentary and conversation.
The day started at 0900 and wrapped up by 1430hrs.
Definitely money well spent. I highly recommend this class.
Cost 500,000rp. Very well worth it",The Haven Bali Seminyak

All the staff are friendly with a a smile on their faces constantly. You have access to 3 pools whilst visiting. The Pool bar attached to the hotel pool was fabulous and so accessible from the pool. After a day of site seeing, or just wandering around the areal, we loved sitting and relaxing with a drink in the restaurant area before getting ready for dinner. Loved my 3 week holiday at this hotel r and looking forward to make it an annual holiday with the family.

I would like to express my thanks and appreciations for the excellent hotel guest services and care I have received throughout my entire stay at the Bali Haven Semiyak hotel which is located in the heart of the city centre. Perfect location. Relaxing pools and the Balinese massage was totally worth a visit. Thank you for making my holiday in Bali so wonderful and memorable! As it was a peak season, the hotel was fully booked. Mr Wayan have gone the extra miles by helping me to secure my room extension without any hassle. Very grateful for that! Very happy with the tour that Mr Wayan and Miss Sarah had arranged for me. I have had such a fantastic time! Super helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast and BBQ seafood dinner was very good.

Good internet. 💯",The Haven Bali Seminyak
136,Another great stay at the haven,50,October 2022,"This is my second time staying at the Haven, predominantly as I like the location. But I keep coming back as the staff, amenities and affordability are so good. It is also a very beautiful hotel with 2 pools and pretty well kept gardens. The staff responded to my questions promptly prior to my arrival and accomodated my request for a quiet room. After one night I decided I wanted to change rooms to be closer to the elevator and they easily arranged this for me. Maintenance was also prompt and effective to fix a door lock. This hotel is going through room rejuvination (common for all hotels), but at no time did I hear any renovation noise. The staff very much want to speak with you about any issues and are open to clients suggestions. I would highly recommend this hotel for any types of travellers.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

138,Lovely spot,30,October 2022,"Great location and friendly staff . Breakfast was adequate but a long wait for eggs as they cook them to order some days the wait was up to 25 mins and 2 days they forgot our order . We had lower ground floor room 0010 with direct pool access which was great . The only down side to that room number and any LG 009 to 0012 is it’s opposite the cleaners storage room and they come and go all day and night and have no consideration for those sleeping talking and wheeling trolleys along with their walkie talkies at full noise this went on every night all night . No room safes or clothes racks for hanging wet clothes . The clothes line in the bathroom is tiny and hangs over the toilet . Rooms are spacious with comfy bed and pillows . Bathroom is lovely . 8-10 min walk to the beach , 5 mins to Bintang supermarket. Circle K across the road . Pool is lovely with about 20 pool lounges , 2 for 1 cocktails $10 Aussie , Bintang beer $6 each .",The Haven Bali Seminyak

142,Friendly staff and great place for family with small children.,50,October 2022,We were looking for a place that was in walking distance to both the shops and the beach and booked a suite as we were travelling with our 3 year old. The room was very comfortable but it was unfortunately close to the main restaurant and road side. The hotel kindly moved us to a different suite on the back side of the hotel where also the children friendly swimmingpool was located. We really like the rooms as they are very spacious. While they need a bit of upgrading due to having been closed due to COVID the rooms are clean and the warm hospitality of the staff and elaborate breakfast make up for it.,The Haven Bali Seminyak

146,Great experience at The Haven,50,October 2022,"My fiancée and I are vacationing in Bali for a week and we just checked out of The Haven today. We checked in Monday and checked out today. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. The check-in/checkout process was simple. The entire staff is overly and genuinely friendly and helpful. They speak good English and I never had any issues with communication with anyone. The room was great. Clean and accommodating. Small gym but it will suffice. It was clean and caters to the guest. The free included breakfast was a good selection. Was a pleasurable atmosphere throughout the hotel. My fiancée’s birthday was Tuesday and I had a friend (a local) decorate our room with balloons, flowers, and a cake while my fiancée and I were out on the town during the day. I don’t know if the staff already knew it was her birthday or they saw my friend decorating but the staff also surprise us when they knocked on our door and had a small birthday cake and sang happy birthday to her!! A small gesture like this goes a long way!! It gets better. The next morning my fiancée and I come down for breakfast and a couple of the staff wish her happy birthday again!! I’m impressed that they can recognize their customers and remember names and birthdays. It’s impressive. So today we had our final free breakfast there and we had the pleasure of meeting the manager Wayan. He introduced himself to us and asked if we found everything ok or if we had any complaints so he can fix them!! We have ZERO complaints. We really loved this place. We feel really valued as a customer. Thank you Wayan and thank your your wonderful caring staff for us!! Aaron & Diyah

One last thing, we got WAY WAY more for our money at this place. I would of paid 2-3 times more for this place. It’s such a great value! Location is pretty great too!",The Haven Bali Seminyak

150,"A True ""Haven"" in Seminyak",40,October 2022,"We loved our stay here at the Haven, Seminyak.The whole staff extremely friendly and always more than helpful.

157,Booking error and quite 'buggy',20,October 2022,"We booked a 2bdr villa (fam of 5 kids 5,11,15)via The Haven Whats App with a deposit paid. We had no confirmation or follow-up prior to arrival despite making enquiries. Upon arrival (12.30am) there was no 2bdr villa avail. At 3am we were put into a 2bd suite on the 4th floor - if you'd booked it, you'd say it was fantastic, very spacious.
Next day we followed up our booking and told the Whats App reservations team is different to the hotel reservations, and wrong info sent through and we couldn't get the 2bd villa. Told we could choose the 2bd suite (4th floor and not what we booked there for) or two 1 bdr villas, but they were 30m apart - not great when travelling with kids. We still had to argue the extra bed in the villas.
While te villas themselves were very nice, spacious and look magnificent, we found them quite 'buggy', the sounds of frogs heard every night all night and the final straw was a lizard crawling from under a coffee cup.
We wouldn't stay here again - yes it looks lovely and the suite was great, but the villa though clean felt dirty.
Pools - clean but no atmosphere to get ppl into a positive vibe
Breakfast - wasn't a great range
Staff - were lovely and helpful.
Shower - water pressure - big tick",The Haven Bali Seminyak
158,Short family getaway,50,October 2022,"The hotel perfectly located and easy for traveller with car because it has basement car parking.

159,Lovely family suites,40,October 2022,"Was lovely property.
We stayed at the 2bedroom apartments.
Staff were VERY RESPECTFUL and helpful ..especially Ms Endang a breakfest host , the egg station cooks were very accommodating.
Spa massage was lovely and relaxing .
Transport Station at front reception Mr Ketut was an absolute pleasure, was like taking a drive with your dad a friendly local..truly need to have as your driver to anywhere , very punctual and a true original Transport driver ..I tipped well and was told too much but ketut deserved very cent 🙏.
Overall a lovely stay checked in was 3pm however room wasn't available till 4.30pm..due to shortage of staff and an increase of returning travel back to Bali.
Would of liked a quick explanation of the room , phone service , room service you need to scan a bar code to retrieve menu, had no idea how ..little things to some but I like a quick walk through .
It's a long property and can excit back of hotel onto a lane way that leads to a main road full of restaurants and shopping .
Was quite and easy access.
Overall with a bit of an upgrade in furniture this would be a 4star it's states .
Thankyou all Haven Staff , you were all lovely .
Even the wonderful guitar player who let me sing along with him on a beautiful balmy night at front restaurant.
Beautiful memories made .
Namaste 🙏",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Had a very comfortable stay and accomodating and friendly staff.
Breakfast had all u need, asian and western.
Only the jams were not to my liking, but that's very specific. I have no complaints about any of the other items I've tried.
There's a scooter rental next door, a K-Mart with ATM directly across and the beach is a 15mins walk away.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

My advice is for the buffet breakfast menu. Not quite good, many improvement is required.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
167,Great place for families but non existent service from front desk with fixing internet issue over 7 days.,40,October 2022,"Really enjoyed the resort. It was ideal for us as a family of three and centrally located to everything we needed allowing us to walk rather than catching taxi/drivers.
The restaurant staff were exceptionally nice and very helpful. Desi who worked there was an asset to the resort.
The only issue we had that never got resolved even though we called the front desk everyday was our internet not working in room 201/202. We never did get it working and nobody came to assist us which was very disappointing as we felt very unvalued as customers.
Other than that small issue it was a great place to stay and I’d recommend in future.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

170,Good value for 1 bedroom suite,30,August 2022,"! bedroom suites are a great value for a huge room. Rooms are becoming outdated but are still very comfortable and everything works. The breakfast has been downsized and moved indoors but is adequate. Location is convenient to walk to shopping, some good restaurants and the beach. Construction along the beach walking area is making the area dusty and noisy during the daytime. This was our 5th stay over the years and it has changed, but remains a good choice, more so for families.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
171,"Great location, clean and friendly",40,September 2022,"Excellent for the price. Great location. Friendly staff. Breakfast ok for price. Showers a bit temperamental. 2 bedroom pool Villa very big. Pool a bit cold, but clean and refreshing. Definitely value for money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
172,Beautiful location and awesome staff,50,September 2022,"My family stayed here for 4 days while we stopped in Seminyak, Bali on our trip around Indonesia. Our room was fantastic. It was clean, quiet and huge! We had balconies overlooking the pool and two day beds... one for the kids and one for my wife and I. These were seperated and private enough to allow us some couple time away, but not too far, from the kids.
The staff are amazing and always friendly and helpful. One day, our taxi dropped us off to the wrong Haven. We found out there are more than one! The staff at the Haven Berawa recognised our confusion and immediately came to our assistance, organised a new taxi, with the correct destination and even gave us refreshments while we waited. Great service for tired, confused travellers who were not even staying at that particular Haven!
The breakfasts are banquets, it is a short walk to the beach for the sunsets and restaurants galore nearby.
I would love to come back and would definitely recommend.

Thanks for the lovely stay Haven, Seminyak! and thanks Haven Berawa for being so helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

We were gobsmacked at the size of the Villa upon arrival, the layout is fantastic allowing everyone their own space. The dining and kitchen area is such a bonus, particularly to stock water, Bintang (haha) in a full-size fridge! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, and the location is ideal to walk pretty much anywhere! The breakfast buffet is awesome with abundant choices with both western and local cuisine, the pancakes were a bit hit with our kids! The property never felt crowded or busy, with 4 pools ther is room for everyone. This was a ""true""holiday, and so reasonably priced, we are already planning our next stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
175,Not what I expected,20,September 2022,"I chose to stay at the haven Seminyak due to all the amazing reviews, however I felt rather disappointed with the place- which was a shame.
Good location and clean rooms however- they are renovating and placed us in a room right above it so was woken too sounds of tools and drilling all day. There is also very loud music until 12am which usually wouldn’t bother me, but I couldn’t sleep in due to renovations.
We are a young couple on our first over seas trip and the room had no view at all :( just a balcony infront of a wall. which was a bummer.

Nice location though.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
176,Good experience,50,September 2022,"Good hotel, good environment, very nice staff.
Affordable price with premium service quality.
Located at strategic area on bali.

The room with good amenities and good cleanliness.

Professional staff hotel and very helpful.
Mba Sarah as a reception staff very helpful.

Recommended hotel for solo tripper",The Haven Bali Seminyak
177,Special occasion booking,50,September 2022,"I planned a romantic dinner at a villa with the staff and we were totally blown away with the evening. The staff were amazing and made sure everything was perfect, with special touch’s that just made it all the more enjoyable! Couldn’t fault their service and effort, thank you 😊",The Haven Bali Seminyak
178,Never Again,10,September 2022,"Sorry to again write a review but this hotel is just not listening. Again the noise from renovations below our room is unbearable. These are NO signs at reception or any other place letting you know. An email to advise this was happening would have at least given us prior warning, as many other guests have also stated. So sorry from reception just doesn’t cut it. We have spoken with many guests who have also complained about things. 3 days to get 2 wine glasses, your joking. No use putting the “Make up my room “ sign on the door it just doesn’t happen. No pool service!!! As I’m slightly disabled and not lazy as some may have thought , it’s not easy for me to get around. Not once did a staff member ask if we wanted drinks or food. Something else they’ll miss out on. As these rooms being renovated are by the pool there is NO escape even there from the endless grinding and drilling. They have offered to move us AGAIN later tonight , but it makes no sense doing this on our last night. Forget the afternoon snooze it’s just no going to happen. I hope that the hotel manager will call us as they have to this time made no attempt. I trust that other travelers take heed of this. The only way we can let them know is to NEVER book again. We usually stay at the hotel next door but we like to give other hotels a chance. This was our mistake Booking here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
179,Recommend suite,50,September 2022,"We enjoyed our holiday at The Haven, we booked a one bedroom pool suite at the back of the hotel which was great, huge balcony with daybed.

Would go back and highly recommend.🙏",The Haven Bali Seminyak
180,Not what we ordered,30,September 2022,"Booked a twin room at this hotel last October 2021 for the first time. When we arrived at the room it was NOT a twin, so had to spend the first few nights sleeping with my sister. They eventually changed rooms. Had to throw out the food in the fridge as it was now hot. Milk, yogurt etc. spoiled. There were some rooms being refurbished below our room. We woke at 6am to The noise of tap tap tapping of chisels and drills.
Unfortunately we will not be back to this hotel. We are planning another trip for our entire family of 13 next March, we will be selecting somewhere else.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Woohoyy!!

Although minor defects but the staff was handful and remediate superfast.
The hotel also has suites and villas. Beach is only 5 minutes walk.

This time i stayed in Studio Suit, the room is very clean, spacious and comfortable. There are 2 aircon working so well, i used 1 since its too cold, so i got more then i need. All the stuff is amazingly friendly and helpful event the GM Pak Wayan Suka from time to time walk around and asking guests if they feel comfortable and if anything else they can assist. For my breakfast, I had choices more than i need on the breakfast buffet and the stuff especially Endang so friendly and helpful. I dont feel alone on my solo travel. The location is just the perfect location, in the center of everything yet inside the hotel was very quite and spacious with beautiful maintained landscape.
Pandemic has been blowing hard on tourism business, i can understand if some of sanitary showing their age but nevertheless i saw the hotel refurbish their facility. I had water liking from the faucet basin but the technician immediately come and fix it after i called the front desk. Nothing i can complain only compliment.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

On arrival we were advised that our rooms were not ready we had booked months in advance, after waiting an hour our daughter and her partner were given their room keys .my wife and I waited two and a half hours for our room .upon entry we had noticed one of the bed side lights was drooping and held together with tape paint peeling around the bathroom taps and black mold in the shower. In the following days we noticed the noise in the Haven is very loud even on the first floor. The phone was not working and then the air-conditioning broke down and on several occasions the room was not made up and we had to ask.The breakfast is ok and the staff freindly .Desi in the dinning room is fantastic the best part of the Haven still in the Haven for another 2 nights .we asked for a late check out and for all the inconvenience but the manager said no and we would have to pay $50 Australia obviously I have",The Haven Bali Seminyak

They were very attentive when I got Bali belly, to make sure I was always well hydrated. We will be back and be bringing more of our friends and family.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
192,Disappointed,30,July 2022,I have stayed at The Haven many times over a 8 years but also have stayed at other hotels aswell when in Bali more so as The Haven suites and service has slipped so much year after year..as it has been over 2 5 years since I was last there and covid..I stayed at The Courtyard Marriott first which was really nice..then I booked a 1 bedroom villa at The Haven..the villa looks fantastic but function wise is not practical..the bedroom is difficult to sleep as the room does not have black out curtains so when the sun rises the room is light and of course I wake up due to the early light...the other problem is the villa is so large there are only 2 small air conditioners in the room so tho room does not get cool enough have to sleep with sheet off because not cool enough..also in the bathroom is only 1 airconditoner and same that part of the villa is also warm...thrme biggest shock for me was the buffet breakfast....there are 2 things that I like about The Haven the friendly staff and the fantastic buffet breakfast ..but the buffet break is not fantastic anymore..limited choice now really cutting back with the breakfast use to have so much hot food to choose from and alot of sweets like doughnuts ect use to have a good choice of at least 3 juices not anymore..also a suite or villa customer we use to have breakfast in the back quite area of the hotel not anymore now suite and villa customers sit in the front with everyone else..I notice that they look like they are starting to refurbished the tired rooms..this is 1 of the reasons I have not been coming because like most reviews the rooms were old and dated air con also old not working properly..so fingers crossed the owner might be spending some money to update this hotel but please bring back the fantastic buffet breakfast you use to have.. I did book again in November but now cancelled..I will book at 1 of the other hotels for similar price with better rooms and modern cons,The Haven Bali Seminyak
193,Bali Trip,50,August 2022,"We stayed at the Haven, booked the Villa suite because it had a small pool. Turns out it had 2 private pools and the bedroom and en-suite was as big as a 2 bedroom house!!! Amazing staff and the food. Ask for Villa 603…. It’s awesome",The Haven Bali Seminyak
194,Disgusting! Check your toilet washer sprayer head.,10,July 2022,"Disgusting! Check your toilet Washer! To have a toilet Washer is good, but the hotel didn't clean the sprayer head at all. Faeces from other guests are everywhere. We complained about it in the morning but must return to complain again because it was not even cleaned properly. We have an automatic cleaning washer in Amsterdam, even though we must clean it twice a week.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
195,Our best stay,40,July 2022,"The room was so nice we got it at such a good deal, the receptionist Mbok Wulan was very attentive and kind we loved our stay. The breakfast restaurant is pretty small and packed so we suggest u to get breakfast earlier in the morning",The Haven Bali Seminyak
196,Value Hotel,40,July 2022,"I booked this hotel on many recommendations on booking sites and good deals. Overall the hotel is clean, nice, friendly staff and reasonable location.
On the first night i was placed in a ground floor room next to the pool. I would not recommend these rooms. The balcony leads to a busy walkway where hotel guests to the other wing seem to constantly be walking. Also at 7am a noisy family decided to use the pool right outside my room.
I was moved to the second floor the next night which was much better and would recommend asking for high floor when booking.
The quality of the breakfast was average at best and I ended up going to The Brunch Club cafe down the road for breakfast which was incredible so I would recommend that instead.
Overall I enjoyed my stay and would recommend if you wan’t something nice on a budget only.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
197,Welcome back after 2.5 years of COVID,40,June 2022,"Check in was easy..
We booked the 1 bedroom suite, nice and huge! 2 outside day beds, nice n roomy inside.

We had a 7 day stay, yet room wasn’t made up one day, odd, so we had to call for towels and toilet paper, they said no staff…we were in the room 2X during our stay when it was cleaned and they all did a good job, even dry moped the floor, changed pillow slips, dusted down the front 2 balconies with a big mop sweeper.

Breakfast was adequate, from 8:30am it got BUSY. Had an egg station, poor guy was flat out!
No smoking in the breakfast area, only vaping allowed, go figure!!

Our room had 2 air cons, we just left the lounge/kitchen area one on and not the bedroom, it did the job.

Bathroom, well that’s a bit of a dangerous sport clambering in and out of the shower/bath, you have to be stable on your feet! You basically need to be able to lift your leg as high as your hip to get in…
There is no shower hose, just a big rain head.

It also is a spa.

Turns out the mixer was broken, like literally comes off in your hand, so no matter what we only had half power of water in the shower head due to the bath nozzle running at the same time.

4 pools, not a great amount of sun lounges, there are also couples sun lounges.

The Haven complex is very long so depending where your room is, it could be a walk and a half. There is a back exit that leads to a small street and brings you out on double 6, 8min walk to beach.

3min walk to Bintang supermarket that re opened June 26th, 2022.

24hr chemist across the road

A few dinner choices near by, short taxi ride to Seminyak and Legian.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
198,A haven of peace,50,May 2022,"This is not the first time we have stayed at The Haven but the fourth. Why? Not too complicated, the warm welcome, you feel at home, the cleanliness of the place, the idyllic setting and of course you eat well.

We will keep etching in our memories the smiles and kindness of Pradita, Ayu, Dharma, Bagus, Sara, Putra, Desi, Eka, Reza, Agus & all this beautiful family. We look forward to seeing you again.

Thankyou to everyone at the haven for making our stay there enjoyable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
202,Disappointed to say the least,10,May 2022,Stayed at the Haven 2 years ago. Decided to stay again this trip. Changed room 3 times due to absolutely NO hot water!!! Worked out Hotel must have been turning off hot water to save money. Each day hot water from 2.00 pm for half an hour then cold again. No creamer for coffee cleaners were hot & Miss cleaning of rooms. Never had a mop put on the floor in 10 days! Changed sheets once! Breakfast was a let down catered more for Indonesian/ Asian guests. Toast available without butter. Most staff had a problem with their English. Hotel allowed Transport drivers to stand in the Lobby of hotel who hounded you every time we entered or left the Hotel. One driver was extremely rude. Not a good look on the Hotel!!!! Sorry The Haven Hotel I will never return to stay again at the property. Originally booked a 1 bedroom suite room down graded to pool access room. Due to no hot water in both rooms asked for a refund Hotel said they could change our room. They tried to put us in a small room overlooking the roof of the hotel!!! I said I wanted a refund as we had enough. They then said we could have a junior suite still no hot water!!! After me letting acting manager of hotel know that the hotel was cutting off power to hot water we instantly had hot water!!! Poor treatment of hotel customers would not recommend to anyone. What once was a good Hotel is NO longer,The Haven Bali Seminyak
203,Good suite for family,50,May 2022,"Had 3 night stay in 2 bedroom suite with my family, a great hotel i stay for my birthday close to the beach and mini market. The staff was so nice and helpful, only one part of the receptionist and security is less friendly and seems condescending. The rest were all very good and helpful when I needed something, the wifi seemed to have to be maintained because as long as I was there it couldn't be used. I will back soon with my family.....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
204,I would definitely return .,50,May 2022,"First time staying here but not my last . The rooms were clean and welcoming . Bar fridge , tea / coffee facilities ( they could add some milk to that ) hair dryer , good air conditioning and very comfortable bed and pillows . I. can’t sleep with big fat hard pillows ( neck ache ) and the pillows I had were perfect .
The grounds are well looked after , location is central to everything .
And the best of all is the staff . From the cleaning staff to front office to grounds people to the restaurant to the security out front. Desi , you were brilliant - thank you . And all the staff were friendly and helpful.
The only thing I would suggest - if you are a light sleeper ask for a room towards the back due to the music at night time . I personally didn’t have an issue with it , but I heard someone else comment how they found it difficult to sleep .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
205,Do not stay here! Rooms are dirty! Service takes forever!,10,May 2022,"Please stay away from this place if you’re looking for a a clean and efficient service. We initially stayed for 2 days in a private pool villa before ubud and 1 night at Pool View Suites before fluting back home. On both separate occasions, the check in took so long. Even if you check in after 4 pm, they make you wait in the lobby for almost half an hour with an excuse that the housekeeping is still checking everything. The worst of it all, when you arrive in your room…the ROOMS ARE DIRTY!!!!! Both private pool villa and suites were dirty. DO NOT STAY ON SUITE 104. Moldy smell and weird stench in the whole room. The shower has rusty bath tub and the sink has molds. DISGUSTING!!! We booked our stay ahead through Agoda and both were refundable. I wish I read the reviews first, the bad reviews before covid and now after covid it’s even worse.

Stay away from this place! Bad service and dirty rooms!!! There are a lot better hotels around we wished we stayed at.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
206,Would not recommend,20,May 2022,"The Room
On our first night we had a problem with our night light, that when we switched it off, it would turn on the main light. We tried calling reception four times to fix this issue, to which we received no answer, or were hung up on. The safety box also did not work. The next day we went down to report our issues, they fixed the safety box immediately, however said that they would fix the lights whilst we were out of the room. At 8 o’clock that night, it still hadn’t been fixed, and again we had to go down to reception to ask them to fix it. The next day, with our belongings inside, the safety box broke. We called reception, who said they would come up to fix it. We waited half an hour before calling again, to which someone finally came up. We then used the safety deposit box again later that day, upon returning to the room it had broken again. We called reception again, who said they would send someone up to fix it. No one came up and we had to wait for the next day, again, to get it fixed. The coffee was also not replenished each morning in the room. I would also like to mention that the rooms are not sound proof. We were on the top floor and could hear everything in the corridors, at the poolside and outside.
Breakfast
I believe that the breakfast was catered more towards travelers than paying guests. We spoke to the manager who said that they were trying to make the breakfast as affordable as possible, explaining the lack of options. Extras such as three slices of bacon had an extra charge of 20K rupias. I would not expect this from a 4* hotel. Especially when we had booked the hotel online and once arriving to the hotel, they told us the rate had increased (although we had booked and had an email confirmation with the first price?). Why are they prioritizing attracting customers to a cheap breakfast than guests that are paying for a 4* hotel/service?",The Haven Bali Seminyak
207,Bad experecience,20,May 2022,"Honestly, very bad management about this hotel.
All things not working well, bathroom in the suit is very horrible, breakfast area is full and you can not found a good food because 9 am is finnished.
The reception is not efficient.some service is good",The Haven Bali Seminyak
208,Nice hotel with friendly and attentive staff,50,May 2022,"I arrived at the Haven in April and left early May. It was great to be be able to travel again.
The Haven is my preferred hotel when in Seminyak, having stayed here quite a few times now, I booked the Haven Premiere Pool View with Balcony. The room was very clean & suited my needs. Rooms are serviced daily.
The staff are all so friendly, everyone made me feel welcome, special mention to Pardita in the evening in the restaurant.
I started most mornings with a walk, returned to have breakfast at the front restaurant & then sat by the pool reading & having a swim for most of the morning.
Great spot, lots to offer, little or no noise most nights & very central in Seminyak.
One my final night, live music was back, so really pleasing to see things moving again after covid-19.
I like how this hotel takes the opportunity to train new staff and gives people a go.
See you all again in August when I return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
209,Home away from home,30,April 2022,"The Haven is still a quiet oasis in the heart of Seminyak - most of the guests are domestic - hence the breakfast is held in the front restaurant and Indonesian fare to cater for the majority of guests.
A note to management - we feel they need to manage the standards carefully by asking guests to wear day clothes to the restaurant - rather than pyjamas and not to allow guests to hang their underwear etc on the balconies and leave their rubbish and cigarette butts outisde their rooms. TV reception not that great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
210,Location wise it's convenient,40,April 2022,"I've booked pool view room. Averagely clean. Room is enough for 2 with baggages and 1 cabin size luggage. Air conditioning is doing well

212,Good to be back again!,50,April 2022,"Good to be back again!
Recently I did stay at the Haven 2 times 23 - 26 March and 2 - 5 April. After more then 2 years the Haven managed to maintain their excellent service and hospitality.
They make good progress with the renovation of the rooms. The new rooms have the same size. The wooden floors and the new decorations make the Haven ready for the future.
The breakfast still only has little selection of the big buffet they had before. I am sure when more tourists start to come back, the big breakfast buffet at Sabeen will be back too. For now it is sufficient and there is still enough options too choose from.
The front office is efficiently operated as usual. The staff is very friendly and do anything to make the guest feel home. I like to thank Whulan for her service with a smile who handled check out on 26 March and 5 of April very well.
I can recommend anyone to stay at the haven. The hotel is ready to receive guests like the did in the past. I am already looking forward to stay with them again in November.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
213,Had a fantastic time,50,April 2022,"A return guest who have stayed in almost all of their room type. From suite, 1 bedroom villa n my last stayed was in 2 bedrooms villa with my family. My last stayed was almost 4weeks so I kinda know some of the staff name lol. The reception who named WULAN was very nice n helpful from checking me in n help me thru the process. She always very friendly n polite everytime I saw her. The hotel is beautiful as it has a tropical set up n few different pools, for kids n adults. The villa obviously have their own private pool n it's in decent size pool. The on suite bathroom / bath tub is massive n so spacious, very good for family stay or long stay. The entire building is clean, neat, and the staff is amazing!! Even the housekeeping who named Made were very good too n sport on! He done such a good job in cleaning my room every single time. I definitely recommend this property for ur short stay, long stay or family group stay. They well deserve some rating 👍🏼. There's no doubt that I'll come back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
214,Chic hotel,40,April 2021,"During my first trip to Bali, I chose stay in this hotel based on reviews and photos. Upon arrival, the hotel staff were friendly and welcoming. Though our arrival was too early for lunch, they extended their breakfast time to accommodate us. The room was clean and spacious just beside the pool area. The seafood dinner was also good with a small band playing relaxing music. The location is perfect as it is near shops and restaurants and the Seminyak beach which is clean. All in all, our experience was very satisfactory.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

217,Poor condition and breakfast,20,October 2021,"It's 3 years since I last stayed in the Haven, my recollection was then it was a clean property well located near Jl double six and fairly priced. Unfortunately since that time the condition of the rooms has noticeably deteriorated. For our 2 night stay the premium room condition was shabby. The evening we arrived we noticed mosquitoes in the room so asked for the room to be sprayed, this was done promptly by housekeeping however when we returned from dinner 2 hrs later, while the mosquitoes were gone we found 5 large dead cockroaches on the floor. Next morning the standard and the quality of the breakfast it was clear had also gone down so much so that despite the room rate including breakfast we ate breakfast at another hotel on the second morning before leaving. The property management needs to step up performance on cleanliness and breakfast service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
218,Maximum service during pandemic,50,October 2021,"Stay here during pandemic, and they provide the best rate they can, and of course the best service as well. We get what we pay and it's super worth it! Only 10 mins walk from double six beach as well. Good location.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Nice place to have me time for myself, the room is quite, clean, all the staff very nice and friendly. The location is very strategic, only 5 minutes by walking to Double Six beach. It was a lovely stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
224,Excellent villa and excellent service,50,February 2021,"I often stay at The Haven Seminyak Bali for my business and leisure trips. But this time (due of the pandemic) we got an extraordinary offer to stay at the two-bedroom villa. The villa is marvelous, very-well-designed, with two private pools (yes, at first I can’t imagine: two private pools for a villa, so you should try this luxurious treat for yourself 😁), clean, and well-kept. The five of us (we have three teenage daughters) are satisfied and have a very nice stay there.
The staffs are friendly and the services are excellent. We also rent the car from them, the car is a brand new MPV and the driver is polite and knowledgable.
We will be back for the next holiday in Bali!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
225,Upgraded Room to Suite,40,December 2020,"We booked for 3 delure rooms with pool view last December 2020. WHen we arrived, the rooms were not ready so we had to wait for about 15-20 minutes. surprisingly, they upgraded our room to suite (2 room + living room) and the other room is on different floor. I did not see my friend's room, but she said the AC was not really working.
My room was nice and clean. But we had to ask for bath towel since they were not available in the bathroom. For a suite room with induction stove, there were no kitchen utensils. I don't know, we should have asked if they provided them separately.
Breakfast was only 2 options. at first I tried American and it was ok. but when I tried their Nasi Goreng for breakfast in the next day, it was cold.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
226,Strategic location but too noisy,30,December 2020,"(+) Nearby to minimarket, only 7 mins to Double Six beach by walking
(+) Room & bathroom is nice enough, only the floor is a bit dirty
(+) Breakfast was not bad. We have to choose between Indonesian/American bfast but the beverages are self pick up. The food is quite good.

(-) We had to wait for more than 1.5 hours for the room to be ready. Had to ask the receptionists for 3 times until they finally approached us and brought us to the room.
(-) Room with pool view is good but way too noisy especially in the early morning you can hear kids shouting in the pool. Not recommended for someone who look for quietness.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
227,Maybe 3 star at a push,20,May 2019,"I honestly don't understand the good reviews on here. It's one of the worst hotels I've stayed in. The bathroom was mouldy and dated, the bath is so deep and shower is over the bath so really dangerous getting in and out of shower. The airconditioning hardly works and was noisy plus dripped from the ceiling on to my luggage.

The floors are marked, the benchtops are porous and marked.

The bedding was comfortable and the second pool area is lovely but where are the staff?? No drink / food service by the pool.

Breakfast is average, tea was always lukewarm.

Check in was horrendous, wasn't offered a seat or a drink on arrival, rude staff more interested in talking to each other.

I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
228,Great hotel in the middle of everything,50,March 2020,"We stayed at the Haven for 8 nights 13-21 march 2020. Yes at the start of the Cov19 shutdown. We travelled to Bali for our 10th wedding anniversary and when we arrived we had to wait a couple of hours for our room but we went to the bar and enjoyed a few bevvys and some lunch very nice.
When we got to our room they had decorated it with towel swans and rose petals on the bed and in the bath. A very nice surprise.
We had a wonderful room a 1 Bedroom Suite (room 704), the size of the suite was amazing and the design was very spacious and comfortable.
Kitchen
It had a small kitchen with a cooktop, sink, fridge with freezer and plenty of bench space, cooking utensils, cutleyand a dinner set. Complimentary teas and coffee.. Table and chairs for 4.
Lounge
The lounge area was very comfortable with a sofa bed, 2 amp chairs and coffee table. TV, stereo and Phone.
Bedroom
Large King bed very comfortable and nice linen. 2nd TV in the room with lots of bench space., side tables attached to wall with power outlets and bedside lamps both sides.
Storage
Cupboard space sufficient, safe and plenty of hanging space and cupboards for clothes(no Draws). Space for 1 large piece of luggage but we put the other luggage under the bench where the TV was plent of room there.
Bathroom
Bath with shower, had to step into the bath to have a shower not the best when I have a sore knee but managed. Toilet,basin and all the toiletries you would need.
Soft towels and changed daily.
Balcony
We had a groung floor suite as requested and we had 2 balconies overlooking the pool. Both the lounge area and bedroom had a large opening sliding door leading out to the balcony, each balcony had a daybed.
Overall the room was fabulous. More than I expected.
Breakfast
Buffet style with an egg station, bacon, Cereals, juices, pastries, fruit etc etc.All good. Plenty of seating.
Restaurant
Very nice food the Satay was especially good and value for money. We attended the BBQ night and there was plenty of food to choose from and very fresh seafood and salads. No booking was required but it was a little quite as most of the hotel guests had left due to border shutdowns in several countries.
Bar
Both the bar at the pool and the mail bare at the front were good, cocktail prices were 2 for 1 about 180,000 Rp for 2, not too bad for hotel prices. The beer was also cold and 2 for 1, 100.000Rp for 2.
Staff
The staff (all of them) were friendly and always smiling. I particularly would like to thank the house keeping and restaurant staff for making our holiday great. I would like to single out one in particular Pardita (Lambo) he was a lovely man and very helpful.
Would I stay at the Haven again YES I would thank you again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
229,Family Holiday,40,February 2020,"Lovely staff, great food, massages & drinks. Very clean & good location. Appeals to all age groups. Suited us not to have lots of small children there too. Very easy to go to shops & restaurants & malls. Easy to grab a tour from there for a great day out.
Thoroughly recommend",The Haven Bali Seminyak
230,Just ok,30,December 2019,"The location was good, right in the centre of Seminyak, walking distance to many places including the beach. Breakfast at the restaurant was good too.
However, the service need improvement. It took almost an hour to get check in, room was not available, had to take another room. Initially, the aircon was not working properly, had to be fixed.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
231,"lovely staff,but a bit noisy",30,March 2020,"I have previously stayed at the Haven 8 years ago ( on a company trip) and decided that for my wedding anniversary that it would be nice to return with my wife and relax.
We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was situated towards the rear of the property.It was a very large and comfortable room with a main bedroom with ensuite and a lounge room with kitchenette.we also had an excellent balcony with daybed overlooking a pool.
Our room was north side of the complex near the breakfast facilities.
Breakfast is a buffet type arrangement and you eat next to one of the many pools.
The food for breakfast was good and the staff outstanding.
The Haven is pretty much on a very busy street and I found that the rear laneway was a shortcut to shops in a side street, not big shops but just touristy type offerings ,bars and food.
The Haven runs a regular golf cart type service down to the
beach which I would guess is a 5 to 10 minute walk depending on your fitness.
Overall the staff are outstanding but the big downfall of this hotel is that it has hotels each side of it with carparks under the buildings
The noise from some of these is at times ridiculous,with noisy motorbikes revving through the carpark as if they are on a racetrack.
It echos straight from the carpark and into the haven's corridors
Really you would think that the owners of these buildings would get together to curtail
the bikes from interupting peoples sleep .
After all ...tourism is why these places exist.
I really like the Haven but some of the noise got to me as the pools are between the two blocks of buildings. An afternoon nap with screaming kids was sometimes impossible.....Perhaps I am getting too old for this place ...next time I will leave it to the young families with kids and find a nice quiet place in Phuket",The Haven Bali Seminyak
232,Just relax,50,March 2020,Haven so easy access to shop massage and walkin distance to the beach i love the location i came to Haven first time my flight was so early in the morning reach Bali at 9.30am i stayed at the airport had some breasfast before heading yo Haven was welcome by front office staff at the front of the hotel and check in by ur always smile staff name Sarah she very helpful my room was not ready so i go walk around came back room is ready beautiful room 2018 4 days at Haven is not enough i can only say thank you so much Haven make me feel welcome. Alao the food at the restaurant was awesome i remmeber order Salmon pasta fir dinner is was delicious.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
233,Daily Breakfasts Excellent,50,March 2020,"The Haven Bali is a open plan breakfast/smorgasbord, (huge variety) the Cost is around $12.00AU very good value, fresh food in a clean environment you receive endless full breakfast + drinks/coffee (fresh made coffee - flat white etc)
If you eat at a cafes you actually pay more and get a lot less, and the food at the Haven is better quality and fresh",The Haven Bali Seminyak
234,Value for money,40,March 2020,"My husband and I were staying at the Haven for the first time for 11 nights. We were picked up by Ade who was fantastic and was filling us in on everything about the hotel and what it had to offer. As requested, our room was next to the pool but right outside the pool bar which was rather noisey. We requested if we could be moved to another room by the pool which the staff happily did. Unfortunately the next room had a very strong musty smell and on closer inspection there was mould on the walls and the fridge leaked. On contacting the staff they were fantastic and moved us to a room on the 3rd floor which was perfect for the rest of our stay. Sadly though we had to cut our holiday short due to Coronavirus and flights looking like they were going to be cut. I thought that The Haven was great value for money although the rooms are tired and could do with a refresh. The pool is a relaxing place to hangout or refresh after a day shopping. The staff were all fantastic and helpful which included giving us a free transfer to the airport on our departure and also refunding 2 nights accommodation which they weren't obliged to do. It is right in the centre of great shopping and places to eat.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
235,Five Star Visit! Amazing Service!,50,March 2020,"My husband and I stayed at the Haven Seminyak for ten days, and were continuously impressed. Very clean. Food was fantastic! Breakfast buffet was delicious and plenty of healthy selections. Staff extraordinarily helpful and kind - they always went out of their way to anticipate and serve our needs. The peak experience was when staff member Erna sleuthed a humming noise that disturbed my morning meditation. She stayed on it, calling the manager and maintenance staff to come listen, finally located the sound of an exhaust fan on the floor above. They turned it off and we were never disturbed again. This kind of rare service is greatly appreciated. In short, we enthusiastically recommend this hotel to others.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
236,Delightful!,50,March 2020,"Staying here at The Haven again and the value for money is extraordinarily good! We are in a two room suite at the back of the hotel and it’s beautifully quiet.

The staff are just lovely! My daughter slipped in the bedroom and required stitches to her head and they were sincerely worried - kept saying anything she needs at any time, please just tell us.

Sure, there are some tiles with cracks but it’s a fairly old hotel so it’s to be expected, but the rooms are very clean and well maintained as are the beautiful grounds.

I’m a fairly fussy traveller but The Haven satisfies me in every way!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
237,Great Value for Money,40,February 2020,"I have stayed numerous times at the Haven and still find it great value. We like the Villa, which for the money is of an excellent standard.
Is it 5 star? No but the price reflects this.
Villa's are clean spacious and have a huge bathroom with the no touch toilets which are good especially in these times.
Lighting in bathroom is still a problem for me, which could be fixed with a magnifying mirror. I think they really need to add coffee machines to the rooms as a coffee lover the instant variety doesn't do it for me.
Rooms were lovely and cool.
I feel that in some areas of resort it is starting to look tired and needs to be renovated but I will still come back because it is in an ideal location and staff were all good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
238,Well Positioned,40,March 2020,"Good overall stay in this centrally located hotel
rooms suites and villas around the several pools allowing choice of price ranges and standards
Buffet breakfast can be busy but is extensive
Themed evening meals at reasonable prices
Staff are very welcoming and all in all v good value for the price charged on a Jetstar package",The Haven Bali Seminyak
239,Would return to The Haven.,40,February 2020,"Stayed at the Haven for 10 days definitely worth the money considering how good our deal was. I would stay there again. Couple of nights it got noisey cause of other guests and cause of the street. Next time would ask for a room down the back. House keeping were fantastic, always came home to a clean room, room was fantastic considering the price. Buffet average but can’t complain about the price yet again. Drinks and food average with tax and service.Staff were great, found the trainees are fantastic.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
240,First Time in Bali,40,February 2020,"The check in service was very quick and efficient.
Our room was smaller than I expected. I was a bit disappointed with the shower & bath. Perhaps it needs to be upgraded.
What I like best about our stay at the Haven Bali is having lunch and dinner at Haven's Restaurant (Sabeen). The staff were awesome: Desi, Taufiq and a few others who I did not manage to write down their names. The all you can buffet dinner is good value for money. If you love cocktails, you'll love the buy 1 get 1 free specials.Also the buffet breakfast was great: love the watermelon and Pawpaw.
The location is good - short taxi rides to Discovery Mall and Beachwalk Shopping Mall if you like shopping. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at The Haven Bali Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
241,"Ok, but a bit to be desired.",30,March 2020,"When i booked thru a travel agent, there was no issue. We arrived at the hotel and were told they had double booked our room, so had to take a double villa, but they locked the second bedroom. Ok, we only need one room i suppose.

We told them it was our honeymoon when booking, and we were told we would recieve a few perks. We recieved nothing. Then they told us they had recieved no indication that we were on our honeymoon, only 30 seconds earlier agreeing that they actually had gotten notice.

On top of that, the hot water tap was not connected in the bath. We told them about it and we were told it would be looked at. Nobody came to fix it. We told them again, and someone came to fix it straight away, basically proving that nobody had looked at it in the first place.

The people are lovely, but as a whole, the service and accommodations need improving.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
242,People stay here again and again,50,March 2020,"This was our third stay here, and talking to guests around the pool allot of people keep coming back for good reason. Staff are very friendly and helpful, Wulan especially looked after us and made us feel welcome and checked in to make sure we were satisfied. Our suite was spacious and very clean, have stayed in other rooms and just as good. Two great pool areas surrounded by beautiful gardens and burger/ hot dog stand a must try. We had buffet breakfast every day and went to a few diners, all food was excellent with wide variety and plenty of it. Great location, wi fi worked very well everywhere in the resort, good air conditioning and comfortable beds/ pillows.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
243,Reasonable stay,40,February 2020,"My partner and I stayed in a hotel room at ""The Haven"" for 7 nights. The check-in process was prompt. The staff are very friendly and attentive. As many other reviewers have mentioned the hotel could indeed do with an upgrade. Cleanliness of the room could also be improved. Lots of marks on walls and grime in the bathrooms which could easily be removed. Air-conditioning worked reasonably well but was a little noisy. We requested a quiet room at the rear-end of the hotel so did not suffer at all from any outside noise as described by previous travellers. Breakfast was of reasonable standard. There are two restaurants - ""Sabeen"" at the front of the hotel and ""Lemon Cello"" at the rear-end of the hotel. Regardless of whether you might stay in a suite, villa or hotel room you can choose to have breakfast at either. The Lemon Cello restaurant has a much nicer setting and offers the same breakfast as the other restaurant. There are also two pools - again you can choose to go to either. We found the pools lovely although my partner informed me that he did find some rats nests alongside one of the pools. We personally did not utilise the Spa or gym. Something that did bother us was being harassed by taxi drivers inside the hotel. A hotel should be a safe place where you can come to peace without being pestered. All in all a lovely stay with some minor improvements that could be made.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
244,Lovely Hotel,50,February 2020,"We stayed here for 5 nights the hotel is lovely. On check in we were told they didnt have a double room but as I booked it in October and had paid in advance I insisted we had the room we had specified. This was only a minor hiccup and was sorted within 15 mins. The staff are so lovely at this hotel. It is very clean. Both restaurants are nice and I had a massage in the spa which is obviously more than the ones on the street but for convenience this was better for us. Will return if we come back to bali and would recommend to family and friends. Thank you for having us
Mr and Mrs Patel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
245,One Bedroom Haven Pool Villa,50,February 2020,"I was upgraded to a One Bedroom Haven Pool Villa as they had run out of the rooms I had booked. It was simply outstanding - private pool, queen bed with canopy, spa, kitchen, separate lounge. It was very private and away from the noise and hecticness of Bali.

I couldn't have been happier with the quality of the room and the resort.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. Room service was very quick.

Top marks from me.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
246,A bit disappointing,30,February 2020,"We always have stayed in this area and this time needed one nights accommodation so decided to stay here as we have early flight out in morning and always thought it looked a lovely place. Staff are super friendly and room is nice, aircon and pool very refreshing. I am sitting awake at 1:50 am as the music from across the road has kept me and my husband awake most of night. Traffic noise and voices also. I know music not hotels fault but maybe triple glazing would help. We have a room with windows facing front of hotel maybe that’s the problem but noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in and we we have stayed in lots of cities. A bit sad as was hoping this was a hotel we could stay in frequently.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
247,Best Hotel Service,50,February 2020,"I’m kind of traveler who like to try different hotel every time on my vacay. Arrived this hotel around 6.20pm on Feb13 2020 and check in was pretty quick & awesome handle by Mr. Putra. He can’t find us deluxe room with higher floor so He is so generous upgrade our deluxe room to 1bedroom suite& We are so lucky on our Valentine’s getaway. Staff here very friendly & good hospitality. Hotel clean & green, big balcony, and have couple swimming pool. Breakfast & Meals here super recommended! Tasty meals & nice view around the pool. My decision to chose The Haven Seminyak is Best experience ever! Thank you The Haven Seminyak & Plzz always keep it up & be a great Hotel always! ❤️👍🏻",The Haven Bali Seminyak
248,Great Holiday,40,February 2020,"The Staff at this hotel are very polite and very helpful. The buffet breakfast is good as it gives you a wide selection of food choices such as they have food from Indonesia,they have pancakes and waffles, they have toast and crossants, the have omelettes that get made fresh right in front of you, they have a wide variety of fruit and juices, they also have coffee and tea. They have great swimming pools on property and a great massage spa.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
249,The Haven,40,December 2019,"The haven is perfectly located, the staff went over and beyond to ensure we were comfortable. Tariq was amazing, offering us first hand advice on places to see,eat and hang out. We ordered food from room service and wow!!!! Totally worth it. The walking distance to the beach is an added bonus",The Haven Bali Seminyak
250,Very Enjoyable Experience,50,January 2020,"I can highly recommend this hotel. The staff are absolutely lovely, friendly, and nothing is too much for them to do. The rooms are clean and comfortable, cocktails very reasonable, and we ate dinner every night in the restaurant. A big shout out to Taufiq for his exemplary service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
251,Great Hotel and excellent Service,50,January 2020,"From the moment we arrived the staff were very accommodating and friendly. We had the two bedroom Villa with a private swimming pool which was amazing. The first day though we had a minor problem with water leaking into our room creating a large puddle but the staff were quick to clean it up and fixed a leaking pipe above the room. Everything was very clean, the buffet breakfast was good although pretty much the same every day and transfers to and from the airport was effortless. Would definitely stay here again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
252,Disastrous,10,January 2020,"My family were staying in a villa which was flooded by a downpour. It was close to the Haven so we quickly booked remaining nights there. In fairness it was last minute, but the booking, and monies, were gratefully accepted of course. So two ladies and a 4 year old arrived and were kept waiting some time, OK last minute, but one would think a child around would be taken into account. After some time directed to a room which stank of smoke. Not acceptable but told we can spray the room, not good enough, back to reception to wait for another room, some time later, and certainly not gracious staff, taken to another room featuring human hair sprinkled around and stcky grime on worktops etc. Not acceptable again, told just take it and we'll change tomorrow, no more time, very late by now, Manager not available, so left to find clean accomodation and Haven refused any refund for 4 nights unused with acceptable room not offered at the time. Allowing for the fact of aa late booking, a little more courtesy and consideration in an emergency and with small child is a minimum, the lack of refund is priciple only and shows what type of establishment this really is. 1 star far too much but the minimum offering so there you go.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
253,Bogan Central,20,January 2020,"Unfortunately, the standards of this hotel are not as great as they should be.
Not always the fault of the staff, but guests treating their outdoor area opposite the front pool like this... bogan central!!! 😏 These photos were of 6 rooms in a row... scabby!! 😤",The Haven Bali Seminyak
254,Very good hotel,50,January 2020,"Wonderful hotel, very clean, good breakfast, good location, and very nice staff, especially I would like to thank to Taufiq for his kindness and efforts while we had breakfast every day. My boyfriend is gluten intolerant and he used to prepare gluten free pancakes for him every day. :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
255,Terrible. DIRTY rooms. Worst service. Rude staff.,10,February 2020,"Stayed for 3 nights. First room supposed to be non smoking. Was not, was a smoking room clearly. Son tripped over in corridor as was raining. No warning signs or slippery surface signs.
Next room was clearly dirty on every surface, in the bathroom, dust and black hairs left around room. Hotel service book was stuck to the counter as food and other dirty marks on bench. Marks on doona cover. Room had clearly not been cleaned. Waited over an hour for the hotel management to offer to CLEAN room or offer another room. We had a small child. Check in process took almost 3 hours with rude staff. Once finally found a room for us informed us we would have to change rooms the following day so would only have the room for the night. Not convenient with a child and all the hassle.

Huge hotel, staff don’t care, just another guest to them. Breakfast and restaurant below average and more expensive for Bali and considering the quality not worth it. Rooms are tired and need attention. Management were a disgrace very disappointed. Everywhere else we stayed in Bali was exceptional.

Not recommended.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
256,Mother Daughter Trip,50,February 2020,"Staying at The Haven was lovely experience for myself and my daughter. Always greeted genuinely in a very warm and friendly manner. Rooms are very clean and the pool area is lush and relaxing. Breakfast is amazing and nothing is too much trouble.
Service is superb especially from Ayu and Taufiq at dinner at Sabeens restaurant on our last night. We will be back. Thank you team.
Very highly recommended.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
257,Fabulous villa,50,January 2020,"The Haven grounds is pretty nice with several pools sprawled across their property. We stayed in their 2-bedroom villa & that was absolutely gorgeous. The villa had 2 pools & massive rooms & bathrooms. I just loved the interior. I highly recommend the villas. I also tried their Spa & it was pretty good & we’ll priced. Typically Balinese, the staff is very polite and friendly. Their breakfast buffet spread is decent & the food tasty. Though the location is just so-so for me - the shops are average & not many restaurants to choose from. But I happily return will to stay at the villas again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
258,Mrs,50,January 2020,"Loved the service, breakfast was excellent. Staff was a amazing specially Taufiq he is so beautiful we loved him. Our rooms were so clean & house cleaning were so friendly. Pool was so good. Location is amazing. We will be back this is our second time. Thanks to you all highly recommend",The Haven Bali Seminyak
259,Good hotel in Seminyak,40,January 2020,"The Haven hotel is only 5 minutes drive from Seminyak square, many shops, bars and restaurants within walking distance.
Supermarket right in front of the hotel where you can also get your money exchanged.
Friendly staff.
The breakfast was amazing, with lots of variety foods.
The famous Double Six beach is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel.

I stayed 16th-19th of January 2020",The Haven Bali Seminyak
260,Another Great Experience,50,November 2019,Once again we really enjoyed our stay at The Haven. Daily breakfast was amazing as usual. The staff are just so lovely and very helpful. Room service food was great and not costly. Spa experience was fantastic. Lemon Cello restaurant at the rear of the property is great for lunch & Dinner. Thanks again to Management & staff for the great holiday. See you all again very soon. xxxx,The Haven Bali Seminyak
261,Great experience,50,January 2020,Nicely presented rooms .suits located down the back part of the hotel are lovely and quiet with plenty of shade around the pool. Breakfast was very impressive with real coffee on offer at no extra cost. The staff are so friendly and helpful would definitely recommend staying here close to shopping district but not to close.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
262,Central Location,40,January 2020,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was spacious and everyone had their space. The grounds were great and kept immaculate and pools were great. Staff and service were great and a special shout out to Wayan who was part of the housekeeping team. It was lovely to see a smiling face every morning and was great with remembering names. Location is great, a 1 min walk to Double 6, Circle K, Laundromat, shops and spas and 5 min walk to Bintang Supermarket (which unfortunately burnt down on our third day) The only downside was buffet breakfast, not enough options and same food every day and their coffees/tea only have full cream milk which I think is strange as they should at least have skim milk as an option. The hotel is in need of an upgrade and not enough pool lounges. Would stay at The Haven again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
263,"Excellent staff, however older suites need maintenance",30,January 2020,"The staff here are absolutely fabulous, helpful and very accommodating. I would particularly like to acknowledge 2 staff members Febby Kemala Dewi (for her continued help, she was amazing) also Taufiq (restaurant assistance, who was very polite, helpful and genuinely concerned about us). However the older suites in the hotel are starting to show there again and are in much need of maintenance/repairs. We moved rooms 3 times in 2 days. First room in the older sectiona a 1 bedroom suite although very clean was in very big need of repairs/maintenance lots of water damage in bathroom and floors with damage to fridge and phone. Second room a 1 bedroom suite still in the older section had an amazing view of sunsets although the bedroom sliding doors did not close properly and the air con had to fight with the humidity and the room was very hot, also allowed for mosquitoes to enter the room, and once again lots of water damage in bathroom. Finally we were moved into the newer section of the hotel, air con worked well and very clean. Just one complaint which has nothing to do with the hotel - is the music that comes from Ja'an bar in across the road from the hotel which stops on 3am usually. Hotel management has had many discussion with the owner of Ja;an bar but still the music is quite loud.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
264,Amazing holiday,50,December 2019,"The haven Seminyak is excellent, great location and genuine friendly staff. We were welcomed by Pande who was very pleasant and upgraded our room. The hotel is kept immaculate with constant attention to detail, the standards are kept very high. It was a perfect little stay and i would love to return in the near future.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
265,Great Location and Staff,40,January 2020,Had a great 4 days at The Haven Hotel Seminyak good location with nice beach club for the star ratings. Staff are so friendly and nice. Spa though more expensive than others but had very good professional masseuse who knew the areas that where pained and relived the muscles. Very good and worth extra. Breakfast was good also for rating. The only area that needs improvement is the check in though staff friendly service was often slow. Had to wait nearly hour for our suit even though checking in after 2pm arrived 6pm. All in all a good 4 days.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
266,Great getaway,50,January 2020,"We had 4 days here in Seminyak, and stayed in this lovely resort. Staff greet you all day with a smile and a good morning,afternoon or evening.
They are always making sure that your needs are met. Great for families as well shaded kids pool. Small walk to to the beach, close to shopping and massages. We will be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
267,Excellent service,50,January 2020,"Great location, surrounded by many great restaurants and lots of shopping. Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, some even take the time to learn your name and a bit of useful information to help personalise your stay, Taufiq is especially good, going above and beyond whenever required.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
268,sad and disappointed,10,December 2019,"i have been coming to The Haven hotel for 6 years sometimes 3 to 4 times a year,they use to be nice because i was a returning regular guest they would give me a better rate than my Gold membership,this year was the first time i have not come to Bali i was planning to come twice next year, last year i was paying 800 thousand rupiah a night,now for next year and off peak season they want to charge me 1 million 100 thousand a night,400 thousand extra a night and when i asked them why they are charging me more there answer was that must take in consideration of price increase i wanted to book 1, 2 bedroom suite and 2, 1 bedrooms suites if i was to book online with there official site i would get a cheaper rate,this is how they look after there regular quest,because i have been coming here for 6 years i know each year i have been paying more with less benefits,we suite and villa quest use to have free drinks and food between 4 and 6pm each day and on monday evenings suite and villa quest use to have a private party put on for us with a band singer free snack food and drinks and a meet and greet from manager and heads of departments all stopped now,also when i have or other people have posted a problem with the hotel like air con rooms being run down,water leaking in rooms ect there is a standard reply and no action taken,the message i received today said there will be no discussion on the price but they will give us a free massage,so they are more concerned with money than looking after regular quest,i have keeped all emails from these discussions and all prices i have been charged over the last 6 years,just to show that what i am saying is true,maybe it is a punishment because this year i did nor come to The Haven and why they want to charge me more for a 2 bedroom suite than if i book direct online site,the 1 bedroom suite is a very small discount than online 2 dollars 30 cents per night but would cost more after the extra increase price for the 2 bedroom suite,the owner of this hotel group PHM hotels is more interested in making money than guest what keeps the haven popular is the hard working smiling staff,MR Eko the haven hotel reservation manager would not even return my messages asked to speak to manager and was told these are the rates and we give you a free massage and will not negotiate these prices,i am really sad and disappointed to be treated like this after staying at the haven hotel at least 9 stays over the years and a big slap in my face with a 400 thousand a night increase on last years rates,we will not be coming back again,like to mention i was in Bali 3 weeks ago stayed at another hotel near by as i was suppose to see the Haven manager i email the day before on what time but no response they told me 2 days ago the girl i had organised the meeting with the manager has left the haven hotel,that is another problem staff turn over is high over the years you get to know the staff then the following year they have gone,maybe the other reason that i am being punished is because i did post about the rats in the carpark which is underneath where we have breakfast but other guest have mentioned rats outside there rooms in past post",The Haven Bali Seminyak
269,Great Stay!,50,December 2019,"When we first arrived there was a problem with our room we had booked, so we had a twin bedded room for the first night, we changed rooms the next day, the new room was much better.
Our stay was made by the excellent staff, who looked after us well, especially in the restaurants.
We were there with friends for Christmas. The Haven laid on a brilliant Christmas Eve party, and Christmas Day dinner complete with entertainment. The staff worked so hard to give us a great Christmas, even with a visit or two from Santa!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
270,Average Experience,30,December 2019,"Location of the hotel is not too bad, but the hotel service is not very satisfying. Our room came with breakfast and the breakfast spread was full of houseflies which I was down with food poisioning after the 1st breakfast! Subsequent breakfast, I only ate those items which I think has less houseflies landings on the food. I dont understand why the restaurant doesnt want to cover up their food but left them all in the open with so many BIG houseflies flying around all the time? Also the rooms were not SOUND PROOF at all, it was very noisy even during the midnight, when your next door guests opens, their door, u can be woken up if they slam their door to close it. The live band from the restaurant downstairs can be heard loud and clear ... Sigh ... not a very relaxing and restful time ...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
271,Perfect location,50,August 2019,"fast booking in my group of 7 of us. Nice quiet rooms,Excellent breakfast and our dinner was perfect and a good price. Outside men to help you with taxis, tours etc.and plenty of places to go for massages, shops as located in a main street. Yes, we woudl all return back I hope 2020.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
272,Great stay,50,December 2019,"We couldn't ask for a better start to our Bali holiday. The Haven staff are super friendly and helpful. From our airport transfer to our first Bintang beer at the Sabeen restaurant, it was an absolute pleasure staying there and we will make this our first stop again upon visiting Bali. Buffet breakfast was amazing along with all other food served there. Central and in the buzz of Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
273,Excellent,50,December 2019,Awesome facility with lovely staff especially Taufiq who was super helpful by giving a few tips as to where and what to visit to make a time in Bali a memorable one. Thank you Taufiq! Your tips really came in handy.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
274,Great value and great staff,40,December 2019,"Stayed at The Haven for 6 nights in a ground level pool access Haven Room.

What others have written about a bit of maintenance being required in these rooms is true. You can tell this hotel was amazing, but the rooms are in need of a little TLC to bring it back to its glory. That said, my room was very comfortable and excellent value.

The restaurant food was mostly good, but one meal I had (pulled pork sandwich) was really awful. Breakfast is wonderful and I loved the fresh omelettes cooked to order in front of you. They do a pretty good coffee too.

The pool was lovely and the staff are fantastic. Friendly and kind and helpful. Desi in particular, and the young man who picked me up from the airport was also great.

The location is excellent - everything you need is very close by. Reliable money changer, safe ATMs, pharmacy, restaurants, supermarket and massages all within just a few minutes walk at most. The downside of the location is the noise, but that is to be expected when you’re staying in in a location where everything you need is a stone’s throw away.

While I didn’t stay in the back part of the hotel where the suites and villas are, I walked down and had a look and it was gorgeous - a true ‘haven’. I hear from guests staying in this part that their rooms are amazing. If I had my family with me I’d definitely stay in that part of the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
275,Superb !!,50,November 2019,"Very prompt service from reservations team member and outstanding service from reservations manager Eko. The booking process was going smoothly and I would recommend booking villa for honeymooners, so romantic.
The driver who pick up us at airport very friendly, he explain well about the tourist destination in bali. By booking direct we were offered a complementary airport pickup that was waiting on time in a great hotel vehicle that handled the luggage easily.
Check-in and reception was without hassle. The receptionist who handle the check in very prompt respond and friendly. She gave warm welcome and fresh welcome drink upon check in, So fantastic for first impression in this hotel. The concierge will assist to drop your luggage to the room.
We stay for 3 nights at one bed room villa. Room very spacious and superb swimming pool. The butler service very helpful and they are ready for 24 hours service.
The tour desk was good with professional tour guide. Some good place and recommended in bali are Ubud, Volcano tour and Coffee plantation, of course with reasonable price.
Also they provide free wifi, big swimming pool, spa, gym and free shuttle service to The Haven Beach club.
Check out process very memorable and again the concierge provide airport transfer to Bali airport. Goo place for vacation and definitely back again next year.
Thank you for great service The Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak
276,Lovely Stay. Fabulously wonderful staff,50,December 2019,"I recently stayed at the The Haven Bali in Seminyak. I had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel itself. The location was great close to shops and not far from the beach.
Thd hotel was great providing a shuttle service to the beach as well which we used. The hotel room was clean and comfortable. Reletively basic but pleasant.
Pool area was good.
What really made our stay was the staff. They were all so friendly, helpful and wonderful. The restaurant staff were lovely and in particular Desi who was so lovely and friendly and so helpful. Thank you Desi.
The other exceptional person was a wonderful friendly young man by the name of Arya who worked at reception. He was also exceptional and always greeted us each time with a smile and was always so friendly, obliging and helpful. We felt he was very approachable and willing to ensure we were comfortable and happy while we stayed at the hotel in every way. After checkout I forgot to get my razor from the bathroom cabinet. Arya ensured he investgated and located my property exceptionally quickly. Thank you so much Arya. You are a wonderful friendly emplyee and a great asset to the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

278,Неожиданный поворот,10,December 2019,"Booked hotel from agoda, they gave us good sale. We arrived in hotel, make check in and when we waited our room I god on email massage that our booking canceled. They canceled our booking and ask higher price for it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
279,Great stay,40,December 2019,Very helpful staff and lovely pool areas. Rooms were always kept well and we're very clean. Breakfast was varied and lots of it. Great shuttle to the beach area for use of the guests. Well situated for shopping and restaurants. Overall a very good stay.,The Haven Bali Seminyak

281,Good service,40,December 2019,"With a few bad experiences at The Haven in seminiyak, I am pretty please with the service quality that they are offering now and have really upgraded their service. A good convenient and easy going stay. Good on the pocket too",The Haven Bali Seminyak
282,Holiday,50,November 2019,"Absolutely love this hotel. Location is perfect, away from busy eat street but also close enough to walk down to a variety of restaurants.

Our recent stay at the haven couldn’t have been any better. The staff went out of their way for my mums birthday. One particular staff member, Desi in the restaurant.

Breakfast is always yummy & good variety. My favourite was the pancakes.

Our room on the ground floor access to the pool was great. Can’t fault anything about it.

I will definitely be back Haven.

Keep smiling staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
283,Great hotel,50,November 2019,"We only stayed one night but cannot fault the hotel. Great location, friendly staff. We were upgraded to a suite even though stayed only one night. Breakfast really good. Awesome value for money. Pool is in the shade most of the day. Thank you for looking after us.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
284,Do not stay here - unsafe and noisy,10,November 2019,"I stayed here for 5 nights for my birthday. On checkin i was advised checkin is 3pm even though I had advised early arrival.
I did not expect room to be ready on arrival, however at 2pm it got a bit ridiculous. No welcome drink provided.

On checkin my room was not 'available' and got 2 single beds and a very dates room close to the front of hotel- if you want sleep do not bother with this hotel. There is a live music venue opposite with noise till 3am.
Room was pretty ok but smelled.

Worst thing is on my last night I decided to eat in the restaurant for the bbq steak night (very expensive) but as a birthday treat to myself.
On paying the bill i unfortunately left my bag open and got money stolen while in the restaurant. There was a staff on a ladder outside the restaurant when going back to my room.

I obvliously let my guard as I thought i would be safe in my home in Bali - but do not less this fool you - the Haven is there to take your money only. Obvliously an inside job and targeted as i was on my own.

Tour desk very expensive.
Staff friendly but you are just a number...no personalised servise as i have got everywhere else in Bali.
Very dissappointing.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME - DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
285,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS,50,November 2019,I have just spent a week at THE HAVEN in Seminyak and have never had such amazing service or been treated with such genuine care and consideration by all of the staff. The position for us was perfect as it was equidistant from Kuta to Seminyak square. Fabulous breakfast with real coffee and freshly pressed juice. Just a really wonderful week in a perfect resort.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
286,Georgia corbett,50,November 2019,"We really enjoyed our stay! The cooks, hotel staff and reception staff specifically Wulan she was lovely and they were amazing! We felt extremely welcome on arrival and everyday they made us feel very happy and always asked if we needed anything! Extremely polite and very fun. The breakfast buffet was a wide range and delicious. Would really recommend staying here. I required gluten free meals, and they made sure I had gluten free option for breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
287,Wouldnt stay again,30,November 2019,"We arrived and the front office staff were fantastic. My friends and I had the 2 bedroom suite for 5 nights and the room was great. However it was so far away from the front of the building and pool area, we only used the pool once. Not enough sun lounges for everyone. Breakfast is beyond basic and at 6am every morning you can hear the staff setting up for breakfast at the other end of the hotel. not ideal.
Loved the shuttle to the beach and utilised this twice. Lovely staff.
I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, its too big for what it is and the facilities weren't the best. More like a 3 star. Need massive improvements on the breakfast menu. Go check out Courtyard Marriott for ideas because breakfast is amazing there!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
288,Just for a cocktail,30,November 2019,"Good but not great. The coffee was awful and the cocktails just averaged. The staff was helpful and friendly and they were also quick. Nice place, very cozy and big. The truth is that it is a nice place for the area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
289,Beautiful hotel!,50,February 2019,"I loved my stay here! The hotel offers hotel rooms, suites and villas. The hotel room was small but very nice with everything you need and the price is so cheap! The staff very friendly and service efficient. Will be back for sure!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
290,We will be back!,50,November 2019,"Just come back from the tail end of 3 1/2 week in Bali, finishing our trip at The Haven Suites Seminyak
This was our third stay and we were
Not disappointed.
We stayed 9 nights. The suites are extremely spacious with a huge balcony with queen size day bed at one end.
Although the suites are part of a large complex it
Manages to retain a quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Breakfast was delicious with bacon cooked to order - not the overcooked bacon you usually get. A great variety satisfying all tastes.
Staff treated you with utmost respect, from the gardeners to the front desk acknowledging you every time. Perfect location. Pools were never crowded with the option of using a golf cart to a sectioned part of the beach which provided security.
Definitely returning again. Definitely recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
291,Have stayed before and will stay again,40,November 2019,"I have stayed at The Haven twice now and would highly recommend for many reasons!

Positives:
- located on one of many main streets of Seminyak, easy to explore surrounding area and shops. Heaps of great cafes, bars and shops.
- Connivence store just next door so easy to stock up on water and snacks.
- Delicious buffet style breakfast with the best iced coffee
- 3 pools to choose from, all with shaded areas. Beautiful and quiet for the most part. Middle of the day is generally the busiest with kids.
- Big spacious rooms for excellent price!
- Wonderfull, happy and helpful staff.
- Close to airport but not too close.
- Adorable kittens which hang around resort.

The only negative I have was the cleanliness of the bathroom.
The main bathroom was in need of a good bleach and scrub. There was hair around the taps which easily washed away but it would just be nice to have it all pristine on arrival. Also our shower drain seems to be blocked so after just a few minutes the bath would fill with water not draining.
I advised the front desk as checking out so they could fix up for next guest.

Would always like to stay here when I visit Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
292,Great Hotel in the central of Seminyak,50,November 2019,The hotel is in the middle of seminyak area. Many stores and restaurants around the hotel. The room so clean and large. The situation of the hotel is so peaceful and quiet. Very clean and beautiful. The staffs so friendly and helpful.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
293,Best holiday excellent for families,50,October 2019,"We stayed in a villa and highly recommend .We had our own pool and was the best.There was only 4 of us staying at the villa and was so roomy.The service and food was excellent in both restaurants.
Itwas away from busy Kuta but had everyhting you needed close by.
Walking distance to the beach but there is also a shuttle bus.
Highly recommend for families or couples.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
294,Don't be Fooled by the Haven's Good Looks,20,November 2019,"One of my worst experiences in Bali period.

The Haven was our first stop in Bali and due to the way the hotel is run the start to our holiday was very let down. As we arrived we were told our check in was 1 hour later then what was on our booking. All they could do was apologise and expressed for us to wait even longer in the restaurant and bar. Then as we went to check in again, we were told that OUR room was still booked out, the room that we had booked several months beforehand was not ready for us.....they said we could have another room but they weren't the type we specificity requested, we obliged as anyone would after a long flight. We settled in and all was fine.

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet the next day, lots of variety and delicious food. Their
swimming pools were lovely and a great way to relax for awhile.

It wasn't until that afternoon in the blazing heat that we got back to the room and our keycard no longer worked, we had been locked out with all our possessions still inside. After a trip to the reception they said we were being moved back to our original room we booked as it was now available. The last thing we wanted was to have to repack our suitcases and change rooms, we had just gotten here so we asked to stay in the room they had given us yet to be told that room was also booked for someone else.....

So out of both situations our room was booked out and then the room they gave us was also booked out, while we are the ones in-between having to waste our time on holiday to sort our which room we are staying in. Don't be fooled by how nice the hotel looks, how its run is dysfunctional.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
295,Ok for the price,30,September 2019,"We stayed here for four nights whilst visiting Bali. The rooms were ok but a little dated and damaged. The location is fine as it is very cheap to get blue bird taxis in the area. The breakfast was amazing value for money and the staff are very friendly. Our main complaint would be the cleanliness of our room, which still had hair and dirty marks in when we first arrived. However, this was soon amended on the second day which we saw a great improvement.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
296,WORST Experience,10,November 2019,"I have be travelling to Bali twice a year for the past 12 years and this has been the worst hotel experience I have every had. We arrive to check in only to be given a room with two beds rather than a double, and said that our double room will only be available the following day. The following day arrives and our room still isn’t ready and to make matters worse they locked us out our previous room and took our bags. We finally got to our room and our DVD/TV wasn’t working it took them over 3 hours to sort it out for us. On the day of leaving we had checkout at 1pm. We go out and come back at 12pm to find us locked out our room once again. At no point have they compensated or offered us anything for the inconvenience they caused. I come to Bali to relax and staying at this hotel added more stress than needed. I strongly do no recommend this hotel and find it hard to believe they have a rating of 8.5. Trust me do don’t take the risk at staying here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
297,Great customer service..Always a pleasure to be treated with full respect..,50,November 2019,"I would like to awknowledge one particular worker at The Haven who always goes out of his way to look after me and ensure my stay is comfortable.
ARYA had been looking after me for the last 3 year's I have been staying at the hotel and never one time have I been treated with the utmost respect. Everytime I walk past reception and ARYA is on duty he will stop what he is doing to awknowledge me and always with a smile will say ""Is everything ok? Do you need anything"".
I have thought about moving hotels as staying in one place every time I visit Bali sometimes gets a bit to much, however with the service I receive from ARYA how can I possabily move. A VERY RESPECTABLE KIND LOVING PERSON WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO GO OUT OF HIS WAY. management needs to be proud with the service ARYA offers to the guests at the hotel. WELL DONE ARYA and thank you again for looking after me.
Anyone planning to stay at THE HAVEN please try it. Rooms are clean and tidy. Breakfast is great and service is great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
298,Top notch,50,November 2019,"Stayed at The Haven for just one night when we first arrived in Seminyak, and it was lovely. Attention to detail is present throughout the property.

The good:
Spacious room
Comfortable bed
Connecting rooms possible for those who need them
Bathroom includes a tub and shower, both of which are divine
Balinese bed on the spacious patio is comfortable, chairs also provided
Restaurant overlooks the street, which is great for people watching
Restaurant offerings are varied
Pool is nice, with shade in places
Resort kitties are cute and likely keep other critters at bay for the most part

The bad:
Not really much to say here
Did notice there's a lip on the flooring where the edge of the bathroom meets the hallway leading to it - presumably to keep and excess water from leaving the bathroom - it's not very noticeable until you catch a toe on it
The tub is slippery, recommend laying a small towel in it if you're showering
The resort kitties don't really belong to them, more likely they're just local kitties, but they can be quite insistent and vocal if you share some of your meal with them 😜

Access:
The resort is situated in the midst of hustle and bustle of the area - you can step out right into the thick of things and explore. It's a short walk to the beach and many amenities are close by.

Overall:
It feels much like an oasis in the midst of the busy area, and we were sad to have been there for only one night. Would have enjoyed another night or two. It really did have the feel of a Haven in the midst of the active social vibe of Seminyak. Highly recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
299,Naturally elegant,50,November 2019,"after two years we returned to Bali, at the Haven Hotel, it was like coming home, the suites are very large, very comfortable and very clean.
I would like to thank
Mrs. Daesy and Shelfie from the breakfast room,
Mr. Putra Assistant Manger,
Mr. Murtini, room supervisor
for their courtesy, kindness, availability, for their smile and above all for their professionalism.
last but not least a special thanks to the excellent Mr. Sugi. floor manager , who helped us and satisfied our every request",The Haven Bali Seminyak
300,Home away from home!,50,September 2019,"Yet again we have experienced another wonderful and relaxing stay (our sixth) at The Haven.
The one bedroom suite was spacious, comfortable, clean, quiet and provided a really relaxing experience.
As always, the staff were friendly & accommodating and treated us like family returning for another visit home. It is always a pleasure to see Ayu, Riyani, Marcel and the many other staff who offer their friendship and outstanding customer service.
The service and quality of accommodation experience is always consistent at The Haven and we will look forward to our 7th visit again soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
301,Pictures don’t do it justice,40,November 2019,"Solo traveller here! Being as such I searched for a nice hotel close to everything and The Haven was the perfect spot! The hotel is close to the beach (5-10min walk or free shuttle), shops and restaurants all around and about 20 min walk to Seminyak Village! They also have a little beach club which has a nice view of the water and cozy chairs to lounge on. The staff were kind & accommodating, truly making my stay a very positive experience!
Looking at the grounds pictures from my home computer I wasn’t sure if it would meet my needs. However, in person the grounds are beautiful! The pools, trees, cleanliness and culture were just beautiful! The rooms were clean and quiet. Overall a great experience and nice hotel for the price. I highly recommend!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
302,Nice place... Greedy management,30,November 2019,"The photos speak for themselves BUT!!! I was there 9 days when I found out that I had good friends in Nusa Dua, that I had not seen for many years, which is 40 min drive away. I asked for a refund for 3 days that I had left to go and stay with them the Nusa Dua as I had not seen them for a long time!! They did not care and said it’s hotel policy to only refund for emergency. Well my policy is that I’m a full time traveller and my policy is that I will never return to this place and word of mouth is a powerful advertising tool. They gained a few hundred dollars from me but they will lose tens of thousands on an ongoing period!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
303,A little bit of Haven,50,November 2019,"Spent 10 days at The Haven Suites Seminyak. We booked a one bedroom suite as we wanted some room for our stay. Wow the size of the room was outstanding, separate bedroom with king bed, living room and kitchen. The best part a full size fridge so able to buy plenty of drinks and fresh fruits to keep cold. We started off each day having breakfast in Limoncello restaurant, which is at the suites end of the hotel. Each morning we were greeted by the most amazing, friendly and genuine person Sri, the breakfast host, each day she would ask how we were, what’s ours plans and how we slept. These were genuine questions as Sri was turkey interested. The best part we go to chose our breakfast and upon return our coffee would be waiting, didn’t have to ask. The hotel is self is wonderful and the staff happy and caring, evening thanking us for staying. Will we return? For sure, will I recommend? Most differently.
Thank you for an amazing stay. Mr Shane says hello Sri, see you next year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

305,Nice but average,30,November 2019,"The hotel is located on a main road and therefore very noisy day a until late at night
Rooms are clean but already show signs of wear and tear everywhere.
The pool is a bit small but ok
Budget hotel and suitable for everyone",The Haven Bali Seminyak
306,Stunning outdoor areas,40,November 2019,"Even though we still had a mix up with the rooms our stay here was pleasant! The pools and outdoor areas are great and there's plenty of day beds, lots in the shade as well.
Restaurants were nice and the food is great. Plenty of evening events hosted in the hotel or a short walk to double six beach and plenty of restaurants around the area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
307,Pure Bliss,50,March 2019,"It was a great highlight of my backpacking trip to stay in such a luxurious hotel. I stayed in one of their villas and I am so glad I did, the butler was so friendly and excellent customer service skills. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
308,Great Visit,50,October 2019,I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. Putra was fantastic in helping with my arrival and upgrading me to a Superior Suite due to high numbers of visitors in standard. Made me feel very welcome and the hotel is high class..,The Haven Bali Seminyak
309,The Haven is the Most Cost-Effective Option in it's Class,50,September 2019,"Location, price, service and well appointed rooms. What else can you say? There are a number of features that makes The Haven standout as an outstanding mid range hotel in Seminyak. Overall it is a brilliant cost-effective option which I am sure is why so many guests seem to return regularly. If reasonable price for quality (including breakfast) in the heart of Legian / Seminyak is your objective this is probably the hotel for you in Bali.

This was our fifth recent Bali holiday in the area to the north of Kuta; our more recent target was to find something at least as good as the Amadea hotel in heartland Seminyak (on Eat Street near Seminyak Square). Staying previously at the Amadea, it was for us a benchmark - where we had a week that was affordable and quite superb and recommended. Subsequently, to experience a different area we looked to Legian, to be nearer to the beach and Double 6 and in 2018 we discovered the Haven. A brilliant option.

In the interim there were other hotels you may have considered. We had a previous very forgettable experience at the nearby Astagina hotel and a mediocre experience at the Ananta hotel. So for us the Haven was our must return option in 2019. There is no doubt that a hotel can determine just how good your holiday experience is and good ones bring you back. In the Haven our faith, in finding a great affordable mid rank 4 star hotel, was restored. So, if affordability, location, easy access in Seminyak with quality service for the tariff is your objective, forget the rest and book at the Haven. It seems the hotel is constantly full which reflects its' popularity and probably its’ pricing.

Where it is located is excellent. On the main street (Jalan Seminyak) but with access direct on to Jln Arjuna (Double 6 street) it was close to the Bintang supermarket, walking distance to Ku Da Ta, close enough to Eat street and Seminyak Square, near many of the notable restaurants, not far north of all that Legian offers and even nearby Kuta if that is your thing. Additionally, it has a beach club with a scheduled shuttle drop off and pick up, yet it is only 10 minutes walk to the beach. The beach club has limited sun-loungers so book your shuttle and beach space with reception. Or there is an adequate pool that is very popular with sufficient loungers and a swim-up bar. And there is a second pool that is well shaded in the suites area of the hotel that you can use if the pool loungers are all taken. These facilities are far more than many others offer and are highly rated by guests.

Staying 5 nights there were bonuses. By booking direct we were offered a complementary airport pickup that was waiting on time in a great hotel vehicle that handled the luggage easily. Additionally our booking included a complementary one hour spa / massage session for two that was up to the best in Bali in all respects – clean, on-site, superb amenities, great massage service, and no booking hassles.

A feature of the Haven is the staff, well versed in English, obliging and ever courteous. Check-in and reception was without hassle, housekeeping could not be faulted, there are plenty of staff if you need assistance. We found Mr Eko Yulianto (Reservations Manager) most helpful both in the direct booking process and with follow up inquiries. He was amongst the best we have encountered in meeting all requests and ensuring all was in place for the booking through the stay. He knows his business and is a prime asset at the Haven. Thank you again.

We asked to return to room 4020 (which is on the fourth floor) as previously and they obliged. This room has been renovated and is recommended if available. It is a junior suite that was spacious and open plan with a superb pool view balcony that was narrow but extensive with furniture and afternoon sun. The room had good lift access to the hotel’s top floor and was well located close to the reception and the restaurant but away from the street. Specify this as the street can be noisy. The suite had a sizeable bedroom, separate lounge area with comfortable seating, two modern wall-mounted TVs, dining area with mini fridge (but no cooking facility), sliding door to separate the rooms and good blackout curtaining. Security is well set up, safe is the usual, plenty of wardrobe and storage space, perhaps a lacking in drawer space if you like to unpack, and a king bed that was comfortable with a mattress topper (and therefore not rock hard as some are in Bali).

The bathroom can make or break a hotel room – ours was the best of what 4 star will offer, modernised it had a separate toilet, a discrete large shower, double hand-basins and a bath, good mirrors and shelving with all amenities and usual array of bathroom necessities.

All in all the room was phenomenal for the price charged and left other 4 star Bali hotels behind in all respects. It is no wonder guests return time and time again.

Breakfast is a clincher for many at the Haven. We saw day after day people coming in off the street to breakfast here. The reason was the excellent price for the quality. Ours was an inclusive of breakfast booking and we enjoyed it with some variety over 5 days. Not the most comprehensive we have ever seen perhaps but it was replenished and for a 4 star at the price was exceptional. All the usual juices, fresh fruits and yoghurts, cereals, bakery items with adequate pastries, an array of Indonesian and Indian hot dishes, an egg station (ask for a poached egg) , they served chicken and pork with yes pork bacon. Increasingly, some Balinese restaurants / warangs and hotels are not serving pork bacon (religious reasons) and beef bacon does not measure up. They provide real coffee on request and the street view over breakfast is interesting and entertaining. One small feature is the need to monitor the smoking around the fringes of the reception and restaurant. The wafting smoke from smokers does ruin breakfast for others and the staff needs to be bold and challenge smokers emphasising the non smoking signs. If you come from a society where smoking is increasingly not viewed well, usually prohibited, to have smokers around meals and reception and the pool ignoring no smoking signs is hard to tolerate.

There are some brilliant cafes (warangs) nearby – Grain, Mozzarella, several on Jln Arjuna / Double 6 – and others that are very ordinary so be prepared to scrutinise carefully. Bluebird taxis are the safe option with meters and venturing from the hotel is cheap indeed. In summary, for an extended stay or a few days the Haven offers a value for money option with some outstanding features. It is indeed popular with European and Australian guests who have discovered this haven in Seminyak, and one we will recommend, and to which we look forward to returning, as it does outclass for value and quality comparable hotels in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
310,AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE,50,October 2019,"What an experience!

Great location, clean rooms, nice Amenities and above all, Excellent Customer Service.

We arrived 6 hours before check in but everyone in the hotel made us feel very welcome. From security Guards, to waiters, to pool attendants and of course to front office team.

Ayu Mas’ wonderful service really made our stay a memorable one!

She is truly an asset to this company and the kind of staff that every hospitality industry must have!

Cheers!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
311,A great stay,40,October 2019,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Haven as the location and facilities were great. Our rooms were ground floor next to the pool which was great during the day but not so much at night as it was incredibly noisy meaning we got little sleep the first night. After asking to move rooms, staff quickly obliged and although the new room was much improved, their was still a fair amount of music to be heard each night. Other members of the family stayed at the rear of the hotel in a suite and said it was incredibly quiet. Other than that, we enjoyed the music, had excellent service and enjoyed the pool. Yes, the rooms are a little tired but still excellent value for money. Would definitely return to the Haven..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
312,The haven seminyak,50,October 2019,Visited Bali in October 2019. Fantastic resort close to all amenties. Tasty brekky.Very friendly staff. Febbie the supervisor and Adihi the manager were super accommodating. Will certainly return to The Haven should we return to Bali again. Highly recommended.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
313,Stop over after flight,50,October 2019,"Very comfortable hotel. Reasonable price. Lovely pool and fitness facilities. Very friendly and helpful staff.
Room very comfortable and well provided. Welcome drink. Breakfast buffet was good. Pancakes. Omelettes and eggs. Plus Indonesian fare and sweet stuff.
Will return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
314,We downgraded from One Bedroom Suite to Junior Suite,40,October 2019,"My parents and I initially booked One Bedroom Suite and found the room to be inconvenient for several reasons. Firstly, it was far away from the lobby (10-15 minutes walk, which feels forever for my 60-year-old parents). Secondly, the shower and bathtub are combined and the bathtub was slippery, so climbing in and out of the bathtub feels dangerous. Thirdly, the room feels old with cracks and needs updating.

A day later, we manage to secure a Junior Suite room which is closer to the lobby on the 4th floor. The room recently completed its renovation, and it was modern and clean. The bathroom and shower were separate. I wish there's a proper door to separate the bathroom and bedroom. Also, the shower has no dry flooring area. Overall, despite its smaller size, we were happier with the Junior Suite room.

The breakfast has a good variety - we especially like the Indonesian selection. Their Balinese dishes are yummy. Hotel location is a win, with nearby eateries & Circle K convenience store opposite.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
315,BEST Experience!,50,October 2019,"I stayed here with 2 of my girlfriends and we were in heaven!! We got the 2 bedroom villa and I can't say how very excited and pleased we were with it. I love the indoor/outdoor living concept. We felt so spoiled!! The front desk staff was very friendly and attentive. We knew ahead of time that they (and our driver) preferred to communicate via WhatsApp, so we downloaded it. Each time we texted them, they responded within 5 minutes! We always ordered our breakfast the night prior and in the AM, they were prompt and cheerful as they delivered it to our villa. Customer service here is top notch!!!

This villa is walking distance to the beach, many shops and restaurants and anything else you may need. Very convenient! It is off the main road which is good, but at night it's a little shady getting to the villa. I would not recommend walking alone.

I'm not sure how some people can write such bad things about this place. They must have had super high expectations (were they expecting Four Seasons?) or just plain mad at the world and complain about everything! This is Bali people!! Relax, take it all in and be grateful. Practice some namaste in your life!

We took so many photos of the villa and our family and friends were so envious. I plan on returning in June 2020 and will definitely stay here again. I loved every minute of it and was so sad we had to leave:o(",The Haven Bali Seminyak
316,Very nice hotel.,40,October 2019,"When we arrived at The Haven it was very busy, but all of the staff made time for all of the guests checking in. Throughout our stay we found all of the staff very friendly and helpful. The rooms where nicely fitted out with some small signs of age but mainly seemed well maintained. One comment in regards to there nightly buffets is there was no mention of pricing for children which we had to ask for. I would happily return here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
317,Good place,40,October 2019,Our family enjoyed the stay! Location was good. It is not a new place but does have charm - the suite was very spacious. Balcony was very big and useful for relaxing. Staff were mostly friendly and well trained....,The Haven Bali Seminyak
318,Weekend getaway,50,September 2019,"Our stay was wonderfull!!! Service was all good. Staffs are very friendly. Reception was attentive that they handle our request very well. Thanks to Febby for looking after us.
The room is big enough for the family. The food was ok. Concierge is very friendly. They help us with the luggage and assist us to the room.
There is also free shuttle going to the beach club and you can see many shops nearby along the road to the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
319,Family holiday,50,September 2019,"Over a 5 day period in mid September myself and my cousin stayed at the haven hotel, which was by far one of the best experiences of our many times in Bali! The staff were amazing especially the front of house and guest relations! Even though we wanted to upgrade our rooms Ernita from guest relations made this extremely easy!
The bar staff were great and very friendly and all the amenities at the hotel were more than adequate.
In all we had a fantastic time and would definitely recommend the haven to anyone wanting to stay in Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
320,Service excellent,50,October 2019,"Seldom you find such ""quality care"" as we experienced at this hotel. We truly made the right choice for trip. The rooms were very clean and spacious. The staffs gave the best for us. Upon check in friendly reception will welcome you with smile. And the buffet breakfast was one you seldom find in hotels (even restaurants) with great variety. We also met Febby in guest relation who was so nice and courteous. This hotel also has free shuttle going to the beach with friendly concierge will drive you off to the beach. Looking forward to coming back to this hotel......a home away from home!!! Thank you the Haven!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
321,Exceptional Breakfast,50,July 2019,"We visited here every day during our recent holiday. The selection was extensive, well stocked & delicious. Staff were very friendly & catered to all our requests. Exceptional value for money. It was also a great spot for offering different themed food nights & a relaxing open space for a mid afternoon Bintang!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
322,"Green ambience, so relaxing.",50,October 2019,"A perfect hotel location in the downtown of Seminyak. As you entered the lobby you will be welcomed by friendly reception and the view of big pool. The concierge will help you to check in to the room which is very great.
The breakfast buffet is various. Febby in guest relation is looking after us for everthing's going well during our stay.
The massage would make you enjoy the holiday. And this hotel also provide a free shuttle going to their private beach club. I would recommend the hotel and come back!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
323,Wonderful time in the Haven,50,October 2019,"As i checked in, the reception welcomed us very warm. Our reservation was going smoothly. The rooms we have is clean and the housekeeping staff is attentive.
The pool is well maintained and very inviting since the first time.
Upon breakfast i met Febby in guest relation who was very attentive during our stay.
Spa treatment was worth having.
I would recommend the Haven to others!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
324,Clean hotel,40,October 2019,"Very clean hotel, staff are very friendly and great variety for breakfast. Pool is a good size and shuttle service to beach which is helpful close to everything like bintang supermarket and shopping. Great location and not so busy like Kuta and Legian",The Haven Bali Seminyak
325,Amazing hotel with great value for money,50,September 2019,"We stayed here for two weeks and I was very impressed with the hotel. For the price of our stay I thought everything was to a great standard including the breakfast, cleanliness and customer service. Both check in and check out were quick and efficient and throughout our stay all staff were very friendly. The pool areas are so relaxing and lots of shade is available if you are pale skinned like me! The breakfast had so much choice and we had complimentary water in our rooms each day. The reception were also great at booking blue bird taxis for us and the hotel arranged pick up and drop off for us at the airport. The rooms were cleaned well every day and although the bathroom was in need of a little repair/TLC it still was fully functional and who wants to stay in the room on holiday anyway? The beach is a 10 min walk away and we also used the hotel spa which I was really impressed with, so relaxing! Thank you for a great stay, I would 100% recommending this hotel if you are on a budget holiday but dont want to sacrifice the quality of your accommodation. Thanks for an amazing holiday!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
326,Great fun at Satay Night,50,September 2019,"We had a magnificent fun night at Lemoncello poolside restaurant. Pardita was so accommodating and loads of fun. Food was great the atmosphere was outstanding.
The satay sticks where cooked fresh to order and yummy.
What a hidden gem.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
327,Pleasantly surprised,40,September 2019,"I must admit I was skeptical booking here after seeing so many varied reviews. We stayed for a week in a 1 bedroom suite and our adult kids stayed in the standard rooms. Yes, the rooms are a bit tired and need some maintenance, however they are very clean and tidy and comfortable.
The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful, every time we saw a staff member they always said hello and greeted us. On our last day I was in the lift and one of the staff thanked me for staying at their hotel which was lovely.
It was great to always have a security guard at the front of the hotel who always stopped traffic to get you safely across the road, no matter which side you were on!
We had a really good time at The Haven and would definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
328,Sadly to leave,50,April 2019,"We stayed for couple nights .
Everything is good.
We went there by a car.
They have lift on the ground floor (ground parking lot)
The staff so helpful.
But they don't have big lobby .
So we stood to wait for our turn to check in (no chair available for us)

Room is fine, we loved it .
I ordered honeymoon setup.
Nice balcony , spotless towel .
Perfect room service.
Great staff from the restaurant, especially at the breakfast time.
Lots food you can eat at the restaurant and also they served traditional food .

We always spend time at the swimming pool and had couple drinks.

Few minutes by walking to the beach, also lots of beautiful shop around the beach
The hotel have special sun bed for in-house guests.

The gym so mini. Not to much we can do at the gym, just few equipment.

We got late check-out till 2pm without extra charge . Good deal for us because we going to airport in the evening.

In last month we would like to book the room, But we couldn't cause full booked.
We loved The Heaven
Wish someday we could to stay in another lovely holidays",The Haven Bali Seminyak
329,Best cocktails after shopping.,50,September 2019,We always come here after a morning of shopping and love their cocktails. Very friendly staff and the security guys are very professional and help you get a taxi or cross the street. Great prices and strong cocktails! Definitely a fave.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
330,Very tired rooms,30,September 2019,"Good bits.
Bed, pillows, size of 1 bed suites. Fridge in kitchen.

Bad bits.
Dirty room/s. Floors were dusted only, not sure when physically last cleaned. Removable dirty spots throughout room.
Very very tired rooms.
Kitchen is empty, literally all cupboards are empty.
Kitchen benches are stained and dirty. You can see the dried stains on counter top.
A/c blows hot air (living room)
Bedroom a/c better but not great.
Broken floor tiles, everywhere in complex.
Broken/stained furniture.

Another guest reported her a/c leaks water and advised same about room condition.
Another guest reported similar issues.

Overall price reflects condition. We paid $480 Aus for 5 nights which includes breakfast. So it is cheap.

Photos are of floors, benches and furniture. (Had trouble loading photos at Bali airport will load up once back home)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
331,"Great stay, would return",40,September 2019,"Stayed in a haven room for 9 nights in September with my partner. We had a fantastic stay. Sure the room could use a bit of maintenance but everything worked great! We had a ground room floor by the pool which we enjoyed, easy access to the pool. The breakfast was great everyday. The restaurant is expensive for “Bali” standards, but the food was always really great! The circle k across the street sells really cheap bintangs. The spa is lovely, had a one hour massage. The staff is really professional and so nice, everyone smiles and says hello. We would definitely stay here again!

Great places around hotel:
Kimberly spa
Moon cheese warung
Dod burger
Brunch club
Bintang supermarket",The Haven Bali Seminyak
332,"Grubby, dirty, in desperate need of a face lift",20,September 2019,"The photos of this hotel when you are looking to book look lovely. The reality is this hotel was built ten years ago and looks as though it has had no maintenance. The pool area was fine, the room was disgusting.
Cracked tiles lead you to your room, with dirt and thick floor dust decorating the edges.
Get in to your room and look around- you start noticing it’s not as nice as you had hoped.
A few days in and the bed is killing your back, the pillows have no neck support and I’m already thinking of how much in physio appointments i’ll need.
By day three the stench from all the bathroom drains was overpowering. Inducing actual dry wretch by the last day.
The bathroom walls have splashes of dirt all over them, especially round the sink and the shower area is just foul. I’m sure showering in there is the only clean it gets.

The hotel prices for drinks and food is extortionate and the food is less than average quality.
The location of this hotel is also less then favourable- it’s the wrong side of seminyak to feel safe or walk to decent restaurants and bars. The hotel “transport” attempt to charge you 150k for what’s normally a 27k journey.

Avoid this hotel if you want to have a nice holiday.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
333,Clean and Comfortable,40,September 2019,A very tidy hotel. The pool area was always clean and well used .The room was a good size with a king bed clean bathroom. Check in and out was quick and easy with the friendly staff. The only downside was the amount of traffic in the whole Seminyak area but it was close enough to walk to the beach. Would certainly stay here if I was in that part of Bali again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
334,Villa Sanket Kuta Bali,50,August 2019,"Just back from wonderful 4 week in Villa Sanket in the Kuta Royal complex which is part of Bali Villa Havens. We where a party of 11 seniors and we found the villa Sanket accommodated us all comfortably. We found the villa very clean. The staff where very friendly and polite, nothing was to much trouble for them. I was taken ill over there and Yeoman the villa manager went out of his way to find medical help. He waited until the doctor arrived and called in every morning to see how i was while i was ill. Breakfast was great and there was so much food and the price was very. cheap. Becky the massage lady was great, great massages and she took our washing every couple of days and brought it back washed and ironed.Becky was just great. Would be quite happy to stay at the Villa Sanket anytime.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
335,2 Star maybe,10,September 2019,I could not belive the room . Its too old and dirty.Its totally disappointment . We are stay in the 2nd building (208) room is too dirty . Bathroom is very old and dirty. The building can be old but at least they can renovate the furnitures. This is unbelivable it cant be four stars hotel.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
336,The Haven Hotel - Highly Recommend,50,September 2019,"Stayed 7 nights and was so enjoyable with regular Theme night dinners and superb entertainment that was fantastic, reasonably priced and delicious, organised beautifully by high energy staff member Pardita. Breakfast was delicious and extensive higly recommend this hotel...great staff who can’t do enough for you and great facilities. Will definitely be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
337,Great Staff and breakfast but the Beds are worn out !!,20,August 2019,"Third trip to Seminyak and first stay at the popular Haven. First thing , the great Breakfast options and breakfast staff was the only highlight for us. The Beds where the worst I have experienced in a hotel since my back packing younger years . They are simply worn out . We asked for a bed topper to be added to try and add some comfort . but we both still awoke in pain . Spent the third night next door at the Horizon hotel , at extra cost to try and get some sleep , where the beds where so much better for a cheaper hotel . A Hotels number one priority should be bed comfort . Recommend staying next door instead if you would like to sleep. Very disappointed !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
338,Breakfast Buffet is good; rooms need to be updated,30,August 2019,"The staff is very nice and were always smiling and saying hello to the guests. The breakfast buffet was very large with a lot of choices. The pool was nice as well. The only downside was that the rooms are a little dated and could use an update. Other than that, it was a decent place to stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
339,Disappointing,30,September 2019,"I stayed at The Haven in March this year, and was very disappointed. I was staying with two other travel companions and we each had our own room. The dampness in the rooms were terrible, and we all ended up with chest and breathing problems. A 30 minute wait for eggs at breakfast was unacceptable. I had to stay here again in September, I decided to upgrade myself to a one bedroom suite. The suites are nice and comfortable with a very large balcony. My only gripe with this hotel is the noise. Absolutely horrible. The buildings are all very close together with the pools between the buildings. I had young guys in the Suites pool drinking their Bintangs at 8am in the morning and by the end of the day were extremely rowdy (8pm in the pool), with no respect for others around them. They would get up at 6.30am in the morning, and make a great deal of noise and yell between balconies. The only upside was the location of this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
340,Good location,30,September 2019,Situated in Seminyak near Bintang market has fridge no water no bar fridge with ant drinks at all top rooms near 3 red floor overlooks villanot so private kitchen some run downfridge does not work brought drinks can’t keep cold sewage smell room great bath and pool large but hoped bit better,The Haven Bali Seminyak
341,Took my money but NO CONFIRMATION,10,September 2019,"Spent nearly $2000 AUS on a room, and they've lost our booking! No confirmation number, no email, no nothing... Called the front desk and they simply have nothing in their system, but we have the credit card charge! Booked directly through their website! What an absolute scam. AVOID",The Haven Bali Seminyak
342,Mixed Review,30,September 2019,"I have never stayed at a hotel where I have loved parts of the experience and hated other parts. Will start with the positives first.

The staff are all so lovely, friendly and polite and are a credit to the owner and they are a wonderful asset to the hotel.

The room was large - we booked a 1 bedroom suite that was down the back. We did not have any issues with noise that other reviewers have mentioned.

The tour operators are great and we had a great experience and I would recommend them when booking your trips and even a car to the airport.

Location is very central, and they have a shuttle service to an exclusive part of the beach which is a really nice perk staying at the hotel.

Now for the not so good. And I think it reflects other recent reviews.

The shower was either boiling or cold, and the water pressure was woeful. The toilet over flowed on first day - staff were great again but the water issues tells me that the hotel may be ageing or not been maintained.

The option of breakfast is back and front of hotel. The back option is limited. The front is great but, you have to pay for anything other than coffee from an urn. But at the back you could order any coffee you like. When I asked why, I was told the breakfast at the front was more “expensive” that the back option. Why charge your guests same amount but offer a different experience? The food was great though.

We had dinner in main restaurant one night and ordered pizzas. Expensive and not nice at all.

Another annoying aspect is the fridge did not run when no room key in slot so when you returned from a day out everything in fridge was hot.

So this is my mixed review there are aspects of the hotel I loved and aspects I hated.

Would I stay again based on current experience? No.

Would I stay again if they fixed the issues with maintenance and penny pinching re fridge, coffee in main breakfast area and maintenance? Yes I would.

To the owners, you are charging a 4 star rate for your guests please bring your facilities to that standard or reduce yourself to a lower cost base that reflects the true offering you are providing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
343,5D4N vacation,50,August 2019,"Located at suitable tourists area with great amenities and easy traffic. Stayed with 2 rooms which is great with facing nice swimming pools, clean and excellent. The staff were amazing, calm and welcome guests with beautiful smile on daily basis",The Haven Bali Seminyak
344,Beautiful hotel!,50,August 2019,"The hotel grounds are beautiful, with great pools and lounging areas. The staff were amazing, so so friendly and always ready to help. The rooms were so spacious, clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel is confidently located about a 10 minute walk to the beach or there is a free shuttle provided. Breakfast is included in the stay and was excellent, So much choice and everything was fresh.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
345,TOO NOISY,10,September 2019,"At first I thought there was a cat shelter next door but apparently it was the droning voice of their awful singer, screeching until 1.30am. Avoid this place if you want to get some sleep, and probably anywhere within a mile radius.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
346,Terrible experience!,10,August 2019,"We stayed with 2 young kids in a 2 bedroom suite for 6 nights. Every once a day I cooked some homemade meal in their kitchen for my younger one. Funnily enough, on the 3rd day soon after we returned from an excursion, a staff came in to say that they noticed a crack in their stove and blamed us for doing that. As per my knowledge I had no idea how that happened! (For all you know, their housekeeping could have done it and blamed us!!) But since we couldn’t prove that, we agreed to pay an additional amount of 2 million rupiah during our checkout. On top of that they asked us to sign a consent form saying that we agree we have broken the stove. We refused to sign because we believed that we did not. But they asked their security guards to block our car until we signed their form!!!! We have paid for their damage..doesn’t mean we need to admit we did it!!! Never again will I enter that hotel again!!!!!! Totally ruined my bali experience!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
347,Great rooms and location,30,August 2019,"Great rooms and location but the drinks extremely expensive, food very average for what they charge you.

Another issue is the light that comes in through the bathroom window, there is no way to stop it from coming in at night so it's extremely annoying having that light up your room all night.

Staff as is the norm in Bali are fantastic!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
348,Horrifying experience,10,August 2019,"I reached my hotel on 26th Aug,2019 at 18.00hrs and was standing at the reception for 45 min before I was handed over my room key. We had music disturbing us until past midnight. On the 28th night I again was booked for another night, the air conditioning wasn't working and I had to call the reception and housekeeping atleast 7 times before someone came after I asked to change the room. I am still waiting now for the past 15 minutes waiting to know what is in store for me. Most conveniently located hotel but I think they take customers for granted.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
349,Not as nice as it used to be.,30,August 2019,"Starting to look tired and dated, even a little unclean. We stayed in 2 bedroom suite.
Probably wouldnt stay there again unless price was reduced.
Included breakfast was awesome but other meals average.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
350,Would never recommend,10,August 2019,"First day in Seminyak and we booked The Haven in advance thinking it will be its own oasis in a bustling city. Oasis it is not.
Me, my husband and our baby have been tripping around Bali and most of the time staying in average accommodation not paying premiums but always receiving amazing service and the accommodation always exceeded our expectation... except for The Haven.
We booked in and the lady asked if we wanted a room with 2 single beds or 1 king. Obviously we asked for a king. After 5 mins she said sorry we have no kings available until tomorrow so you have to stay in a 2 single room until then. Which is very inconvenient moving with a baby. She then put us in a room road side. Which again with a baby is a nightmare. I immediately went downstairs to ask for another quieter room, which they proceeded to give us. Why did you not give us that in the first place?
The room is tiny! We could hardly fit our luggage in, let alone a baby cot. I went back to reception and asked to upgrade (will happily pay) again they had nothing available even though online The Haven had a 1 bedroom suite available.
The restaurant/bar at night is so noisy, the live band carries across the pool through the hotel let alone the noise from the pool and road.
Rooms are tired and in need of updating.
That being said the 7 nights booked turned into 1 and we decided to move beachside.
I would most certainly not recommend for families or couples wanting a relaxing holiday.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
351,Highly recommended and would love to stay again,50,July 2019,I love that the it felt like a 5-star experience from the moment that we checked in at the hotel. We arrived here after enduring the horrifying traffic from the airport and was very impressed with the pool view room. The breakfast in the hotel was one of the highlights of our stay as they offered amazing options every morning- buffet and ala carte. We really enjoyed the swim in the pool as well.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
352,Shabby and disappointed,20,August 2019,"The Haven has been a favourite of our for a long time, we’ve tried to ignore the dates and tired interiors - but this last trip was truly disappointing. First of all, most importantly we love the staff who give such great service and always with genuine friendliness.
The sheets and pillows are so soft and I’m tempted to take them home with me.

We stayed in the suites and would expect a better standard than the front of the property. Sadly we may be thinking of looking elsewhere to stay in the future. The coffee table is disgusting, the bins need to be thrown out, the stains on the kitchen can’t be cleaned. Too many issues to mention.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
353,Perfect location for us,40,July 2019,"We had a 2 bedroom suite which was spacious and very clean. Fantastic beds and nice decor with a big balcony.
Great location in the middle of everything and a short walk to the beach.
Lovely buffet breakfast with omelette and separate pancake/waffle stations (the girls working on these were lovely and friendly). Massage with Sumi I highly recommend, she was amazing!
The resort has a lovely relaxed atmosphere and it very unpretentious. It wasn't a 4.5 star in our view but it had a lot going for it.
The only annoyance was being bothered by cleaning staff every day. We were only there 8 nights and all we needed during our stay was fresh towels and toilet paper. We didn't want our room made up. We like it the way we like it. We explained this and yet everyday we would receive a note under the door and a night time phone call to see if we wanted our room made up. We couldn't understand why they kept doing this. We even had a man and woman follow us to our room on our last night who then brought it up with us directly at our door. I said if we wanted it to be done we would have asked
Slightly spoiled our stay",The Haven Bali Seminyak
354,Relaxing... It really is The Haven you are looking for.,50,June 2019,We love coming back to The Haven every time we are in Bali. It is super relaxing and the staff are so helpful and cant do enough for you. It also has a fantastic restaurant where you can sit one level above the traffic watching the world go by while looking across an infinity-edge water feature drinking some great cocktails and enjoy the buffets they specialise in.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
355,Fantastic and value for money,50,August 2019,"The hotel has superb location ,the staff was also well behaved ,the rooms were clean and comfortable ,the breakfast
buffet was fantastic . Some good live music event was also held .Highly recommended bang for the buck property.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
356,Nice hotel in a great location,30,August 2019,"I have stayed at the Haven twice previously, this trip I booked a suite as there were three of us.
The ground floor suite was a good size and set in a quiet, rather tranquil part of the hotel complex.
Pros: Reasonably priced. Excellent central location in Seminyak. Large suite.
Cons: although the suite was clean and modern, the bathroom wasn’t that great. Poorly designed layout, taps and shower. The kitchen had minimal amenities, would be better if utensils, pans, toaster etc were in the room.
Another con would have to be the slow service.... friendly staff just no sense of prompt service.

Overall I probably would stay elsewhere next trip as I wasn’t blown away with this place.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
357,Wouldn't stay again,20,August 2019,"Our room wasn't available so we were downgraded, we pre booked the holiday 6 months in advance. The room we stayed in had a dirty feel to it, the type you wair thongs in the shower it felt like a cheap hotel. For a 4star hotel its not this rating at all, all the photos online are Photoshoped. All we received was a complementary drink $3 worth and a smile and we are sorry from staff.

The buffet breakfast and bar overlooking street was excellent and why im giving this 2 stars

We ended up moving hotels in the end",The Haven Bali Seminyak
358,"In middle of market place, not a great place.",30,June 2019,"I stayed here for 2 days. The hotel is located in the main area in Seminyak, close to beach. The whole location is crowded, full of vehicles and traffic jams, which gets worst by evening. If you want to stay in market area, near to shops, this hotel could be for you.The rooms are bit old, not so great washroom and toilets. We had the one on ground floor, dark and not so comfy. They have nice pool.Staff is great, sweet and always smiling. Breakfast buffet has numerous good options.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
359,Central hotel in Seminyak,40,August 2019,"Hotel is in the middle of the busy Seminyak which is a good half hour from the airport. It is a large hotel spread over a very long block that takes a good five minutes to walk from the front to the rear. Hotel rooms at the front, suites at the rear and villas in the middle. There are at least three good swimming pools and two restaurants on site (serving the same average meals).
We booked a suite at the rear which contained a large living room and kitchenette (no cooking appliances) a large bedroom and separate bathroom with bath that was a bit tired.
There is a ten minute walk to the beach plus a shuttle bus that runs four times a day to a small reserved hotel area with chairs and shades. Onsite there is a health spa that offers massages etc however just outside the front and back the price is less than half what the hotel charges. Taxis and hire cars are available at the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
360,"NOISY, POOR SERVICE, WRONG ROOM",10,July 2019,"Booked this place and paid for a double for five nights at time of booking (a few months out). On arrival the hotel advise us that there is no double room available (albeit we had booked and paid months out) so offered a twin room (2 tiny single beds) for the first night and then move us the next day to our actual double room. However on day 2 we couldn't move into the room until 3pm as that was 'check in time'. Even after our travel agent spoke with the hotel, nothing was done to compensate us. Don't bother staying here, from someone who usually doesn't take the time to provide a review!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
361,Do not stay here,20,July 2019,"On our first evening, the hotel accidentally charged us twice for our booking (4 nights of accommodation), and when we asked for the amount that was incorrectly charged to be refunded, they said it will taken 14 days. Because of this, we were then out of pocket hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the rest of our trip - so unfair and such a huge inconvenience! We are back in Australia now and still waiting for the money to come back into our account. I’m really hoping it shows up soon, but I’m not convinced that it will be refunded at all. The hotel is in a good location (proximity to the beach, shops and restaurants) but there are next to no activities for kids at the hotel, the food is overpriced, and the rooms are dated and run down. The first night we stayed in a room at the front of the hotel and hardly slept due to the loud music from across the road and drunk people yelling. The remaining nights were better at the suite side of the hotel, so if you MUST stay at this hotel, ensure you have booked one of the suites.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
362,Bali was our worse vacation,10,July 2019,"We were fooled by all the ads and cheap deals, but it's just that, a dirty place with cheating merchants to foreigners, hotel was terrible not like the Photoshop pictures, staff don't speak English and everyone expects to cheat you because you are a foreigner. Cheap furniture, dirty showers, rats in our room. Hotel management is good at saying sorry but that's all you can expect, and to make matters worse, we all got food poisoning from dirty foods.. washing hands does not seem to be part of their habits.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
363,Noisy,30,July 2019,"Check in was easy. Pool area nice, however, could do with a few more sun lounges as it does get packed.

Restaurant was very expensive for bali, food was just warm and very average- i would not eat here again. However, buffet breakfast was good.

Staff were so lovely and helpful with everything!

The rooms are a good size and were clean , however, could do with some maintenance. The tiles were all cracked and there were some mouldy joins around the bath and between bathroom tiles.

We were initially on a roadside room which was very noisy- loud music, street noise etc. We asked to move and staff were lovely and accommodating and sorted us another room further along the hotel. That did not stop the noise however....there is a nightclub across the road which blares music until 2am every single night of the week. We did not get any sleep during our stay because of this! If i were to come again I would try a suite at the back of the property but definitely wouldn't stay in the front section/haven rooms as it is not relaxing and makes it a very exhausting holiday!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
364,"Nice hotel, slow service, and average aircon",40,July 2019,"We stayed here for 5 nights as a family. The check in service was incredibly slow, slowest I’ve ever experienced. So was pool side food service.
We didn’t use room service as figured gojek would be quicker and better value.
The aircon couldn’t get the rooms to a cold enough temperature so you were sweating getting ready to go out, and I woke up hot at night.
I would go back, but would love to see these improvements.
We also requested one room with a double bed, and the other room two singles, but only got two doubles, no big drama but not ideal.
Our kids loved the breakfast buffet, and the day spa was nice.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
365,Family Holiday,40,July 2019,"We have just concluded a holiday in Bali. The group consisted of two grandparents, me being one, two daughters, husbands, and four grandchildren aged 17, 14,14, & 12. We all had a suite each, we had a one bedroom and the others two bedroom suites, which were large with plenty of room giving a large lounge area for everyone spread out. The staff were excellent and very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. The Hotel also was accessible by wheel chairs which we unfortunately had to use.
The only negative comment I would make is the shower over the bath is a bit difficult if your mobility is not good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
366,Not all that great,20,July 2019,"Currently still at this hotel and have been for a week. It's no where near as good as it would like you to believe.

When we arrived the fridge and one of the lights in our room didn't work and there was a crack in the bath tub. Fridge was fixed the next day, light has only been fixed today (a week later) after the 3rd time of asking; and today they offered to move us to another room because of the bath. Given that we've been there a week, moving to another room is pointless as we'd have to pack our stuff up again. If it was an upgrade as an apology then that might be different. Speaking of upgrades, i did email them to ask about the price of an upgrade and they never got back to us.

Numerous other gripes too but don't want to list them.

It isn't bad, but it's not great either",The Haven Bali Seminyak
367,Small Complex - big rooms - in the heart of Seminyak,40,July 2019,"The building is small, but the bedroom are big, especially those located in the ground floor as you have access directly to swimming pool area and your terrace feels a lot bigger... located in Seminyak busy street hence traffic can be a challenge .. walking distance to the beach, nice bfast area overlooking the Seminyak pedestrian.. it is relaxing, the staff are great and super friendly, typical Bali people.. the rooms however need a bit refurbishment.. it is a bit run down ie stain on the mirror and counter tops... but really not a major issue.. this is a good hotel !!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
368,Modern hotel,40,May 2019,We stayed in haven suite for 2 days...hotel is huge...close to beach and bintang supermarket... breakfast was good...rooms are clean and modern...also mc Donald's and kfc is near min cab fare only..loved seminyak n location of hotel,The Haven Bali Seminyak
369,Trully Naturally Elegant,50,July 2019,"First of all, I stayed here as a mystery guest for one night to do a site inspection. My experience was all good, from the reception, bell-boy, room, breakfast, shuttle to the beach, and check-out.

All ticked, then, I decided to have my company's event here for 3D/2N with a total of 35 pax. Ms Ernita, the guest service manager really helped me with extra miles effort and flexibility in changing in the last minutes. Started from rooms, transportation, meeting arrangement, dinner up to arrangement with outside partner/vendor.

All have been taking care-off, from the airport pick up all the guests who were coming from different cities/countries/schedule, setup and rehearsal meeting equipment, backdrop etc, they even threw a theme decoration at our welcome dinner with fire-dance and other performances!

The location is perfect for our guests, as they can go walk for shopping, and it's nearby restaurants/pub, etc including 10 minutes walking distance to the Seminyak beach (though The Haven provides a free shuttle).

The meeting room set-up was very good and professional, all amenities complete including wifi, sweets and flowers, great snacks for coffee-breaks and efficient buffet lunch in between.

The staff are so genuinely kind, helpful and professional. From the receptionist, GRO, all the way to the bell-boy, F&B staffs, to the security; who helped me cross the busy road and get me the 'real bluebird taxi' anytime we needed.

The room we stayed (some of us in Deluxe, some at Haven Suites) were nice, clean and spacious. Love the balcony, especially at the Suites, so big with the day-bed! The hotel also accommodates my request for one of our VIP guest to have her room in a pitch-black and zero noise to help her sleep:).

The hotel has 2 entrance; one from the lobby and at the back with 2 restaurants each, so we can have breakfast at any of those two:) Very generous breakfast, lots of yummy food, from Indonesia/Bali food and western as well.

The villa Gabas I stayed was very lovely! Spacious indeed, with a huge salle de bain, hot tub and private pool.

What can I say? My stay and our event went successfully. One thing, I really appreciate was the natural and genuine service to made my decision in choosing The Haven as an event venue, so much worthy.

Matur suksma to all the staffs and the management of The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
370,GREAT PRICE IN A GREAT SPOT,40,December 2018,"I have been staying at The Haven now from almost its beginning.
Although its getting a little tired, its still a great place to stay for the price.
The staff are amazing, hats off to them all for their friendly, smiling service. Nothing if is ever a problem. They respond fast to any needs, or to things that may need a tweak during your stay.
I have stayed in the suite side and the hotel side.
The suites are super spacious, I would highly recommend for a family as you can book an adjoining room and the suite becomes a 2 bedroom.
The hotel side is great for singles or couples.
The price of your stay includes a buffet breakfast. Not the best I've eaten, but it's the convenience of having it! I always find something.
Your kids will love the waffle and pancake station!
Theres 2 pools, both with kid friendly sections.
Its only a 5 minute walk to the beach from The Suite end of the hotel.They also run a shuttle to the beach.
The Bintang Supermarket is a 3 minute walk from The hotel side. Great to know if you are travelling with kids, plenty of snacks to keep them going through the day.
Overall a great hotel for the price.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
371,Lovely place to stay,50,June 2019,"Great place to stay, friendly helpful staff. Situated in Seminyak, a short walk to the bus stop and supermarket. Rooms have a safe, are clean, very nice.. Beds are lovely to sleep in. Buffet breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
372,Paradise at Reasonable Rate,50,July 2019,"Bali is such a beautiful spot, and the area near Double Six Beach is ideal for surfing and relaxing. The Haven supplies an ideal place to call home during your stay; I was blown away by the room's spaciousness.

Hospitality is a priority at this resort, and the breakfast offers the most variety and quality that we've had during our weeklong visit.

They also have a resort sponsored beach site--look for a small sign next to a larger beachside hotel spot.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
373,A very pleasant stay,50,July 2019,It was our first visit to Bali and I'm glad we chose to stay at The Haven Bali Seminyak. The hospitality was part excellence. The rooms were neat and well made. The breakfast buffet was diverse and truly a gastronomic experience. Will definitely visit again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
374,Haven more like Heavan,50,July 2019,"The accommodation was perfect on all aspects. Walking distances to many street stalls, many restaurants and the beach. The staff were wonderful and all very helpful. Taxis right outside the hotel which made things very easy.The restaurant down stairs also made dining very easy as well.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
375,Second Stay - just as perfect!,50,June 2019,"On our first stay at the Haven we stayed in a Suite. This time we took the whole family and booked the Villas. We had 2 x one bedroom villas and the 2 bedroom villa between 8 adults and 2 children. The villas are some of the most amazing ones we have stayed at in Bali (holidayed in Bali since 1996). They are so private with very high walls so you don't hear the next villa. They are very large, with a separate sitting/tv area which can be converted to another bedroom, separate main bedroom area, enormous bathroom with huge sunken bathtub and 2 showers - one indoor and also one outdoors, a separate kitchen area and wardrobe area. Each has it's own pool which are quite large, which is fantastic as a lot of villas in Bali just have small plunge pools. in fact the 2 bedroom villa has 2 separate pools over 2 levels! Once again we were so impressed with the resort from the beautiful gardens to the restaurants to the amazing day spa.
Breakfast is buffet style, with the suites and villas using the back restaurant Lemon Cello and the hotel rooms using the front restaurant. Plenty of food choices available
Location wise, fantastic right in the middle of it all. Bintang Supermarket is not too far (about 5 min walk from the front entrance) to stock up on a few supplies and the beach about a 10 min walk from the back entrance. There are also the usual numerous shops and stalls and restaurants right outside the resort.
The Haven Staff are fantastic, so friendly and helpful, and we must thank again the very lovely Ernita for looking after us so well during our whole stay. Also to Sugi - your themed restaurant nights are great, and Riyani both at Lemon Cello restaurant - thank you both for looking after us and our family!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
376,Ideal,50,June 2019,"The Haven is in a great location and the place is huge. We stayed in a one bedroom suite for 2 nights which was massive but a very long walk backwards and forwards to the main entrance (if you are old) Communication was not so good with the staff on reception, our check out was extended to 2.00pm but when we got back to the room at 1.00pm we were locked out and had to make the trek back to the reception again. but they are lovely anyway.
The swimming pool in the main area was great with plenty of lounges and with the sun on the water. The other 2 pool's were shaded all day (for some ok). They had different buffet dinners throughout the week, we had the mexican, which did not have a great variety. The cost was ok but we had wine which made it more expensive. Buffet breakfast every day was excellent.
We had a massage and facial in the spa which was wonderful, as usual a bit more expensive than outside the hotel but worth it. We would stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
377,Haven in name ... Haven in reality,50,June 2019,"My wife and I had a wonderful 16 night experience having recently finished our holiday. We stayed in the suites at the rear of the complex ... fantastic 1 bedroom suite ... wonderful room, however if you are getting on in years (as we are) the accessibility to the shower - which is in the bath - is quite restrictive. With this said, the staff were amazing ... friendly, attentive, kind and warm ... say hello to Sugi in the rear Lemon Cello Italian Bistro ... and the Guest Service Manager - Ernita - was very attentive in helping us with our next holiday booking next year.

100% recommended! Love it! And yes, we'll be back ...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
378,Exploring Seminyak ? This hotel should be very good for you,40,July 2019,"Room are OK, Breakfast OK, Ambience OK 10-15 minutes walk to the beach, they also provide shuttle to the beach, while they also own their private spot beach at seminyak. It also surrounding by night attractions",The Haven Bali Seminyak
379,Awesome service,50,July 2019,"Just went to the haven for family holiday. I have booked the two bedroom suite. We came in a bit late to the hotel. When i checked in, the two bedroom suite was not available. To our surprise, they have upgraded our room to the two bedroom villa.

The villa was amazing. It was beyond our expectations. This is what i call great service.

Thanks a lot the haven 👍👍🙏🙏",The Haven Bali Seminyak
380,Home Sweet Home,50,June 2019,"I'm satisfied with the service and warm welcome, especially from Mrs.Ernita, the manager of this villa. My children also love this place because it feels homie. Looking forward to stay in this beautiful villa with my family on next holiday!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
381,Wouldn’t go back,20,June 2019,"Stayed at The Haven for five nights at the end of June. Had booked a villa in order for us to have a bigger space and own pool area, and travelling with a four year old.

Absolutely couldn’t knock the villa size, we really enjoyed the space it offered and the bathroom area is lovely with great outdoor shower also. That said, we agree with previous comments that the bathrooms smell damp and mouldy.

We asked to be moved after the first night as the noise from the pool bar was unbelievably loud, in fairness we were moved the following day but was a definite inconvenience. It would be awful to be based from the front pool area rooms as there would be no reprieve from the music during the various events throughout the week.

The spa is lovely; good therapists and the wait time for an appointment is pretty short and it’s open until 10pm.

Despite what is advertised, there is no regular kids activity sessions. We asked for four days in a row and was only on the last day was saw a staff member next to a kids garden slide and beading with some string with a small child. The advertised babysitting service was also not available all week.

Front desk staff, whilst very polite are a team of disorganised and confused members of the team. Very vacant when asked questions and we struggled to get what we needed on a couple of occasions. There is no visibility leadership here at all and when checked out of the hotel, a couple were speaking with the front desk staff about wrongful advertising and demanding a manager; very awkward for the staff member.

We also had some clothes laundered and have realised that one of the dresses has been shrunk in length significantly.

Good and drink are just above average, the prices for local beer are what you’d expect and have just over 100% mark up on the supermarket cost. A pizza is about the same price as AU as a regular meal in the hotel as expected.

Lastly, there is a very basic kitchen in the villa so cooking for yourself if you have a young family or alternative needs is difficult. No microwave or oven, just two gas rings and a very cold fridge freezer. Our food in the fridge was frozen on some days. Also no cloth to wipe surfaces or spills in the kitchen and asked a member of housekeeping to leave one for me when they made up the room.

Overall, not a place we’d go back to. There is better value and location for Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
382,Not the best but not the worst,30,June 2019,"We stayed here for 6 nights when we first arrived in Bali. Having read reviews I expected quite a decent hotel and that was accurate. However I would say on a cleanliness level it could have been better. The rooms had a slightly damp smell in them (we had two rooms as they didn’t have double bed available for first night) as if they had been shut up for a long time. We think it was because the air con wasn’t working properly, it seemed to be leaking. The hotel itself is pretty modern and has good facilities, a nice pool although could do with some more sun loungers, and a good gym. Overall though I would say it is looking tired round the edges and could do with a spruce up. They did a breakfast deal for people staying there, around 65K rupiah per person for the buffet which was great value...omelettes, pastries, noodles, cereal, pancakes etc.
All in all I would say not a bad hotel, but for the money you could find better in seminyak. We stayed at Jambuluwuk hotel in seminyak when we returned there later in our trip and it was a similar price and much better in my opinion.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
383,Mouse is Turning 50,50,June 2019,"Checked into The Haven for a 4 night stay before heading to Ubud for a few nights and then back to The Haven for a night before heading home.

Spoke to Desi on reception about leaving our bags whilst we went to Ubud. Desi was an absolute pleasure and nothing was too much bother for her. It makes a nice change to have staff that go out of their way to assist.

Thank you Desi for all your help and assistance!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
384,no place better than this hotel,50,June 2019,"Located in the center of the city. This hotel offers a great experience to stay!
The staff was great! Front office is willing to help. Thanks to Febby for helping us. They offer you help without doubt during stay. The room is clean and it has peaceful atmosphere. The restaurant at the ground floor was my fav part.
The shuttle going to the beach is a good facility that we can enjoy in this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
385,Amazing experience,50,June 2019,"As i checked in to the hotel, the front desk welcomed us very warm. The check in was smooth. During stay, the service from the staff is excellent. Febby was looking after us. The housekeeping take care of our room very well. The free shuttle going to the beach is also great to help the guest reach the beach club. Check out was no problem. It went well. Thank you for having us and we certainly will come back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
386,Very Nice Hotel in Seminyak,40,June 2019,"We were very happy with our stay at The Haven. The hotel grounds are designed really well with beautiful landscaping. Our double room was on the top floor with good air con and a nice view over the main pool. However, there were a couple of nights where music from Jaan Bali (a nightclub/ bar venue across the road) was so loud that it could be heard into the early hours of the morning. Rooms towards the back of the hotel probably would not be affected by this.

The hotel breakfast is buffet style with a great choice of food. There is also a fantastic spa - Atma Spa - which offers amazing massages! Note: be sure to take advantage of the hotel’s pre-arrival discount price which they tend to email to you before you arrive.

Don’t forget to make use of the hotel’s private beach club area on Double Six Beach. They provide sun beds, umbrellas and towels free of charge and every time we used the beach club there were loads of sun beds available!

The Haven is in a great location to walk to Double Six Beach and surrounding restaurants and shops but however is a 30 min walk to Jalan Kayu Aya (aka Eat Street). This may be worth considering if you wish to be within a closer walking distance.

Overall a very good stay at The Haven and great value for money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
387,Lovely ambiance as always,50,June 2019,"My honey told me, last time he's saw another guest is complaining about the room or bed , I thought it will be same on us, Unexpectedly.. We've got upgrading from standard to suite room.. Just lucky or what a blessed 😉 #thankingGod #thankingthehavenseminyakmanagementandservice so lovely 🍀",The Haven Bali Seminyak
388,Love love love it!,50,June 2019,I love this hotel!! So beautiful and the pool is lovely. Great Central location. The staff are wonderful everyone always smiles at you!! The staff asked me to join the pool yoga which was lovely. I recommend the Ubud blizz cocktail! Great job everyone we would love to come back!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
389,Mostly good but too family friendly,40,June 2019,"The staff here are second to none. Absolutely lovely and very competent. The suites are lovely (very glad we upgraded from a basic room) but the only problem we had was the sheet of glass that almost covered where a bathroom wall should have been. We aren't the kind of couple that likes to watch each other on the bathroom so we found this uncomfortable. The rooms are well cleaned for the most part but have some grime in the bathrooms that seem to be too far embedded to get out with a regular cleaning service.

This hotel is spilt into 2 sections. The suites, which area a bit quieter but more family friendly (and therefore sometimes not that quiet) and the basic room section which seems to be full of more youngish people out to have a good time.

The breakfast was ok. Perfectly adequate given where we are. But nothing spectacular by Western standards.

The spa is amazing. We've been back a few times now and are going back again today. Would highly recommend.

Overall, it's been a good stay given the price we paid.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
390,Great Place Excellent Location,50,June 2019,"I thought this hotel was great value for money. its not 5 star but you dont also pay 5 star prices. Staff are brilliant, everything is clean. Meal prices and quality are also quite good considering it is a hotel. The beach is a 10 minute walk and they have their own lounges and area at Double 6 Beach, right next to a cafe.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
391,The Suite rooms are tired and really need updating.,20,June 2019,"My husband and I stayed in suite room 0212. The floor tiles were seriously cracked in several places. The bathroom bench tiles and bath tiles are seriously stained and black spots surround the bath taps and can't be removed. There is adequate ventilation so it's hard say why these dirty looking stains are present. The shower is over a very wide, deep set bath. I found it a little bit hard to enter the tub without careful hand holds and foot placement. In a nut shell I thought it a dangerous slip risk. On asking for a change of room or a solution I was provided with a rubber bath mat and a step. This certainly helped however I would prefer not to ever have to go to these lengths for a shower.
The best thing about this hotel for me was the location and the shuttle to an exclusive beach area for hotel guests.
The staff were courteous and helpful as Balinese people most often are. There seemed to be a large number of Australian tourists staying here and it made me wonder why as I would never choose to stay here again. There are so many better places to stay which cost a lot less.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
392,Jennie157,50,June 2019,"Wonderful hotel. Beautiful service! Very serene and quiet. Was upgraded to a suite which was amazing. Thank you to DWIRP for your generous hospitality!! My first choice always in Bali ✔️✔️ beautiful rooms, pool and first class service!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
393,Best Holiday,50,June 2019,"We were there for a short holidays. They upgraded our room to 2 bedroom suite. What an excellent experienced we had. Thank you. Highly recommended room for a family holidays.. Pool view with balconies.
Breakfast was superb with variety of choice from local to international.
Outstanding staffs performance with knows exactly how to treat their guests.
Thank you and surely will come back... Thank you The HAVEN Seminyak!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
394,Great Hotel,50,June 2019,"So we began our holiday in Bali by staying at The Haven - Seminyak for 6 nights. The rooms are clean and well presented, the beds are comfortable and spacious. We were given a nice room overlooking the pool, with a balcony. The room seemed to have a slightly musty smell to it when we first arrived however that is to be expected with the climate, once we'd switched the air conditioning on for a few minutes it was fine! The staff at the hotel were very friendly and collected our suitcases upon arrival and delivered them to our room.

The breakfast was good, there was a variety of options to choose from, you could have chicken sausages, beef sausages, pork bacon, eggs (cooked to your tastes), a wide range of fruit juices and coffee available, I recommend trying the cappuccinos there or the iced chocolate drinks! The fruit selection was fairly limited to melon and pineapple, but there was plenty of different foods to try. Including different types of rice, and mie goreng - along with other Balinese food. Croissants, bread, cakes, fresh pancakes all included also! We didn't have breakfast included in our stay, but we paid every morning around 65,000 idr - which we felt was good value for money.

The pool area was nice too - there was always a couple of helpful staff at hand if you wanted to order and drinks or food by the pool. However, we would say that sometimes if a lot of people are staying in the hotel around the pool that the sunbeds can become quite limited.

The location of the hotel is good - there are a fair few restaurants to eat at. Our favorite around that area was Café Marzano - check them out! It's located on the road leading to the beach from the hotel. The beach is close to the hotel which is a bonus, it's roughly a 15-minute walk and there are plenty of nice shops and little cafés on the way to look at.

All in all, this hotel really stands out from its surroundings. It's in a nice location and it's perfect for those who are trying Bali for the first time and want to ease into the whole experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
395,Serious pest problem,10,May 2019,"I really hate to give bad reviews but I feel like I need to here. We have walked through The Haven many times on our way through Seminyak and always thougjt it would be a nice place to stay. So when my friend was getting married in Bali and wanted somewhere for all of her guests to stay after the wedding I suggested we stay there. I was pretty embarrassed that I had suggested The Haven in the end. They have a serious rat problem. The first night we attended the (awful) pirates of the carribean buffet which I was seriously worried someone would get sick from. I saw a rat running through the tables. The next morning I woke up to fresh rat poo all over our towels which were drying on the balcony. We then noticed rats in the temple eating the offerings (yes there were squirrels but rats also). The last night we were there I had to kill a massive spider (looked like a huntsman but bigger) in the bathroom. I think the issue is the food waste everywhere. Cleaners don't pick up plates from room service. Ever. You see old plates everywhere outside of rooms.

The rooms were also filthy. Really dirty. We had a 2 bedroom suite and the kitchen bench was so dirty. As if it had never been wiped down. It put me off of eating there. Our airconditioner was also broken (leaking massively) but I couldn't be bothered moving rooms so we just kept the lounge area airconditioning on and our door open. Wouldn't stay there again and would warn anyone off staying there.

To The Haven - please sort out your pest problem. It's really bad.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
396,We had a pleasant experience,40,June 2019,"My wife and I have just returned home after 10 nights staying at The Haven Bali Seminyak 28th May to the 7th June. I must admit after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I was slightly worried as there was roughly 50-50 good and not so good reviews before I booked. As usual when writing my reviews I give an honest opinion on our experiences, so here goes.
We were given a room on the 1st floor near the pool bar. The room was far better than I expected with a comfortable king bed, great bathroom with a rain shower and shower hose, all that you would want for your stay and a daily cleaning service.
We found every staff member to be very polite and respectful especially the staff in the restaurant and on reception.
We only used the 2nd pool at the back of the hotel it was much quieter except for the other Australians who decided to bring their own loud music machine which we all had to suffer with their choice of music.
My only real concern is the noise from early morning staff getting ready for the day at the pool then the guests swimming early with their children can be quite noisy.
One night a group of older women where drinking, laughing/talking so loudly that it felt like they were on our balcony and of course got worse as they drank more alcohol. The next night they started up again until a staff member approached and spoke to them, the noise became acceptable after that.
We attend the theme night Pirates of the Caribbean which we really enjoyed and the food was so good. We had an hour massage each which was just so relaxing.
We had a couple of minor maintenance issues which was attended to very promptly.
Air-conditioning in our room was so good, didn't need to have it on overnight and with my ear plugs and some early unplanned mornings managed to sleep well.
Breakfast was included and there was such a great variety to choose from you would be very hard to please if you didn't enjoy the food and there was plenty.
The location is perfect a lazy 20minutes to the beach and we walked to Kuta twice 45minutes one way for us, there are many great restaurants close by which to choose from.
My last comment is, to let you know there is a amount of 155,00 IDR you have to spend to sit at the front of the restaurant as this stops guests sitting there all day in the best seats without buying food or drinks, this is not added to your bill I think this starts from 12md to 9pm. Also be informed that there is a government and service tax added to everything you buy 21 percent at hotels and at restaurants and bars outside of the hotel 15 percent, this is so the government of Bali have the money to improve the infrastructure across the country.
We did enjoy our holiday at The Haven Bali Seminyak even with all the noise going on, mostly not the fault of the hotel and like all good businesses its the staff that makes the difference.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
397,Dissapointing stay,30,June 2019,"We chose the Haven especially the Haven Suites due to its location and this did not change as we previousally stayed in this area close to double six beach. Checkin smooth and nice bell person to take us to our suite. Location great first floor overlooking great pool area but unfortunatly thats where it stops. Great spacious one bedroom suite furnishing old but dated clean few cracked tiles, the airconditioning smelt mouldy but the bathroom was awful.Broken cracked tiles with gaps that were black and mouldy uneven tiles at the entrance to bathroom and ground in dirt around fittings. Shocked we decided to suck it up as if we got shifted maybe no better. On the plus side staff, breakfast, pool area at the back, bbq night were terrific. You could find better accomadition at better or same price. Sorry management of the Haven as we did have a nice stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
398,Terrible customer service,10,June 2019,"Arrived at this hotel with a reservation made on AirBNB, upon arrival the check in staff told us they had no record of the booking and proceeded to ask for all manner of personal documents including scrolling through my husbands online banking. They offered no assistance nor had any contacts for their listing on Airbnb, Yosua in particular was extremely unhelpful, switching between Indonesian and English when he didn’t want to be understood. Considering the amount of money we were spending with them, it was the worst customer service ever received at a hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
399,"Outdated rooms, untrained staff",10,May 2019,"Booked 2 rooms with friends. They got upgraded, we didn't. Can't understand why, as the hotel wasn't busy at all. Never mind, our room was right next to the pool so we didn't mind. But it we could smell mould so we kept the aircon running all day.
Very outdated furniture, poor finishing on walls and doors. Rusty bathroom cabinetry comes off exposing rusting nails; toilet paper holder loose (see attached pictures) The bathroom was very humid, no ventilation at all. Shower recess didn't seem to be very well cleaned.
Funny placement of power points and phones - no power points in some bathrooms and phones on desks rather than next to bed.
Restaurant was very expensive: $AU90 for steak, vegetables and fruit juice for two people. Breakfast was quite ordinary as well and not abundant. Our deal included one buffet dinner and massage for two. Massage was good but buffet dinner consisted of COLD chicken and beef skewers. When we complained to staff, they said buffet hours were from 6:00 to 9:00pm and it was 8:00pm and they were already packing up, hence the cold food! Nevertheless staff prepared more hot food for us but we were left wondering what would have happened if we didn't complain? Most probably we would've had a cold dinner.
There was a note in the room to let us know that the hotel was undergoing renovations until the last day of our stay coincidentally. Just two nights before we were due for check out, the builders worked ALL NIGHT LONG just on the floor above our room. Hoping that they would stop at midnight, I waited to see what happened. At 2:00AM they were still going so we could hear banging, drilling, the workers shouting at each other. So I called the reception desk and demanded another room on the other side of the hotel, which they promised to get ready at 3:00 that afternoon! Lucky for the hotel we were going out early on an excursion that morning! Where on Earth do you have a hotel doing renovations all night???
Then my friend's son and her girlfriend arrive to the hotel to find out that there was no breakfast included with their reservation, and that they were given a room similar to ours but even more smelly. After more than ONE HOUR arguing with the hotel ""manager"", they got upgraded to the suite area but only after paying more $$ (their room was already AU$90 when booked!) So they arrived at this suite to find many floor tiles cracked, my friend's son cut his foot! After yet another discussion and wait, they are transferred to another suite....
Hotel staff were OK overall but some needed more customer service training and language skills.
Next time I'm in Bali won't bother with The Haven - will go straight to the Baleka just around the corner, that IS a beautiful hotel indeed!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
400,Amazing Experience,50,May 2019,"Would highly recommend staying here, the perfect place to relax and also see Seminyak. Customer service was incredible and every aspect of the hotel was perfectly suited to our needs. Breakfast was great and staff friendly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
401,Toilet smell,40,June 2019,"Just checked out of room 4019 today and we have stayed there are 3 nights after given a free upgrade which we really appreciate.

Unfortunately, the toilet in this room smell really bad. We have feedback from the first night and the toilet still smell sewage until the last day of our check out.

It’s really bad, we have to hold our breath to use the toilet. The door has to remain close to reduce the smell going into the room.

Eventually, we gave up and use the toilet downstairs near the lobby instead because the smell is so bad that it’s quite unbearable for us.

Overall the bed is comfortable, breakfast and service are great.

Just avoid this room even though they mentioned it’s just renovated.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
402,Family holidays,40,May 2019,"We are so grateful that we stayed at The Haven. You would never imagine that as you came off the busy street and entered thru the main entrance that a peaceful & beautiful traditional Balinese tropical environment lay before you.
The place had four pools that catered for adults and children alike. We came with our two children so we had booked a family room which was connected with a lounge room. The rooms were of good size and had balconies with day beds with views over the pool areas. The only issue we had was one of the rooms had the shower over a high bath tub so you had to take extra care that you didn't slip when getting in or out. Also the shower pressure wasn't the greatest and the drains were a bit slow to expel the water but did the job. The balcony wooden doors were sometimes difficult to lock.

The buffet breakfast was good with a variety of food to cater different nationalities and the fresh juices were refreshing.

The staff were very welcoming as you would expect from any Balinese hotel and nothing ever seemed too much trouble. Everything was done with a smile.

The location was fantastic with a short stroll to Double Six beach and Bintang supermarket. There were also numerous stores and restaurants within close proximity. If you wanted to go a little further out, a taxi drive to Kuta or Seminyak Square would only cost between $2 -$4 aud.

We paid for a buffet dinner for one of the nights and we were entertained with some traditional Balinese/ fire dancing. It was a great experience and
the hotel really went out of the way to provide for the guests.

Overall, a great time was had and we would definitely consider staying here again and recommend to others.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
403,Nice hotel to stay,50,June 2019,"The hotel is very beautiful and the villa is amazing. The staff is very friendly and helpful! I recommend to anyone in Bali. Thank you so much the reception especially Arya! And also the hotel located at center Seminyak, so easy to explore..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
404,Great food at a reasonable price,40,May 2019,"Had a buffet breakfast here with all you can eat
The staff were attentive & very friendly
The breakfast had a huge selection of fruit to hot foods & plenty of it
Fresh food cooked in front of you such as eggs & bacon 👍👍👍

Very happy & sat over looking the street 👍👍👍in the fresh air
Will be back again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
405,The haven,40,June 2019,"Not a bad hotel by any means. Most staff were polite and accommodating. Some were a little rude. 1 of the pools gets no sun what so ever. Other pool gets sun all day. Buffet is good, rooms are clean and orderly. Pool drinks and food are ridiculously expensive though.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
406,Last stay for us.....,20,June 2019,"We are currently staying at The Haven Suites and thankgod it’s our last night. This is our 3rd time stayin here and whilst the previous stays have been fine this one hasn’t. The noise from all the drunks at 1.30am every morning sitting outside near the pool and screaming and carrying on is ridiculous, security have been called on 3 occasions and only appeared once. (A lot of family’s not happy with the noise and been on balconies yelling out at these drunks) Every morning at 6am the trolleys start going past the suites I assume to the breakfast area and just make so much noise clunking along the path then every couple of days you have the pool being cleaned at 6am and the staff feeling the need to have a chat outside the rooms whilst this is done, don’t stay here if you want sleep!!!
Like previous posts we are also dissapointed in the rooms, starting to get very old and need an update, curtains are see through in areas, floors are all cracked, couch is terrible the cushions that are supposed to support your back don’t have any padding left in them so are useless, cupboards falling off hinges, lacking basic utensils ie teaspoons, had to buy a bottle opener!!
To top it off y’day I watched a staff member drop a punnet of strawberries off a tray which landed in the kids pool, he just picked them all out and emptied the water out and put them in the drinks fridge 🤦🏼‍♀️
The positive would be the breakfast it is very nice and a great selection.
Not sure where the high rating comes from, probably looking at a 3 star at best...Unfortunately this will be the last stay for us.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
407,Good value and location,50,May 2019,"We spent 5 nights at the Haven. The accommodation was part of a package holiday special so we weren't sure what it would be like. We were pleasantly surprised. Check in was quick at 2am! The included breakfast had a good selection. Our room on the 2nd floor overlooked the pool but was quiet away from any road noise. The room was just the basic hotel room but had everything we needed. The location was convenient to many restaurants, shopping and a easy and quick walk down to the beach. All the staff were helpful and friendly (We used a local taxi driver Wayan for all our day trips and would thoroughly recommend him . His local number is +62 878 6063 0125) Overall we would definitely stay at The Haven again for location and value.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
408,Strategic hotel & value for money.,50,May 2019,"Starting from the day we came, everything was well.
Check in was fast,no problem. During our stay the staffs are attentive. The room is clean and the breakfast is nice. Receptions are helpful and special mentioned to Febby who was always looking after us during our stay. The free shuttle to the beach was nice. This hotel is value for money. We will return for sure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
409,EXCELLENT,50,May 2019,"Our stay at The Haven js going exceptionally good ! The check in was quick and smooth . Special commends for Ms Febby , guest relation officer , she is outstanding .

411,Nice hotel,50,May 2019,Check in was smooth. Reception staffs are friendly and helpful especially Febby. The room is clean. The room is large and it fits our family well. The housekeeping staff is friendly. The shuttle bus is great making us easier go to the beach club they have. The SPA and massage was good as well. We certainly will come back. Check out is professional that they tripple check our belongings at the room.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
412,HORRIBLE HOTEL,20,May 2019,"This is not a 4 star hotel more like a 2.5 best 3 star. The rooms in the front of the hotel smell like mold and are old, the photos that you see on the internet are not what the rooms are like. My curtains had blood on them, even when I complained nothing was done about it. The floors are all cracked, the shower is moldy. Stay away",The Haven Bali Seminyak
413,Great Value,40,May 2019,"Stayed in The Haven Suites for 7 nights. Two bedroom suite was great value, extremely spacious, serviced daily, comfortable beds, pleasant and attentive staff. Breakfast buffet was extensive and catered to all tastes. Well positioned on the Legian end of Seminyak, close to many cafes and restaurants, only a 10 min walk to the beach, but the hotel has a free shuttle service if required Two pools, partly shaded, which is a huge plus in my opinion. My only criticism is that a freshen up of some rooms would improve the ambiance",The Haven Bali Seminyak
414,Great Value for Money,50,November 2018,"We chose The Haven because we wanted a good quality hotel in Seminyak and we weren't disappointed.

Our room was on the 3rd floor and overlooked the pool area. Our room was modern and was spotlessly clean. I slept well in general, except from the last night when an Australian man being aggressive to a group of other travellers for making noise by the pool.

Breakfast has a lot of good options and eggs can be cooked to your preference.

The hotel's a short walk to the beach with lots of shops nearby.

I'd definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
415,"Amazing breakfast, clean rooms, friendly staff, nice pool",50,May 2019,"Stayed here for week. Friendly staff, nice and clean rooms. Great roomservice. Amazing breakfast buffet with both cold and warm dishes, bread, desserts, omelet, bacon, you name it. Big relaxing swimmingpool. The hotel spa and restaurante is also good. All in all a great place to stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
416,Enjoyable Stay!,50,May 2019,"It was my first time in Bali and we stayed in this hotel for a total of 3 nights. The check-in was easy and we had no issues in getting our rooms. The family suite that we stayed in was spacious and clean. Furthermore, the beds were comfortable and there was no issue for us getting a good night sleep. However, the bathroom was slightly old, and could do with some better lighting.

On top of that, the breakfast was simple yet delicious and it was in a very quiet and relaxing setting. The hotel was also located in the middle of the tourist shopping district and is within walking distance to Double Six beach. All in all, we had a wonderful stay here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
417,To be recommended,50,May 2019,"This was my first stay in THE HAVENÜ. I enjoyed it very much. The check in was easy and the included breakfast was also very good.
The staff was very kind and helpful especially Desi of the reception.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
418,Great location,50,May 2019,"We stayed here few nights and it was great! Located in walking distance to one of the best Bali beaches called double six beach. On the street nearby so many restaurants, SPAs and shops, even MCD in 10 min. Hotel staff do job great, room was clean and cozy. We were satisfied 100%.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
419,Amazing,50,May 2019,"This was our 6th time staying in the suites and they did not disappoint, yes bathroom might be slightly dated but you don’t sleep in there, food good, beach club amazing as we spent all 12 days there, pool really nice and relaxing, only thing is staff holding day beds for guest for up to an hour in 1 case 2 and they never came back, spa was really good, frozen daiquiri yum, thank you Eko and staff for another amazing holiday, will be back again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
420,"Nice Hotel & staff, ruined by NIght Club nearby",30,March 2019,"Hotel is on the main street, plenty to see close by,The Hotel Resturant is very good and reasonable cost if there are evening events.
Nearby are plenty good cheap cafes/restaurants and bars.
Staff were very good, were tidy and well looked after every day.

The BIG let down was a local night club situated very near to us, which played very loud music until 3am, we were NOT warned of this by Booking agent/Travel Company or Hotel, if we had known would have asked to be relocated.

If you are elderly and dont do night clubs, then look elswhere, other than that Hotel was satisfactory",The Haven Bali Seminyak
421,Good hotel and convenient location,40,May 2019,Stayed here recently for 10 nights and was chosen because of the price as well as the option to have a one bedroom suite. It allowed us to put our toddler in the bedroom whilst my husband and I could use the lounge room and kitchen. The rooms were large and spacious and we were happy with them for the price we paid. Both pools were quite cold by Bali standards and found it was quite unsafe for our toddler so we avoided them which was a shame. So instead we used the shuttle every morning to go to the beach and use the hotel’s sun beds which were free. The breakfast was great with a good selection. We tried the restaurant for lunch once and didn’t find it particularly that great so went to other places around the hotel which were within walking distance. Overall a good stay.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
422,"Great service, food, entertainment and rooms.",50,May 2019,"Our hotel pickup was waiting at the airport and provided a cold water for us during the comfortable drive to the hotel. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite :) We indulged in massages on site at the spa during our stay which were great. We enjoyed great food and entertainment at the Egyptian Dinner on Saturday night. Breakfast was excellent, with great service from Sri :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
423,"Good value, good service, great breakfast",40,April 2019,"My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon for a few nights. We were impressed with the service from start to finish. e did the Thursday night BBQ buffet and entertainment which was nice and good value (although desserts could have been improved). The best part of our stay was the breakfast, they had everything on offer from a traditional Balinese breakfast to good old American pancakes and french toast. The hotel is in a good location and there is a shuttle every couple of hours to take you to the beach. Also, they didn't tell us but we'd seen online, the property have their own 'beach club' so look out for it. They call it a beach club but really its just some sunbeds and fresh towels - still good however and saves you paying for one elsewhere. Good property and worth the money (we paid around US$ 75/80 a night including breakfast for a standard double room). Only downside was that the water from the shower/toilet smelt bad but think this happens often in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
424,Good Hotel Location price/quality,40,April 2019,"The hotel is well located just in central Seminyak, with walkable distances for shopping, eating, and Spa. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, the breakfast is OK, nothing out the blue, but funcional. Rooms are also OK, with a terrace that I loved since I smoke. My only complaint with the hotel is the party night noise, especially during weekends, in my case, I am not really sensitive about the noise, buy my partner is, so it was an issue. Overall, is a good and convenient hotel to stay, is you plan shopping and enjoy the heart of Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
425,Fantastic family holiday,50,April 2019,"Thanks very much Hotel Haven and staff for an amazing holiday. Sorting rooms for a group of 27 people was never going to be an easy task however Eko sorted everything for us accomodating all our different room sizes and needs.

I have stayed here before and was welcomed back with friendly familiar faces again. All the staff around the hotel especially those around the suites restaurant are friendly and offer great service.

During our stay they helped with a pirate themed birthday party which will be memorable for years to come.

Having the Bintang supermarket within a 5 mins walk and quality restaurants in the area makes this a perfect place to stay.

We will definitely be back again. Massive thanks to all the staff in the Suites for taking great care of us.

Thanks again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
426,"Pretty average, affordable place to stay",30,April 2019,We stayed here almost a week. The location was great and the staff very friendly. Our room was very run down but it did the trick. We were very upset to find out on the last day of our stay they there was a whole other pool in the back along with another half of the resort unattached to our building. Not a single staff mentioned this and upon further exploring we realized this “back” part of the resort was in much better shape than the front part. Even the pool had better seating etc. We were told after the fact that we had access to this pool all along. Would have nice to have been told this sooner. The level and cost of accommodation in both buildings also appeared to be the same yet we were placed for 6 nights in the most run down part of the hotel. The food was just ok. It was nice to have so much variety for breakfast. Likely wouldn’t return or recommend.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
427,FAVOURITE RESORT IN SEMINYAK,50,March 2019,"When visiting Bali you can't go past The Haven Hotel for great value for money. The hotel has excellent facilities 2 pools one with a bar, restaurant and even its own day spa & its located on ""Legian Road half way between Legain & Seminayk .I choose to stay in the Haven Suites located at the back of the property, which is best suited for a quieter stay.
Breakfast is a buffet with plenty to choose from that being Asian – Western.
Rooms are delightfully spacious and versatile. Bathrooms are becoming a bit tired now and I have to say the shower over the bath is a problem as it’s very hard to get in and out safely without hurting yourself. I would really like to see the baths removed.
I frequented the gym on a daily basis and was pleasantly surprised how clean it was kept with fresh towels and cooled water provided.
The Hotel have allocated beach lounges on the beach in front of the Double 6 hotel ,towels are supplied and if you’re lucky a refreshing cool face towel given out by the hotel beach boy. If you don’t fancy the walk down to the beach, then take the shuttle buggy leaves from the back reception 3 times per day.
We did use the Hotel transport for our departure trip to airport very reasonably priced and much more comfortable than a taxi.
It’s the staff that really makes the Haven so amazing and would like to say a huge thank you to Mr Eko for always looking after my bookings, Febby so very friendly In Guest Relations and the lovely staff in the Spa for making our holiday so great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
428,Not new but comfortable. Good vibe and value,50,April 2019,"It’s the sort of place that works for a range of folks and families. Relaxed and attentive service, nice pools, well situated ( not near beach but good shuttle and reserved beach area) the rooms are a bit tired but work. It just worked well for the people staying.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
429,Lovely place,50,October 2018,"Used to have breakfast here thinking it would be too expensive too stay , enquired on our next trip and it was very reasonable, stayed in the one bedroom studio , very nice , great location , breakfast great , staff beautiful and have already booked for next trip",The Haven Bali Seminyak
430,Buffet great value,40,April 2019,"First time staying at The Haven , excellent buffet breakfast better than big chain hotels coffee is good and had the BBQ buffet ! Great value Sugi the manager is great and attentive ! All staff in the Pool suite restaurant are extremely friendly ! Husband can’t wait for all you can eat Ribs buffet night",The Haven Bali Seminyak
431,Great One,50,February 2019,"Stayed in one bed room, villa for 3 nights was awesome. Reservation staff very friendly, they provide free pick up at airport for loyal guest who book more than 3 nights. Welcome drinks is so refreshing, the reception is very friendly, Check in very easy and quick,
Room very large with beautiful private pool and the butler service will serve you every day with smile. Breakfast also very fantastic.
They have gym, spa and free shuttle from hotel to the beach. The tour desk was good they provide us the transport to the airport. Will definitely stay again next November.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
432,Passing beer,10,April 2019,"We were greeted by the hostess on what seemed to be a quiet Sunday evening. We were escorted to a nice table on the street front overlooking the fountain. A waiter appeared with the drinks menu, highlighted was their happy hour (6 - 7:30) special of 2 bottled beers for Irp 85. We noticed the small print on a little sign on the table that because the front tables have the best view??? A minimum spend of Rp 185000 was required, we left after 2 rounds (4small bottles) a final bill of Rp 225000. Moral is beware the small print. At around $22 for 4 local beers it is no cheaper than drinking in Melbourne. At this rate Bali will lose its attraction in favour of cheaper destinations such as Vietnam and to a lesser degree Thailand. This would be a shame.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
433,Quiet relaxation,40,April 2019,"On the plane to Bali I read some reviews regarding the haven. I had already booked but was curious what recent visitors had to say. The first three weren’t great and all of a sudden I was wondering if I made the right choice. In a nutshell, I did. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms (stayed in one and was upgraded for no reason for other two nights) were comfy, spacious and very clean. The hotel itself has two pools, an amazing restaurant and is close to the beach and most shops. Highly recommend and if I’m ever back in town, I will surely come again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
434,Great location for a short stay,40,April 2019,"My friend and I stayed here recently for 3 nights. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment and it was very comfortable. Centrally located to restaurants, Bintang supermarket and a short walk to the beach for sunset drinks. Breakfast was included and this was great value. All staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. There are several pools so quite often you had the pool to yourself. Highly recommend this accommodation to families and also friends travelling together.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
435,Wish we never booked,10,April 2019,"Wow what a disappointment. From the moment we arrived we were ignored at the reception whilst the staff were laughing amongst themselves. Finally we checked in but no smile from the lady. Not a great start. When shown our room, it was like walking into a room of disappointment! The 2 bedroom suites are very rundown and need urgent maintenance. I can’t believe we paid $270 per night to stay here, it was like a 2 star hotel standards. Black marks all over bathroom floors, mould in sink basin, kitchen bench covered in stains and sticky residue, mirrors peeled. To make our stay worse, our aircon was broken, our room was boiling hot. Hours later after requesting a new room, we were finally moved. The new room was exactly the same, filthy and run down.

This hotel is not good for kids, there is no kids club, the back pool is too cold, the front pool is full of adults who whinge when children are having fun. If you have kids, please do yourself a favour and book somewhere more kid friendly.

Breakfast was the best part of the stay and even then, it was average. Coffee wasn’t great, luckily there is grain cafe across the street.

Would not stay here again, nor would I recommend this resort to anyone. Sorry but there needs to be serious maintenance repairs in the rooms.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
436,Old worn out resort,10,April 2019,"On entry walked for ever to room on entry to room refused to stay advised no cancellation.we booked via last minute deals.
After trouble of finding new hotel and requesting refund ,strongly suggest not to book via last minute or Haven resort .Experience ruined the trip.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
437,Spacious,40,April 2019,"We stayed in a villa. The rest of the family stayed in a suite. The rooms in the villa and suites were so spacious. There was plenty of room for the children to spread out in. The kitchens were very good. The furnishings and decor were lovely. One suite had an issue with hot water, but the others were trouble free. The staff were all very good and courteous. Before we went, we saw a lot of reviews saying the pool was cold. We didn’t find this at all. The breakfast was good. It is in an excellent position, costing only a couple of dollars to go to Kuta by bluebird taxi. The negatives were few. The main one being the slow service in the restaurant, and waiting for staff to fix an issue. After experiencing the slow service in the restaurant we ate out at the restaurants nearby, which there are plenty.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
438,Superb,40,September 2018,Great hotel. Local amenities close by . Staff were very welcoming and couldn’t do enough for us . Room was very clean and price is reasonable. Only ate her one night but the food was great also . Couldn’t fault this place and would return,The Haven Bali Seminyak
439,Third time here and won't return,30,April 2019,"This is our third time staying at this property. Previously we stayed in the one bedroom villa and could not fault it. This time we stayed in the most expensive room time and the service we received certainly did not met the amount we paid for the room.
Check in was basis, no staff even offered to escort us to our room. We were giving a key and told to head to our room when we were ready.
Upon arrival to the villa, it was very tired and in need of some attention and love. On the first night there was a storm and water came in under the doors and flooded a part of the room.
Staff didn't seem like they wanted to be there, not willing to help or go that extra mile.
Disappointing stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
440,Sabeen Restaurant,40,March 2019,"We looked around Seminyak for a decent place to eat and this was the best, lovely staff.
We went on 2 nights that had buffet meals, such good price. My husband and I wished we had stayed closer but the walk was good to and from there as where we stayed was through the Haven to other entrance so was nice quick walk once we realised it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
441,Location and staff are the best bits,30,March 2019,"The location of this hotel is quite spot on but it's definitely showing its age. Those air conditioners helmed in by dirty looking cages, those unwieldy heavy balcony doors and dirty corners in the bathroom are signs things need freshening up and housekeeping standards raised. On my last night, there was a temporary power outage just after dinner time, which is a little unacceptable because there didnt seem to be any emergency lighting for the walkways and corridors. The staff are what prevented me from downgrading this hotel further. Very friendly and attentive. Good selection of food at their breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
442,Not a Haven at all,30,March 2019,"We stayed in this hotel during our 10 days trip in Bali. We decided to stay in Seminyak during Nyepi celebrations, so we can see the show. The hotel stuff and service is good, however they could have informed us that they have a transport to the beach and that they actually have their own beach club in Double Six Beach. But they never did and we had to pay in the beach for the sunbeds and umbrellas. Later we discovered ourselves that there is a dedicated beach. That was really disappointing.
We took breakfast at the main restaurant one time only, and were not feeling well after that. So in general the experience was not really good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
443,Worse hotel we have been to.,10,April 2019,"The Worst hotel we have ever stayed. Before booking the hotel I did some research and was pretty satisfied with the reviews and the pictures on Agoda The public areas in the hotel looked exactly the same as the pictures on the website however the nightmare began once we entered our room.
As we entered in to our room, our expectations were completely destroyed. The photos posted on Agoda was misleading. The room floor was disgusting there were liquid stains all over the tiled floor. The bathroom was worse, it was filthy and smelly there were black stains on the floor tiles in the bathroom. Once we complained to the reception they gave two keys and said we could go and choose which ever rooom we want to have. So we had to walk around the hotel for 25 minutes looking for a clean room . The other two rooms were not worse as the first room we were given however it was dirty( the sheets had stains, the curtains had mould on it. The hygiene was zero. Once I showed the pictures to the staff at the reception the respond I was given was “We don’t have any other room available this is what’s available”

It is disgusting how the hotel could expect a paying guess to sleep in a dirty and moldy room. I was extremely disappointed and will never recommend this hotel to anyone.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
444,Price ripoff,10,March 2019,Two glasses of wine which barely covered the bottom of the glass. Paid 23 $ . Bottle in the bottle shop 230$ does not make sense. Do not recommend for value for money. Other places better for wine. Indicated our displeasure but shrugged off as if this is their norm. Won’t go again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
445,"""The Haven Heaven """,50,March 2019,"After my husband and I have just returned from a 17 day stay in a 1Bedroom Villa at The Haven, we are already anxious and excited about returning again.
We are regular visitors to Bali and this is by far our preferred accomadation. From the moment we arrive to the moment we leave we are made to feel so very welcome. Staff are amazing, it offers great facilities, good clean pools ,its in a good location , it's clean and comfortable and it's all worth visiting the Haven.
The grounds are very well maintained, it offers a shuttle service to the beach(5min) where guest have a dedicated area to the resort, and it's beautiful.
A very big thank you to Riyani, Ayu and Yogi for greeting us each morning with a smile and with excellent service to start our day on such a positive note. To Kaden Suryantini and Ratna for cooking us a delicious breakfast each morning.
And lastly to our beautiful and attentive Marcel, Made and team for not disappointing us once again with your amazing service in our Villa. Everything thing is so detailed ,personalised and you all do such a wonderful job. We have never experienced the service that you do to make us feel so comfortable anywhere that we have stayed whilst travelling.
And lastly to all Management and staff, we can't wait to see you all again in September 2019 for our next 20 days, and also May and November 2020 . You all should be so proud with the service you offer to all your guest staying at the Haven. Well done 10/10",The Haven Bali Seminyak
446,Strategic Location in Bali,50,March 2019,"The Hotel location is strategic, easily accessible from the center of the city the Bali. At night walking, looking for food, shopping is very easy. The Rooms are clean and comfortable, friendly and fast staff respond.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
447,a wonderful place to stay,50,March 2019,"When you enter this hotel you will first see the restaurant in the front position before the lobby. I stayed for 2 nights there. On the first day I stayed in a 2 bedroom villa type with a private swimming pool inside. This type of villa is perfect for staying with friends or family because the rooms are very very spacious. The next day I moved to a 2 bedroom suite type room, this room was no less good than a villa type room. I could see the sun rising from the balcony of the room. And to see the sunset I just need to walk towards the double six beach which is right behind the hotel. The location is very strategic for shopping as well because on each side of the road there are many shops that sell souvenirs. The hotel also has 2 fairly large swimming pools. All staff are very friendly and very helpful. The breakfast menu is quite varied. I will definitely return to this hotel if I vacation in Bali. Thank you The Heaven for very satisfying services and facilities.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
448,Always really love the Haven Seminyak,40,March 2019,"It was my fourth stay in Bali at the Haven Seminyak and as usual I felt right at home there. The staff are really nice and helpful. The location is really great and close to everything in Seminyak. The rooms are nice with good air con and the pools are also lovely. The style of the rooms and the amenities are great, the house keeping there is very good so they are always clean but some general wear and tear about the place is starting to show just a little. The food is ok and people come just for the buffet breakfast but I think the food could be slightly improved. Still it will be my go to hotel again next time I visit Bali. It’s a great hotel all in all and I would highly recommend it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
449,Average hotel in Seminyak,30,March 2019,"Nice hotel in central Seminyak. Easy to walk to shops and restaurants from here. The Haven Rooms are run down and some TLC is needed. Do not stay in these rooms unless you like to be kept up until 3am with the music from the club across the road. Upgrade to the suite rooms to be away from the noise. The suite rooms also run down and some care is needed. The pool down by the suites is a nice quiet pool, where as the main pool is busy with lots of kids. Breakfast is good with a wide selection of foods. The buffet dinners are pretty average. Overall a good hotel if you are on a budget.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
450,"Central location, great service and helpful Staff!",50,March 2019,"We stayed in one of the Villa suites at The Haven resort and it was sublime. We originally booked a regular room which, when we arrived, seemed a bit worn. When we enquired about upgrade options and they showed us the Villa suite we were blown away! The large private pool, outdoor shower, gorgeous bathroom and tons of space sold us! We moved. The hotel grounds, spa, restaurant, and the amenities were lovely. The Staff at The Haven were all amazing! It's not in the best part of Seminyak, but only about 10 minutes from upscale shopping and restaurants. The Caffeine Coffee Shop is a 5-minute walk and we had our morning coffee there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
451,Good Option in Seminyak,40,March 2019,"We stayed in a suite here for one week for a ‘budget’ holiday. The hotel is well located for restaurants and bars and a 10 minute walk to the (awful) beach.
The hotel is a little tired but the suites are large and comfortable. The buffet breakfast is good and service very warm and friendly as you expect in Bali.
Overall, a good option without breaking the bank.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
452,Dining,40,March 2019,Atmosphere and food is like a pub so if you’re looking for a restaurant try elsewhere but if looking for a nice relaxed place To watch the world go by them this is it. Food was good quality and cocktails were good.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
453,"Not bad, but not great",30,March 2019,"Friendly and accommodating staff. Room was a bit of a let down, given the price. Pool is lovely and at a refreshing temperature with no shortage of sun beds. ""Doof doof"" music from nearby clubs is hard to sleep through at 3am. Excellent breakfast, lots of variety - but the hotel restaurant is quite pricey by Bali standards.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
454,"The Haven Restaurant, Seminyak, Bali.",40,March 2019,"Had dinner here quite a few times, found to be very good (safe).
Check the days as they have all you can eat buffets two or three times a week which are great value. Around $13.50au each.
I tried the seafood buffet and was suprised at how nice it was, but was expecting after effects the next day (Bali Belly), have to report no sign so was indeed a lovely meal.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
455,Just plain bad...,20,March 2019,"From the outside the hotel is nice. Nice lobby and attractive decor, but once I got into my room I was really unhappy. The room was disgusting. Cracked floors, ants all over the counter and sink, moldy shower, leaking toilet. Pathetic for a “four star hotel.” The room service is also a joke and subpar at best. The only plus of this place is the staff, they’re all very friendly. That being said, I cannot WAIT to check out tomorrow and never come back as I don’t feel comfortable in my room at all...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
456,Bali heaven,50,July 2018,"Beautiful place amazing at sunset, very unusual setting being in a rice field. Incredible food.Service great , people really friendly lovely staff , lots of homewares to look at. Easy to get to via cabs if not staying nearby.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
457,Nice hotel to stay in,40,March 2019,"This hotel was really nice and centrally located within Seminyak. It is close to the local shops and a 5 minute walk from the beach. The only reason it hasn't got 5 stars is because we booked a double bed for our trip and when we arrived, we were given a twin. This was rectified quickly and we were given a double bed the next night.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
458,Great Property in Busy Seminyak,50,November 2018,"I spent two nights in a hotel room at The Haven Bali Seminyak. The room was nice, clean, with a TV and a glass door into the bathroom/shower. The room included a balcony and I had a view of the large hotel pool. The bed was very comfortable and clean. Breakfast is offered in the hotel via a large buffet spread. The hotel is located along a very busy road in Seminyak that has a large offering of shopping, restaurants, and bars and is also a short walk from the beach. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, affordable hotel in the heart of Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
459,Great place to stay,40,March 2019,"Clean and well appointed rooms, friendly staff, good breakfast buffet offering. Restaurant can be a bit pricey but similar to other hotel restaurants. Central location.. 10 minute stroll to the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
460,great holiday in Seminyak,40,March 2019,"We stayed in The Haven from 02/03 to 09/03/19. The beginning of the stay was not promising, when we arrived we noticed that the fridge was not working, however after one call, the maintenance staff arrived and replaced the fridge. We stayed in the one bedroom suite and we enjoyed the stay there. The food was great, therefore we did not bother to have any meals outside the hotel. The biggest asset to the Hotel are the people who work there. Thank you to Sri, Sugi and Howard, they made our stay in the hotel very special.
We would like to come back. Snezana and Branko",The Haven Bali Seminyak
461,Large hotel in central Seminyak,40,February 2019,"We had a private villa. This was by far the best option. Very private, very roomy, very gorgeous private pool. The villa was sprayed for mossies every night and the bed had a large mosquito net so no problems with them. The bathroom was extra spacious and supplied with crystals, candles and bath spices. The toilet seat rises as you enter automatically. What a hoot. We entertained friends who were also staying in the hotel and this proved to be a great venue to do so.
Breakfast was comprehensive and included European, Indonesian and other cuisines. There are two other sizeable pools in the hotel. The steps down into the courtyard where these pools are can be an obstacle, especially if wet...use the elevators in the hotel to get to this level.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
462,worst hotel so far,10,March 2019,"I was staying with my team work from the office at suite 306-307 during nyepi holiday 6-8 march 2019, then extend my stay with my baby boy until march 11. they gave us room 0012 near the pool, no hot water, no dust bin in the room ( I need to ask for it ), the shower wall leaking and I almost slipped. I complained then they move us to 1018, stil there’s no hot water in the bath room and no dust bin in the bedroom, they didn’t even refill the tissue paper after the housekeeping clean the room. I’m not gonna stay there again and won’t recommend to my friend and family",The Haven Bali Seminyak
463,6 nights at The Haven Feb 2019,50,February 2019,"We booked one of the private villas and i cannot say anything other than it was amazing. From Ougie the smiling and friendly hotel driver who picked us up at the airport to all the amazing hotel staff who made sure we were well looked after. The villa was clean, quiet and spacious. Breakfast was plentiful with lots on offer. I fell in love with Bali and the people and will definately be back. My only gripe ( and this is nothing major) was the lighting in the bathroom. Once it got dark it wasn't easy to put your makeup on however i am sure the lighting reflected the ambience of the hotel...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
464,Great location,50,November 2018,"The 2 bedroom suite was perfect for myself and my 2 sisters. Location great as just a short walk to the beach and shops right outside. Hotel was quiet itself but as soon as you step outside, the amazing hubbub of Bali is on your doorstep. Food was great in the 2 restaurants. Swimming pool lovely and cool.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
465,One of the best hotels in Bali,50,March 2019,"Fantastic hotel with very friendly and attentive staff. Huge pool, clean comfy rooms and the best breakfast buffet! We were here for Nyepi day and it was great, they did a small class to teach how to make the little offerings that Balinese people do everyday which was great. Highly recommend this hotel!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
466,Excellent service.,50,February 2019,"My friend and I stayed here for 5 days in February. I have Expedia VIP, and this was a VIP hotel and it definitely met the standards. We received free breakfast, credit towards the spa, and even a free upgrade. The suite itself was big, the soak in tub was hard for my friend and I to get in and out of. The only thing to complain is the lighting in the room- my friend and I tried doing our make up and it was just hard with the lighting being so low. Also when we were trying to do our hair there was no available outlets near mirrors so we resulted in using our iPads. The service and the staff itself was amazing however. They always greeted us and were available and always wanted to help us in anything that we needed the best service I received in any hotel in a very long time. I definitely would stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
467,"Sugi and Sara, we thank you!",50,March 2019,Really relaxing time and felt very welcome. I highly recommend Sugi and Sara from the Lemon Cello Haven suites for their true and genuine professionalism; nothing was ever too much to do and always with a smile! Thank you to both of you and all the kind staff that made our stay so special. We will come back!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
468,Overall nice stay,40,January 2019,"I stayed here in early January in the Haven room, queen bed, so this is a late review. The room was comfortable and everything worked as it should have. The bathroom could use remodelling, but it was fine. The pool is nice and gets the sun for a good portion of the day. I ate in the restaurant for one supper meal. No complaints.

For Expedia VIP + booking I found they fell short. They provided a one time voucher for 150K IDR for the restaurant and the same for spa services. Other more expensive Expedia hotel VIP bookings regularly provide a room upgrade and free breakfast. This was disappointing and for this reason I would likely book at another VIP hotel instead.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
469,"Would stay here again, but might ask for a room further away from the lobby",40,March 2019,"Lovely hotel, very modern and stylish, my room is great, and I’ve been staying here for a week. The main pool is very nice, it gets the sun all day in various places, and it also has a basketball net at one end which is fun. The breakfast is great - loads of choice, and other food is good but pricey compared to other restaurants around.

Only two minor complaints: being in a room close to reception has its downside as I’ve heard people setting up at 6am onwards out by the pool and in the lobby every morning - it seems to echo along the balconies. Secondly, the laundry service is very expensive here but I found a little laundrette (Adhi Laundry) on the second left turning that’s considerably cheaper as they weigh and price by the kilo. All my clothes came back nicely folded and smelling lovely.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
470,A favourite friend,50,February 2019,"I have been staying here on and off for several years now, and am still pleased with the hotel on each and every visit, the value for money is incredible, and the facilities are better than you would normally get for the price. With such a central location you would think it would be noisy, but once inside the hotel, it is peaceful and relaxing. They are currently renovating the suites and some of the rooms, which I have to admit are in need of a minor spruce up, but this did not affect my stay one bit, and I even got to have a look at one of the finished rooms, which looked simply beautiful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
471,Winter's Holiday,30,July 2018,"Wow, this hotel was fantastic, there are so many features inside this hotel. But the price is so expensive,so you should keep your money in piggy bank before check in here. But if you have much money, it's okey to check in here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
472,Very satisfied! 🤩,50,December 2018,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my friends, we were very satisfied to stay here. Nice pool, great location, has balcony, big room and good breakfast too.
They upgraded our room too to the suite without paying any extra! 🤩🤩
Definitely will stay here again when I visit Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
473,Perfect Location to start the Honeymoon,40,February 2019,"We stayed at The Haven to start our honeymoon off before we moved to Ubud. We stayed for 3 days which we felt was more than enough. That is no slight on the hotel just we felt that was enough for Seminyak.
The hotel is everything the website and pictures suggest. We stayed in one of the suites nearer the back of the property away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. The Room was massive and had everything we could ask for. We didn’t use much of the pool but having several meant I was more than ideal.
All the staff were very helpful.
Location wise the hotel is ideal for the beach, local bars and shops.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
474,A comfortable stay with great food option,50,February 2019,"I stayed in The Havens Bali Semniyak for 3 nights and 4 days. It’s one of the best properties in Semniyak. I stayed in a superior room, which was huge and very spacious with a balcony and pool side facing. The washroom was very clean and spacious. The staffs are very polite and nice. Swimming pool is big, nice and clean.
The best part of this hotel is their restaurant. They have some amazing Balinese authentic dishes in their menu plus they keep having some nice barbecue nights. Trust me for the 3 nights, I didn’t go anywhere else for dinner and had it in The Havens and the food is cheap.

I would recommend this hotel to everyone. It is well located and connected. You will easily get scooter and taxi from here and a Semniyak beach is walking distance from here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
475,"Location, Location, Location - Seminyak Sensation",50,December 2018,"This is our 4th time staying at the Haven in Seminyak and we love it. It is so close to everything, including numerous shops, boutiques, the beach, restaurants and bars.
We stay in the suites as they are very spacious and located at the rear of the hotel so it's quieter. This time we stayed in a 1 bedroom suite as it was only the 2 of us...they are large with plenty of room to just hang out and relax. It also has a kitchenette with a full size fridge so we could keep our food, snacks and drinks cold as the Bintang store is only a short stroll away! It's great having a separate lounge and bedroom if someone wants to have a nanna nap in the arvo!
There are 2 restaurants on site where you can have breakfast. The main restaurant Sabeen offers a wider range for breakfast choices, however, can get a little busy and noisy as it is at the front of the hotel...didn't worry us. The other restaurant Lemon Cello is at the back of the hotel, where it is quieter. It also offers breakfast, however, not as many options. It is overlooking the pool and greenery which is really relaxing.
The staff is what makes this hotel. There are so many that we could tell you about however let us tell you a few. There is a very special person we would like to make mention of and her name is Riyani and she works in the restaurants. She is the most wonderful person, always has a smile on her face, willing to assist, oh so friendly and a true gem. We met her in 2016 for the first time and every time we head over we always catch up with her. The other person is Ayu and she also works in the restaurants. Once again always has a smile on her face, loves a chat and always willing to help. Eko at reception is also great and very helpful. We always book direct with the hotel and Eko is always willing to assist with any requests that we may have.
The grounds are very well maintained and there is always plenty of room for all the guests in the pools. There is a shuttle done to the beach where guests have a area dedicated to the resort. There are lounges and towels available here and is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
476,Many facilities on site,50,February 2019,"My wife and I stayed 6 days / 5 nights at this hotel and were very impressed. It is in a great location with numerous shops, bars, restaurants and 24 hour mini markets nearby. Conveniently there is a registered money exchange opposite the hotel. The breakfast was excellent with many choices to suit most tastes. The staff were very helpful and courteous. We had a problem with our room safe but within 10 minutes of being reported it was fixed. The site has excellent pools and a spa which my wife visited. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
477,You cant perfect perfection,50,February 2019,"My wife & family stayed in the 2 bedroom suit & it was amazing ,the room was very spacey with 3 tvs through out .Staying in the suite enabled us to have a separate swimming pool at the back of the property as well.
as a restaurant so I would highly recommend it for a family as well as couples .The staff never stopped smiling & there was nothing they wouldn't do for you ,well done staff .
I would also recommend getting the breakfast when you book as it is outstanding ,with plenty of bacon &eggs as well as other food ,we stayed from sat 2 feb till 10 feb",The Haven Bali Seminyak
478,Would definitely stay again !,50,January 2019,My family and I have just returned from a 6 night stay and would definitely recommend this resort. We stayed in a suite room which was much larger than we expected. The bed was really comfortable and the TV's had a lot of channels (some resorts only have the basic channels). There were good sized swimming pools and many lounging seats so it was not too busy at the pools and we could really relax. We loved breakfast ! The buffet breakfast had lots of options and the staff even served us cappuccinos. Thanks so much to Sugi and Ryani who were so friendly and made us feel so welcome. We also greatly appreciated the wonderful service we received from Housekeeping when we needed extra cleaning/towels. The resort is in a great location - close to the beach with lots of vibrant shops and restaurants around two sides of the resort. It is also just a $5 taxi ride into Kuta. I can't wait to stay there again !,The Haven Bali Seminyak
479,Good location but,40,February 2019,Location is perfect for shopping and dining but the hotel rooms are bit old however well maintained though. Swimming pool and other areas are clean . The spa is nice as well . The breakfast could be better. Overall nice hotel.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
480,Perfect stay and perfect environment,50,February 2019,"Cooperative staff special mention to the lady managing the breakfast buffet accommodating our vegetarian food request
Courteous staff right from checkin to security personnel.
Highly recommend this place
Very well located

Just one suggestion: pls change the door locks they seldom malfunction",The Haven Bali Seminyak
481,Disappointed,30,February 2019,"I really appreciate the cheap rates but I am not happy about some aspects of my stay. For a start I requested a non smoking room but was disgusted by the smell of smokers being in the room, it was fairly obvious that it was in all the fabrics in the room. The balcony had an ashtray on the table. The air conditioning didn’t work, when I spoke to staff they gave me another card and advised to leave it on all the time. The room I had was near reception and it was very noisy, dogs barking and work men using electric tools were an issue. Still a good hotel for the price, make sure you get a room away from the front of the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
482,Enjoyable stay,40,January 2019,"We came here for our honeymoon and stayed 6 nights. The first thing you notice is the very busy street just outside the hotel, which we enjoyed watching while having a drink on our first day.

Everything is close buy with very nice restaurants. The people are really attentive and make you feel really welcome with their friendliness.

The rooms are well built, clean and very quiet even though it is a busy area. If you chill by one of the pools you also don’t really notice the streets or noise.

The only slight issue is that they are currently renovating some of the rooms which can be irritating when by the pool.

The food, drinks and laundry can be a bit pricey, but there are many alternatives a quick walk away.

The bed was nice and big and their internet is really fast. One day we were feeling a bit sickish so we streamed a bit of Netflix.

Breakfast is average, they have a good variety but I just did not have the stomach for all the food. I would rather pay breakfast when there than include it in the booking.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
483,Great stay,50,January 2019,"First time staying at The Haven, really enjoyed it here. Location was great, room was clean, tidy and a good size, room was attended to every day and the staff were kind, friendly and helpful. Pool was great, kept clean and good temp.

Would easily book another stay here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
484,APPEALING TO THE EYE,50,January 2019,"Check in was a breeze. Staff were friendly and welcoming.
We had two Haven rooms and decor and feel was fantastic. Remember if like us, we only use the room to sleep and get ready to go out.

PROS
- Close to everything Bali has to offer
- Shuttle to beach comes in handly when hot
- Great resturants close by (Check out Tommy's Cafe and Cafe Marzano)
- MiniMart and Parmacy across the road
- Trustworhy money exchange close by
- Amazing spa for massage at The Haven

IMPROVEMENTS
- Lighting in bathrooms were very dim
- Music around pool is definitely needed
- Buffet dinners lacking atmosphere

Thank you Haven for our holiday",The Haven Bali Seminyak
485,Lovely Stay Again,40,January 2019,"Once again enjoyed staying here with our two teenagers in a two bedroom suite which is at the back of the property. Pool is very shaded so not great for sunlovers. Very quiet hotel with not a lot of interaction (ie no pool games, swim up bar etc) so if that’s what you are after this hotel is not for you. Full size fridge fantastic because you can just buy your snacks and drinks from circle k or the like. Shower over bath not ideal but you have a walk in shower attached to the other room. Staff were all lovely. Massage at their spa was ok but I was taken up to a single room away from the spa so kind of lacked the same ambience. They are trying to run some special dinner nites but I don’t think they were being very successful which made me sad for the food manager. Will probably stay again mainly due to the room set up and location and lovely staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
486,Long waited stay,50,January 2019,"My wife and I already spotted this property since long time ago every time we are taking holiday to Bali. The Haven Seminyak always became one of our options. Finally we have made it on our last Bali visit. We visited Bali few days after new year 2019. The property fulfilled our request for ground floor room (one bed room suite) which was lovely. Slight incident happened during our arrival that our bellboy obviously were trainee (it was written on his name tag), he even confused to which directions he will took us to our room. But it was not really bother us much. We rent a car during our stay and never had a challenge with the car park at the property. Short walk to double six beach which were good advantage for us. Room was lovely with great amenities. Breakfast was lovely and not to crowded though the hotel was fully booked I guess. Swimming pool near by our room were nice. I personally never bother the long walk from lobby to our room. Overall our stay was memorable and definitely will be back again if we have chance. All the best!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
487,Best trip to Bali,50,July 2018,"Looooooved it. We’re in the middle of it all, if not Golf cart trip to beach and $5 taxi ride to eat street. We just loved this hotel, stepped out on the street for shopping and either free golf cart ride to double 6 for fantastic pasta or $5 ride in taxi to eat street.
We just loved the location, if you didn’t want to venture out you didn’t have to because you could still afford the great food in the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
488,Underwhelmed,30,January 2019,"We booked this hotel as I had made a mistake with some dates on our other accomodation and needed a one night wedge! It was selected based on its great location on a major shopping street in Seminyak and because we had stayed at the Haven in Canggu.

The good
1. The location
2. We got an upgrade to a 2 bed suite which was a nice surprise (I had booked 2 x rooms).

The not so good
1. Massive hotel = long walks in and out
2. The cooling in our room was terrible and we had maintenance out 3 times to look at it. Our room remained hot well into the night and with a sick son this was not ideal. We spied an old air con unit near the lifts the next day with our room number on it! Clearly it was faulty and replaced.
3. Great to get a “free” welcome drink but when I went to use it was told could not have a coffee! I then got charged over $6.50 AUD for a very sub standard cafe latte!!
4. The standard rooms are tired and looking a bit shabby. The faux throw rugs on beds are not nice I would imagine a breeding ground for bugs!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
489,1 Bedroom Villa 607,50,December 2018,"First time staying at the haven.Villa was perfect and exactly like the photos and very clean with plenty of room.Buffet breakfast was wonderful, plenty of choices and real bacon. Staff are very friendly and helpful.Only down side was the price of food and drinks, I know this is a resort but come on $5.00 for bintang. Would consider coming back if prices were lower.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
490,The perfect place to stay!,50,January 2019,"My partner and I have just spent 7 nights at The Haven in Seminyak. Upon reading some other reviews and seeing some of the pictures on their website, I was hesitant at first to book there. After our time there though, I am so glad we made the right choice and can’t wait to go back!!

The hotel is situated along one of the main roads in Seminyak. We found this great as it is close to Minimarts, some nice places to shop and excellent restaurants. The front of The Haven does get busy as it is a bar/restaurant, but you can easily escape this!

The hotel is a lot bigger than I expected. It has a couple of pools, one at the front and one down the back. The hotel is a lot quieter down the back where all of the villas are along with the day spa. I would recommend booking a room further back from the street.

We stayed in a one bedroom villa at The Haven which was the a great choice! It has its own pool which allows for more privacy when soaking up the sun. The room appeared to be well maintained and very clean (and I am a very picky person when it comes to this!). The cleaners came each day and even sprayed our room for mosquitoes from time to time.

During our stay we had the buffet breakfast each morning which was fantastic. It had so much variety and each time we ate there the food was still warm and covered well. We also used the hotel’s free shuttle bus to the beach where The Haven has a private sheltered beach area you can use. The hotel offers transfers to the airport, however we did not use this as it is a lot cheaper to get a taxi each way (Maximum 100,000RP).

All of the staff were always very friendly and would help with any questions that we had during our stay.

I highly recommended staying at The Haven in Seminyak!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
491,"Overall good value, huge suites, yet decor needs a refresh",40,January 2019,"Managed to get a suite at very short notice (when airbnb fell through) for our family of four for five nights for an exceptional rate! On check in we had mixed feelings as the hotel isn't a patch on its namesake (Haven Suites) in Canggu in terms of looks, condition and facilities wise (except also has excellent service) where we had just spent 5 nights.
In its own right The Haven Seminyak is a decent hotel with lovely staff and a gorgeous tranquil pool area at the rear where the suites are. (Its a very long hotel so if you are checking in to a suite ensure our driver takes you to the other entrance!).
This hotel is almost right on the border of Seminyak and Legian and close to Double Six Beach. We appreciated getting the shuttle down to the beach (5 minutes in shuttle) many times to walk along the beach for 30-40 minutes at sunset ending around La Lucciola. Breakfast was good. Room service and general pool side dining options could be vastly improved inc PLEASE add more vegetarian options. Many buffets had nothing at all for fish or veg eaters (No, side salad is not amain meal!) The suite itself was literally massive (room 310 & 311) on a great corner with expansive views toward the ocean with glimpses. It also had its own large lounge room plus two bedrooms. However there needs to be maintenance for the dripping a/c unit, improvement to the dated look and feel and change of stained tile floor and bench tops. Do recognise this will probably add to cost though. Was told the rooms at this hotel (vs suites) have been upgraded although didn't see any inside and the villas from the outside look positively lovely. A shout out to the kind and attentive staff. Yogi at breakfast each day with his beautific smile was typical of the warmth emanated by all staff.
Tip -Sacred Grounds cafe very close by for local quality meal.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
492,Enjoyable Stay,40,December 2018,"We enjoyed our stay of 10 nights from 24 December (3 x rooms). The hotel rooms were serviceable, would have preferred a suite or villa but these were all booked out months in advance. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good and the grounds and pools were very nice. The gym needs to be larger as I gave it a miss when there were any more than 2 people as it was that tiny. The location was excellent with lots of good places to eat and shop az well as spa treatments nearby.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
493,Great hotel and location,40,January 2019,I love staying at the haven we just had our second visit. Rooms are fairly clean no real complaints there. Staff are amazing food is pretty good too cocktails are great. I raised this with them last visit the showers are awful they are either hot or cold no in between. It’s very hard to rinse shampoo from your hair in boiling water. I would give them 5 stars if they could sort this out.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
494,Good location.,40,January 2019,We only stayed at The Haven for the last 2nights of our 8 day Bali holiday.We were on the third floor.Band aid wrapper on bebroom floor and wet toilet paper on floor beside toilet on check in!Balcony view looked onto a roof.Street noise heard in room.Staff very pleasent.Breakfast not too bad.Plobably a nice place to stay if you were on grond floor or at least had pool view.Very nice pool.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
495,Not good for lunch.,20,January 2019,"We stopped in for lunch. Waited awhile for order to be taken, then an hour for food to come. Only to be told after an hour that the chicken burger was not available. We had tacos and a club sandwich. Not good. No taste.
There is a pond near the restaurant which caused there to be many flies.
We won’t be going back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
496,Family getaway,10,December 2018,"Staff are amazing and beautiful and caring.

Two bedroom suites are not very clean and when we arrived had food and hair all over the floor and in the bedrooms.
The room are big, but tired and need renovations.

The hotel is adequate, meals are cheap and the pools are ok. The facilities are ok, but gym is tiny, don’t bother.

Ended up with food poisoning on our last day of a ten day holiday from the breakfast box, so DO NOT ORDER ONE. Two of the five ended up at the doctors upon arrival home and confirmed same. Bed for a few days.......

It was my second time there and unfortunately, last.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
497,"Lovely hotel, perfect base.",40,September 2018,"I visited here with a friend for 2 weeks. When we first arrived we were asked to hand over a deposit this wouldn’t have been an issue if we had of been told prior to arrival! However you were able to use this on spa treatments whilst at the resort so we did this.

The first room we were given was very close to reception and after long travels we were kept up with noise from the reception (the room was literally next door). We could even hear the phones of the reception staff going off. The next morning we went down and explained and they moved us (even moved our cases when we were on a trip). The next room was higher up and a lot quieter.

The hotel host a number of theme nights with a buffet and entertainment for very reasonable amount of money! The staff were very friendly and even remembered our drinks order and no ice from one of the party.

One of our party is gluten free and the staff often helped by speaking to the chef and making special dishes or adapting dishes. They did have gluten free bread although the niceness of the bread varied. One day there might be ‘bread’ and the next what appeared to be rice bread, however I got use to this over the 2 weeks. They did there best to accommodate and always walked me through the buffet to let me know what I could eat.

The hotel has an onsight spa, it was very relaxing, cheap and the ladies were lovely. We used the spa twice through out our stay and you needed to book in, in advance to get a time you wanted. They spoke you through the treatments and tailored it to your needs/what smells/oils may suit yourself.

We use the trip service in the hotel and struck up a relationship with one of the men who then took us on 3/4 trips through out our time. We picked where we wanted to go and he took us, also stopping at lovely little local restaraunts on the way. They were reasonably priced and cheaper than using taxis if your not brave enough to ride a motorbike!

We had a lovely time at the hotel, always clean and the staff could never do enough for you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
498,Hotel great but check in disaster,30,December 2018,"Firstly, hotel itself is fine! Lovely rooms and pools are awesome- we had a nice stay overall.
The only problem is that upon check in, I was asked for my Visa card. I have two and the staff said I needed the exact one from Booking.com.
This was a problem because I booked the hotel eight months ago and in the meantime have had a new cards sent to me (totally normal as they expire and are lost etc). The hotel had taken my full booking fee instantly so I had already paid and had a receipt Etc emailed throughout the year.
When I could not produce my old bank card nothing transpired and I was repeatedly told I needed the card.
I don’t understand this policy at all?
I had paid, it’s all under my name, I produced a passport and two other Visa cards.
The staff took a long time to finally just let me check in ans I was really upset by then. They weren’t that helpful at all.
So please don’t get caught out like I did. Maybe the hotel needs to re design that policy? No other hotel in my time over in Bali asked for the exact card and I stayed at 3 other resorts - no problems!
I did experience great help and service from all other staff and security though as the trip progressed.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
499,Nice experience staying at the haven,50,December 2018,"I stayed at suite. It was such a nice room that i've got. I hate to leave but i have to go back to work :( The location is peaceful and i love the green situation at the restaurant when i had breakfast. All the front desk staffs are very welcoming and friendly. Especially Febby, she is very informative, friendly and respectful. She tried her best to give any information that i needed. The shutle that took me to the beach, i loved it as well. It helps when you don't want to walk to the beach in a hot sunny day. Thank you for lovely stay. I would certainly come back and keep in touch with Febby.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
500,Short and sweet stay,50,December 2018,"Originally booked the the hotel room but after one night we decided to look round the grounds and found there were suites at the rear of the property. We were lucky to meet Febby who allowed us to look at one of the suites which we decided to upgrade immediately as we had a three more days in Seminyak. Febby was really helpful and gracious. The room was ready in no time and we felt very welcomed.
All the staff are polite and happy and greet us with genuine warmth.
My only issue was that we had to leave after three days. The driver we had on our return transfer was very friendly and safe. I can’t remember his name though. I think it starts with a D and four letters.
Thank you for a lovely stay",The Haven Bali Seminyak
501,Very welcoming,40,December 2018,"My friend and i were looked after like king and queens!

Miss Febby made our stay so so special. My friend and i were celebrating 30 years of our friendship and Miss Febby surprised us with a beautiful cake!

We were upgraded from hotel to suite, which was just fantastic Miss Febby organised everything and was so respectful and helpful we enjoyed our stay so much!
They have a great Spa section, Was close to everything that we needed!

We would definitely come back and make contact with Miss Febby!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
502,"Good, not so good, excellent",40,November 2018,"Walked past this place numerous times over the years and always thought it too busy, too many loud Aussies and all together not for me, a single mature male. This time because of personal circumstances and its position, I decided to try. Airport pickup perfect--you pay more but my No.1 rule in travelling is airport pickup. Hotel checkin very professional and as room not ready was quite happy to go to Bintang to get supplies and a sim card--believe that is changing re mobiles. There are 2 parts to this hotel, let's call it economy and business class. The economy is the front section and seems to attract the party crowd and the long walk to business are the suites and villas. The gardens are more beautiful as well as the 3 pools and an in and out door breakfast restaurant. My suite overlooked the pool-first floor--there are 4 with lifts. Unfortunately a leak in my air con caused very minor damage to my property and the move to another suite was handled very promptly and efficiently-the staff, who ever trains them should be congratulated-because everyone were extremely courteous and friendly. The hand on heart is their form of greeting and I found myself repeating this loving acknowledgement. The suits are huge, dated but very comfortable and the day beds on the patio very welcome. As reported, the bath/shower is a nightmare[loved the subtle lighting]. If elderly, large and unsteady, DO NOT get a suite with a shower over the bath--I hope the hotel has adequate insurance.
The buffet breakfast suited me as I am not a cooked breakfast person--lots of fruit etc but heap of other things from almost every country available, and proper coffee included--that was a big bonus.
A shuttle will take you to Seminyak beach to a private lounge area without the bother of hawkers.
I would stay there again for the staff service,position, food but definitely enquire about a shower.
I believe the hotel changed hands about 9 years ago and they are reluctant to spend. This is unfortunate as the outside[gardens/pool] looks good[don't be put off as I was by the first impression of crowded drop off and busy open cocktail lounge] but the dated suites interior needs a very strong broom and lots of $s to satisfy today's modern traveller.
I rate between 3 and 4 stars",The Haven Bali Seminyak
503,Needs a Renovation,20,November 2018,I stayed here for one night because the house I was suppose to stay at was not available when I arrived. The photos online of this hotel make it look much more cleaner than it is. I booked a one bedroom suite and all the wear and tear shows. It also did not have central A/C. They need to renovate this hotel and replace all the finishes asap. It's on a really noisy street in the heart of Seminyak if you're into that? I won't be returning to stay here.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
504,"Good Location, Big Suite, Terrible bathroom",30,December 2018,"We stayed in the Haven 1 bedroom suites for 6 days, the room is very spacious and light filled, however what lets the suite down is its bathroom as it is dark with dangerous bathtub. Also we wanted to do a later checkout as our flight had got delayed and wanted to extend it by 3 hours and were quoted 800k IDR for 3 hour stay which is about $ 80.00 !!!

Cons

• The bathroom only had dim lights
• The Bathtub is very dangerous as you have a take a high step to get into the bath as the shower is over the bath. Once you finish the shower the holding rail gets wet and slippery making it dangerous to get out of the bath. Perhaps they could just remove the bath and just have a shower will be much better
• The hot water tap is running with Boiling hot water which also caused burns to my hand, so please be careful when you turn the hot water tap
• Morning buffet is although very nice, they should have put the fruits in a net lid as there are too many flies around the buffet.
• The restaurants do not have fans and it gets very hot and humid in Bali

Pros

• Awesome staff, always eager to help
• Very good location, Bintang supermarket 5 mins walk
• Quite rooms as suites are located at the back of the hotel

If you are travelling with Elderly or children please be careful whilst utilizing the bathroom or ask for a suite with a shower only.
Overall a OK experience, We won’t be returning as if you are paying over $160.00 per night like we did, as we have seen and experienced better hotels in Seminyak and legian with better rooms, amenities and service in this price range.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
505,Bad Reservations,10,December 2018,"I made a reservation directly thru their website. In Their website, they have this called ""Best Rate Guarantee"" but unfortunately they didn't fulfill their promise. I submitted the claim thru their website as per instruction in their website. You know what...? They said they did not receive any claim, instead they received event reservation request. While i receive auto-reply email with subject Best Rate Guarantee.

I was so sad to hear what the staff replied me, They ask me to submit a new claim, when They already close the room type that i booked before. The saddest thing is, when the Tourism Ministry trying their best to increase tourist visitor to Bali, there are still some people not doing their part.

If you would like to book a room in this hotel, I suggest you not to book directly from their website.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
506,We will be back,40,November 2018,"Loved our stay. Room was good, always clean. Breakfast was good, just not always hot. We will come back here as central to stuff. Meals are well priced for dinner. Plenty of stuff to do near buy, and bintang supermarket close buy",The Haven Bali Seminyak
507,Great rooms,40,November 2018,"We had the interconnecting family room apartment it was so spacious and clean the breakfast was amazing we seemed to hang out in the back quiet part of the hotel and pool and found it to be a great first part of our holiday the pool service was amazing and the concierge service to be fast and helpful most of the staff were gracious and considerate I do recommend the spa massages they were worth the money.
I won’t be going back to this hotel though I did get a belt stolen from my room I contacted the hotel about this and havn’t had any feedback at all.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
508,Literal heaven!,50,September 2018,"The Haven was heaven for us on our holiday. Definitely recommend a suite style room! Amazing balcony and day bed, luxurious bathroom and huge bed we absolutely loved it.

The pools and grounds are very tidy, beautiful and relaxing. It was a great escape from the hustle and bustle out on the streets to come back and relax here on our balcony or by the pool.

Staff very friendly and helpful! Wifi worked well.

Good location - walking distance to double six beach. Seminyak square is walkable but about 30min walk.

Breakfast was awesome too! Great coffee and so many food options. 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",The Haven Bali Seminyak
509,"Great spot, beautiful people☺️",40,November 2018,"We recently stayed in a 2 bedroom villa to celebrate my husbands 30th.
The resort, though a little older then some was very nice and in a great spot for us.
Nice and close to shopping spots and only a short cab ride to anywhere else.

There were pros and cons to the room:

Pros:
Great pools outside both bedrooms(yes- 2 pools)
Nice and private
Big room and bathrooms
Great buffet breakfast every morning

Con:
Major issues with our air con in the main bedroom so it was never cool enough(they were constantly doing repairs but still wasn’t right for the whole 10 days we were there)
Only very small bar fridges in both rooms and a small kitchen outside downstairs. I think they could re-do the room to make space for a kitchenette inside at least the main bedroom.(we had a 9 month old baby with us so wasn’t much room in the fridge)

All in all we were well looked after and were very happy with the resort and staff. With a few upgrades, it could be great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
510,Wonderful Stay,50,May 2018,"We stayed at the Haven Suite, which is a huge (96 m2) room, with a large living room and beautiful balcony with a double-day bed - perfect! It was lovely and spacious. The living area included a kitchen, dining table, lounge and TV.

The location was also quite good. Not very center of Seminyak, but 25-30 minute walking distance to the main party area.10-minute walk to the Double Six Beach.
The pool area was very quiet, green and beautiful, but too shaded. There was almost no sun during the day. But it's had not been a problem for us, as we are mostly beach lovers.
There was a great selection of dishes for the breakfast, even sushi. It would satisfy taste of all kinds of cuisine lovers.
Staff was also really amazing, being always ready to help you for 24 hours. Especially the trainee, called Mikey.
I would definitely recommend the hotel to everyone. It made our stay at Bali much more charming and beautiful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
511,Excellent for families!,50,October 2018,"We booked a double room, travelling with two children, and were really impressed with the size and quality of the rooms. Clean and comfortable, we had a great view of the pool from level one. Breakfast is great. Location is also good, with a nice back entrance to the hotel, which leads down to Double Six. Highly recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
512,Never again,10,November 2018,2nd time I visited here. My first experience was great in a one bedroom suite. This time I decided to book a Haven room with a reqest for the front building room. Upon arrival they advised I will be upgraded to a Delux room. I was placed in the second building on the 2nd floor. What a disaster.. You pay for a clean hotel but get terrible service. I had to ask twice for a phone adaptor but staff at reception still never brought one to me. They only made up my room when l spoke to someone in the corridor as they foget and the following day they did not empty my rubbish bins. I checked out one day earlier and will never stay here again. There was even mould on the seat on the balcony. The only thing good about my stay here was the breakfast and the grounds are looking good. Be careful what room you are looking for if you stay here. If that was a delux room l would hate to think what The Haven room was going to be like.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
513,"Been here a lot, sooo satisfied",50,November 2018,"Been here quite a often, today was my 6th visit, and second this Nov'18. Staffs were so friendly, Mrs. Febby was the FO assisting my check in. Room quite big, well its a suite anyway, though the hotel unit also quite spacious, have not tried the villa til now yet, perhaps on a free upgrade Hahaha. Complete ammenities. Nice location. Nice layout for Sabine Resto, and quiet and relaxing breakfast at Lemon Cello. Breakfast was always great. Bed was always comfy. Highly satisfied, thus why i frequently stayed here. Keep up the good work!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
514,Pass mark,40,November 2018,"Beautiful resort with very friendly staff who always stop to say hello. Upon arrival we were taken to our room and bags all taken care of for us. Our air conditioning wasn’t working however a quick stop in at the front desk resolved the issue and we came back to a nice cool room post dinner. Bathrooms are tidy and quite a cool lay out. Bed was huge and comfy, would definitely recommend this place if you’re in Bali",The Haven Bali Seminyak
515,A “tired” hotel,30,October 2018,"Stayed three nights at this strategically-located hotel. Upon checking in, we found the front office lady quite ill-informed about the specifics of the two-bedroom suite we had booked. She could not immediately confirm whether there would be one or two bathrooms, incorrectly stating only one bathroom was available for the two bedrooms which prompted us to request a change to two rooms instead of the suite. After much confusion and her calling around (on a walkie talkie), she eventually informed us that the two bedroom suite indeed had two bathrooms. It was not a good start.

The suite was spacious and had a kitchenette. The bedrooms and bathrooms were of a good size. However, the whole unit, while clean enough, was old, dark and not well maintained. Within the first two hours of entering the unit, we called on maintenance a number of times as we discovered telephones not working, insufficient lighting, loose wiring, airconditioning not cold enough and so on. On the upside, the maintenance staff was quick to come to our suite and were able to resolve all issues.

The bathroom was problematic to the point of dangerous for us. Unless one is young and with long legs, it was very difficult to get in and out of the bathtub/shower unit. One could easily slip (almost did) and with not much to hold on to in such an event, it was tough to manuever in and out. Thankfully, we were able to request for tub mats but it was still a challenging experience during every shower time.

I must comment that the hallways are not air-conditioned and while this is not an issue at all, the dank musty smell is unpleasant. Poor ventilation and close proximity to the building next door exuded odors one would rather not inhale.

On the positive side, breakfasts were nice enough, the selection was sufficient and the bacon was wonderful. Staff were all nice and helpful. Wifi is complimentary.

This hotel is suitable for a younger less finicky clientele. I would not go back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
516,Out Standing Value,50,November 2018,"A fabulous hotel that not only offers hotels rooms, most important the hotel Has 1 & 2 bedroom suites and stand alone villas
Important this hotel also has its own private beach area right in the middle of double six beach",The Haven Bali Seminyak
517,The Haven is exactly that,50,October 2018,Extremely busy hotel but the nicest and most accommodating staff especially those on the front desk. Looked after me like I was royalty. Second time here. Had a great room overlooking the pool with a terrific balcony. I was at the end of a corridor and all the rooms next to me were undergoing renovation but just painting and some plastering so no noise. Had a wonderful deep tissue massage. The spa area just beautiful and tranquil. It’s set amongst the villas so very quiet and beautiful layout and treatment rooms. The room was compact but plenty of space and the layout worked well. Bed was comfy. Breakfast was fantastic and lovely hostess in the dining room. Good coffee but you need to pay extra - only $1.50 aud though. Good location on busy street. 5 minute walk to the beach. Easy enough to walk back from eat street but probably good half hour. Bintang supermarket just down the road. My minibar was entirely empty no milk or anything but easy enough to stock up at Bintang. I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again. Might try a villa next time 🧡,The Haven Bali Seminyak
518,Poor experience trying to stay positive,20,November 2018,"On checkin took 30 minutes with one staff member
Rooms outdated beds so uncomfortable I was battling to walk one morning creaked every time you moved
Meals ordinary on an occasion we invited friends and we all were unable to eat dinner
Lots of staff but don’t seem to know or understand their job heaps of trainees
Drinks slow making and again bar staff don’t understand requests you seem to repeat yourself over and over
On a positive note good pool,good location close to restaurants and shops and a shuttle to nearby Seminyak beach
Definitely won’t be coming back to many negatives management should have a close look at the staff they seem to be lost",The Haven Bali Seminyak
519,Quality Stay and Staff!,50,October 2018,"The hotel staff were amazing, so happy to help and breakfast staff recognised us only after a couple of days and were so friendly, stopping always to chat! Close to some good food places and the pools were always clean and towels supplied! Would definitely make a trip back to The Haven!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
520,A Hotel in 2 halves.,30,October 2018,"My wife and I recently spent a week at The Haven. The hotel has a standard room section and also another section for villas and suites. we stayed in a suite. The suite was very roomy with all the standard facilities however the decor was looking a bit 'tired' however in the Hotels defense they are starting refurbishment of their rooms. WiFi reception was excellent and the room had a safe. Breakfast was taken in the restaurant around the pool and was of good quality with a wide choice. Service in this part of the Hotel was exceptional with the staff being very courteous and friendly. The pool area was great and with Mojitos at Au$10 for two (happy hour all day) a great place to relax. A shuttle bus is available to take you to The Haven's beach retreat on 66 beach and runs from 9am to 5pm daily.
The story in the front part of the Hotel is somewhat different in that you could almost believe you were in a different Hotel. The service at Sabeen is deplorable, the food very ordinary and the staff almost untrained in customer service. On one occasion my wife and I ordered a meal from the menu however we were served plates of food from the buffet which we had not ordered. When I asked where our order was we were told it would not be long being served. 20 minutes later the food had not arrived and we were unable to even order another round of drinks despite there being 5 people behind the bar talking amongst themselves. 10 minutes later we paid for the one round of drinks we'd had and left complaining to the Duty manager at reception. All in all a very poorly run section of the Hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
521,Disappointed from the start and not a 4 star refined hotel,20,November 2018,"From the start we had issues. On checking in our request for a lower level room was accommodated with twin beds when a large double was booked. This seems to be a common issue. We had 4 different rooms over 3 nights, with one move at 12 am to get away from the street and traffic noise as the door of the room would not close fully. We were put into a suite for the remainder of the night which was nice but still quite average for their price. Finally into our room for the next 11 nights, and very ordinary and not on a lower level as requested as I have a bad knee and find stairs a strain. Lumpy pillows, mouldy curtains, a musty smell from damp, towels were gruby and an occassional sewer smell in the bathroom.
Food is average, we had to ask for bacon on 2 mornings as it was removed to accommodate a small group of Muslims who would not have touched it anyway.
Bacon and sausages were cold most of the time. Pool area is unsafe with decking very loose and a hazard. Sun couches are old, musty and stained. The room safe jammed with our valuables inside and again the balcony door did not close fully but was repaired.
On a positive, our experience with the staff was good. Very attentive and polite. Shame they don't pay their trainees (at all) so tip them whenever possible. Atma Spa is the best thing this place had going for it. We won't be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
522,Perfect Location Awesome Resort!,50,October 2018,"We are Bali regulars but when our usual accommodation choice was fully booked we decided to try here and were very happy we did. The resort while being a very large resort caters to those just wanting a hotel room to gorgeous villas to large suites which was our choice. The suite was very large with full size kitchen dining and lounge. Balcony was huge with big day bed. We were able to view the villas and they are some of the most amazing ones i have seen so private you dont feel like you are in such a big resort. Option of 1 and 2 bedroom villas We were so impressed with the resort from the beautiful gardens to the restaurants to the amazing day spa.
Breakfast is buffet style, with the suites and villas using the back restaurant Lemon Cello and the hotel rooms using the front restaurant. Plenty of food choices available
Location wise, fantastic right in the middle of it all. Bintang Supermarket is not too far to stock up on a few supplies, the beach about a 10 min walk and there is shopping a plenty!
I think the nicest part of the stay was the staff. A very special thank you to the very lovely Ernita for looking after us so well during our whole stay and my surprise Birthday cake, and to Riyani at Lemon Cello, what an awesome hostess so happy and friendly!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
523,An Aptly Named Haven in Slightly Chaotic Seminyak,50,September 2018,"Retreating from the chaotic streets of Seminyak into the calm of the Haven Hotel and Suites is both welcome, a pleasure and a sanctuary. You will be glad of your hotel choice and the opportunity to sit back away from the busy streets where there is some solitude and peace and a haven.

Planning a holiday and finding a superb hotel is not the easiest challenge in any new destination. We had holidayed in Seminayak / Legian on several previous visits to Bali. On the last occasion were fortunate to have the Haven recommended by a fellow traveller. She sang its praises not because of any perceived superior quality rating or particular facilities but because of the location, value for money and the service provided. What a fortuitous find. We realised they thrive on returning guests – no wonder.

The recommendation proved to be valuable both for prior booking and during our five day stay. I found the level of e-mail communication for a direct booking extraordinarily good and a credit to the reservation department. I have previously reviewed this aspect of making an inquiry on Trip Advisor and for then a booking at the Haven. They met all our room requests (king bed with topper, pool view, upper floor, balcony, walk-in shower) and they delivered on our expectations, so what more could you ask for.

The Haven has many attributes indeed.

Perhaps the main one is this is a bargain accommodation option providing very good service at a modest price with attention to the details more normal in a higher rated hotel. A gem in the heart of Seminyak: large enough to maximise provision and with all room and facility options and commendable dining. So very well done Haven.

The location of the Haven on Jalan Raya Seminyak [JRS] adjacent to Jalan Arjuna [Double Six Street] is ideal for everything in Seminyak and Legian. The hotel consequently has two entrance / exit points that you will see is an access asset. The street view from the front of the (Sabeen) restaurant is entertaining. There is easy access to the Bintang supermarket ( 5 minutes) that you will use repeatedly and then close to the famous Grain restaurant, to Warung Made and the main Jalan Abamanya thoroughfare further into Seminyak and to Eat Street with their multiple dining options. And there is an easy walk and shops on Double Six Street and the restaurants on JRS. You would return here for the location alone I believe.

For accommodation we booked a junior suite. It was absolutely ideal and sizeable (60+ sq m). Well appointed and equipped. It is on the top (fourth) floor [room 4020] in the main hotel building, well laid-out with a large lounge / dining area with a dining table (needed and useful for your suitcases and storage), a sizeable bedroom, spacious bathroom with walk-in shower and a large bath and electric plug point, and a very useable furnished discrete balcony area overlooking the main pool. We were very pleased with this room arrangement and the quality air conditioning. Worth inquiring for as I believe they only have a small number of this junior suite option and it is well priced. It should be made clear that this (junior) suite option is not part of the more expensive separate suites / villas that are in the adjacent part of the hotel complex towards the alleyway leading out to Double Six Street. Confusing I know but these are the other advertised suites in their own defined area. The junior suite had a huge comfortable bed, two flat screen TVs, a good fridge (with no mini-bar items) so you can purchase from the supermarket, and a wardrobe with robes and slippers, and a safe.

The pool area is very usable with plenty of loungers but they do come under demand - but there is the second pool area in the suite complex beyond that is underutilised but very pleasant. Despite some review comments on sun it does get sun (check it out) and the shade offered is at time a welcome relief.

The beach shuttle service to the Haven’s beach club works well. It runs two hourly from 9am – 5pm to and from the Double Six Street entrance. We used it several times and there are plenty of sun-loungers, towels provided, and it is supervised for hotel guests’ exclusive use. However, avoid the adjacent toilets at all costs. The beach club allows you to explore the beachfront area, the warung eateries, learn to surf, people watch and it is an easy walk back to the hotel. In fact the vagaries of the one way roading system and traffic chaos means walking back is actually quicker than using the shuttle… 10 minutes, it is close.

The hotel’s staff is courteous and obliging and housekeeping was discrete and covered all of our needs. They work with many nationalities and need to be admired for their patience and resourcefulness. A quiet “suksama” (thank you in Balinese dialect) to any staff member goes a long way to help. We were provided with a complementary airport pick-up at 10 pm arrival so the holiday started effortlessly and check-in was a breeze.

The accommodation was cost-effective indeed, and if breakfast is not included it is a bargain as evidenced by many people coming in for breakfast from other hotels. The dining room was slightly chaotic at times but there is a great variety, it was replenished and the breakfast choices did vary from day to day. They serve bacon (not always so in Bali), have local Indonesian hot food options (with fish / meat curries etc), other Asian dishes, all the usual egg / pancake options and the full range of European / continental breakfast items. An impressive morning buffet for the price charged in a large functional restaurant. At the main on-site Sabeen Restaurant they have themed evening buffets that at a cost of 135,000 IDR ++ (162,000 IDR) [$16 NZ] per head (eg the Friday seafood buffet) for an extensive selection meant the hotel dining was also cost effective.

The Haven seemed to have very satisfied guests. Occasionally, at times it did include the usual parties of overly loud poolside guests from the large continental island to the south of Bali, but this is Bali.

So what are the areas to improve? There are only a few. The hotel does not try to be other than 4 stars so it admirably delivers for its rating and price. The lighting in the rooms is problematic particularly for applying make-up and reading. There is a lack of drawers and shelving if you are a guest who chooses to unpack, however, having the lounge did help with this. Otherwise if the attributes of the Haven that we found, compared with other Seminyak 4 star hotels, seem to fit your needs then you will have a cost effective and pleasing stay in a great location with an efficient hotel operation. Even when the hotel is well occupied, because it is not small, you will not feel pressures or the need to waste any time queuing or unduly waiting for service. The Haven in Seminyak is indeed aptly named… a peaceful haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
524,Enjoyable stay & amazing staff,40,October 2018,"Me and my partner stayed at the Haven for 3 nights. We was allocated a room at the front of the hotel and it was opposite the main road so it was very noisy, I asked to change rooms and they allocated us a quieter room the next day at the back of the hotel which was perfect. The staff at the hotel are amazing! It was my partners birthday & they delivered a cake to our room. Location is good, walking distance to the beach. The buffet breakfast is good, so much choice. The hotel overall is very good value for money!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
525,Really is the haven of Seminyak!,50,November 2018,Me and my girlfriend stayed here in a suite for 2 weeks and everything was amazing! Staff extremely friendly especially my good mate Sugi who went above and beyond to look after us! He really made the trip special with endless buffet breakfasts and dinners. I loved it here and would highly recommend it :),The Haven Bali Seminyak
526,BALI HAVEN,40,October 2018,"I would recommend the Bali Haven for a stay in Seminyak.
Clean, tidy and close to all tourist areas.
Rooms are clean but in need of a renovation.
The breakfast offered as a package is good.
But a thank you to the staff who were always attentive always smiling and happy
Highly recommended.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
527,Don't bother,20,August 2018,"I had four nights here, two at the beginning and end of an organised tour that took us to other parts of the island. Twice they couldn't find my booking & I had to show them my booking receipt email. I had to check out and and check back in each time even on consecutive nights. The rooms were dirty and bathrooms mouldy. The covers on the pool lounges were stained and full of burn marks. Baggage was left out in the open where anyone could access it, not stored securely, the food in the restaurant was terrible, the breakfast buffet had lots of variety but not v good quality. Some of the staff were pleasant but they were the exception.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
528,Much better,50,October 2018,"I had stayed at the Haven a couple of years ago when I was allocated a room above the restaurant/bar and faced the street very noisy.
This time I had a room over the pool very quiet which was perfect
This is a great hotel if your just wanting to transit to other places in Bali
Great to watch time/place/people go by",The Haven Bali Seminyak
529,Awesome stay!,40,October 2018,"My friends and I checked in The Haven Bali Seminyak from 5 to 8 October. The check in process was smooth and the front desk staff, Febby was friendly and helpful. We loved our Villa so very much - spacious, clean, quiet, leafy surrounding and the bed is comfy. Good location and easy to find the hotel with various shops nearby. We enjoyed our stay overall.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
530,Amazing,50,October 2018,"Friendly and Cooperative management , Wonderful Ambience with cleanliness in rooms ,
perfect location near to the market . variety in breakfast is provided , a place worth stayin in for a holiday in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
531,Great location,40,October 2018,"I stayed here twice in the past few weeks. Hotel grounds are really nice and the breakfast here is great. Valets are particularly helpful but every staff member I met was extremely friendly and a real asset to the hotel. We had an all you can eat buffet by the pool one day which was excellent value!

My room on my second visit seemed a little older and not as nice as the first one, but still a nice room. The key cards are a bit problematic and a few of my party had to go to reception to reactivate them. WiFi was very good. I’d definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
532,Nice hotel Nice location,40,October 2018,"I wanted a cheap hotel to stay over 2 nights in the busy streets of Seminyak.
This was perfect, the hotel is simple, basic and with great facilities.
The hotel is little dated and could do with renovations but it’s a nice place, little busy and not the most relaxing place but very friendly staff and does the job for few nights near 66 beach and bars.
I’ll recommend it but make sure you get good price as it isn’t an hotel you should pay expensive price to stay in.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
533,"Outdated room, friendly stuff",20,October 2018,"We were 2 couples staying at the Haven hotel and the hotel was disappointment. We booked 2 rooms for 4 people in this hotels because we saw great reviews. Later I realised those comments are mainly for the other 2 part of the Haven (suits and villas). When we arrived to the hotel, they did not have 2 rooms with king beds, but only with 2 single beds, okey we didnt care much to be honest. Then they took us to our room and we were in shock. The room was on the ground floor, when walking to your room you have a feeling like you are walking to the dungeon. As soon as we opened the room, there was a terrible humid/moldy air in the room (not to mention the mold on the walls). In both of our rooms. We asked for new rooms on the higher floors. We got 2 rooms on the 4th floor. Much better in terms of the smell/mold, but the room 4022/4021 definitely could have been better. You cannot sleep much as the room is facing the street and there is loud noise coming from the people on the street and the traffic (we bought earplugs). Our bathroom sink and bathtub was clogged so that the water did not go out. The stuff fixed the sink, but there is not much they can do as the entire room needs improvements.
The best part of the hotel is the super nice and friendly stuff, they will help you with everything. Pool is also nice. Rooms are spacious. However, the room itself is outdated, needing improvements on the wall,bathroom, isolation etc. Unfortunately, our overall impression was poor.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
534,Amazing stay,50,October 2018,"Couldn't have had a better 1st night in bali.

We arrived quite late after a 7hr delayed flight to find they had given us an upgrade to a beautiful suite!

The room was huge and extremely comfortable, the breakfast was great, staff super friendly and dont get me started on the Massages!

It was actually a real shame we only had 1 night!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
535,"Wonderful, as always!",50,September 2018,"Recently returned from yet another wonderful and relaxing stay at The Haven. The one bedroom suites are spacious, comfortable, quiet and provide a really enjoyable experience.
As always, the staff were friendly & accommodating and treated us like family returning for another visit home.
The location is superb with a range of locations (Double Six, Seminyak, Legian & Kuta) all within a manageable walking distance or short taxi ride. The service and quality of accommodation experience is always consistent at The Haven and we will look forward to our 6th visit again soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
536,Simply Superb,40,October 2018,"I have been staying at the Haven Hotel for many years and this years stay did not disappoint. We were greeted by Ayu at the front reception with the happiest smile. Our check in was smooth although our room wasnt ready we were supplied with a welcome drink whilst we waited. Our room was plentiful for 2 persons. Large kingsize bed, flat screen TV, kitchenette, full size fridge with a sitting area. I must say though, our air con did struggle the whole time we were there. We reported this a number of times but felt it made no difference to the temperature this did make sleeping at night uncomfortable. One other point to be noted is that some suite rooms have the shower i the bath and it is very awkward getting in and out and this will not suite the elderly. I would like to see the hotel remove the bathtubs as they are not needed.
Breakfast is always the best at the Haven. Everything is freshly cooked, egg station and pancake station. Breakfast can be taken at the rear of property for the Suites. Hotel supplies a shuttle transport to the beach club at 9am every morning. There is a staff member who over sees the sunlounges & towels on the beach. We had a 1 hour massage in the spa and i would HIGHLY recommend this very clean and professional service. I am yet to find another comparable hotel to the Haven. Highly recommend",The Haven Bali Seminyak
537,Pleasant stay,50,October 2018,"I stayed for 2 days in this hotel. It was really nice to stay in this hotel. The front desk staffs are friendly, informative & willing to help. All the staffs are very welcoming and especially Febby. Thank you for helping us during our stay. All the facilities in this hotel are nice. The green atmosphere is such a breathtaking situation that i love the most. The free shuttle to the beach is one of facilities that makes the guest easier to reach the beach club. Thank you for having us.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
538,Strategic hotel location,50,October 2018,Me and my husband enjoyed to stay in this hotel. The hotel is very classy and the atmosphere is just wonderful. The food was ok. As you exit the lobby many shops that i can buy many things for merchandise. Lots of restaurants sorrounding that make us easier to pick foods that we like. The price of the hotel is reasonable and the staffs are very welcome. Febby and Desi are the staffs i would like to mention. Thank you for helping us when we checked in and also during our stay. It was lovely. We will certainly come back next time.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
539,restaurant review,50,October 2018,"Passed this place this afternoon and saw that they were doing a BBQ buffet dinner evening with entertainment for 135,000 IDR apprx £7
So thought we would give it a go.

The evenings entertainment was a pirate of the Caribbean evening with Balinese dancers and fire dancers and a cocktail show.
The dancers were pretty cool and added to ambience of the evening.
Even managed to get a free cocktail from the show, which is always a bonus.

The food was pretty good. They had Satay skewers with prawns and Squid. Various meat dishes, sausages, Ribs, corn, pasta's, potatoes, salads etc as well as deserts.

They had an offer on cocktails 2 for 1 so 2 Majito's came in at 99,000 IDR which is pretty good considering the location and the venue itself.

All up a pretty good nights entertainment, for 2 people with 2 cocktails came to 450,000 IDR £22 which included a tip.

would reccomend this place and go again, if I have the time",The Haven Bali Seminyak
540,Our 4th time back and we still love it.,40,October 2018,"Can’t fault The Haven. It’s our favourite place to stay when in Bali. The suites are so nice and spacious and the hotel is located in a great location.
Buffet breakfast is fantastic 10/10.
All of the staff we encountered were lovely and friendly in particular Riyani. She offers amazing service at breakfast ( 10/10) and is always so welcoming and friendly. She should be commended!
Thanks for another great stay The Haven, we will return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
541,Love the location!,40,October 2018,"First of all, it is the best hotel for people watching... the lounge is facing Seminyak road. You can watch people walking by, traffic jam, etc.

The hotel consist of 3 types of accommodation:- hotel, suites and villa. The hotel room is adequate and the best rooms are facing the pool.

For me, the best part of this place is the location... near double six road where you can go to the beach, a lot of shopping and massage nearby, and bintang supermarket is also not that far. And if there's a traffic jam I can always use Nakula street to avoid the jam.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
542,Absolutely Heaven in Seminyak,50,September 2018,"""What should I say?""...All is perfect at place !! Thanks a lot to the reservation team which made my 5 days experience fantastic..Thank you for secured my booking based on request. The booking process was easy and quick. Check in procedure was also very easy and also they provide welcome drink and cold towel when we arrive.
Front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly...they arranged my tour activities with friendly tour driver. The buffet breakfast is really nice and a lot of choices...
They have beautiful Beach club, completely with free shuttle service.
Special thanks to the Receptionist who provided us the transport to the airport. Definitely will return back again next year..!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
543,Unique and pleasant hotel,50,September 2018,"Thank you for having me as your guest! It was great for me to stay in this hotel, i realised that your hotel was fairly big and i loved the trees surrounding the hotel. I think your hotel is unique with the design of 3 different buildings in a wide area. The front desk was very informative and friendly. They were willing to help. The beach club and its shuttle bus, and the facilities was what i loved the most. Nice atmosphere was always created by this hotel. Your hotel is very strategic that i can find many shops and restaurant as you exit the hotel. Great stay all in all",The Haven Bali Seminyak
544,Excellent,50,October 2018,"Excellent place and service. Always come back here for trip in bali and staff at front office (gede and febby) is very helpful with our needs and information about transport,activities, and local food guide.Food is great and the price is reasonable",The Haven Bali Seminyak
545,"Amazing room and hotel, good location. In house taxi drivers will rip you off",40,September 2018,"Pros
- Great price
- Room 4020 on the top floor was brilliant and very large
- The hotel itself is very clean and staff are very friendly
- Room service Spag Bol was amazing
- The pool

Cons
- Breakfast is buffet style and not a huge amount of choice
- The taxi drivers based inside the hotel will quote you nearly double the amount you should pay, ignore them and walk straight onto the street and you'll pick up a Blue Bird taxi straight away for alot cheaper.
- Had a slight issue with our credit card while checking in and they presented us a spreadsheet with our booking on.. along with about 12 other guests names and FULL credit card details. I don't think data protection has hit Bali yet.
- Location feels at the very bottom of the strip.

Recommendations
- Request room 4020 if possible. Its on the top floor and we think is the biggest in the hotel
- Order room service it was really nice!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
546,Great location and pretty good value,40,October 2018,"We booked two rooms and got two quite sizeable rooms with really clean interiors and great facilities on the site - also had breakfast included in our booking. Rooms included good wifi, very ordinary TV (but that's not a big issue these days), working fridge, great bathroom.

The Hotel features two restaurants which both served quite cheap but high quality meals. Getting a decent meal at a Hotel for under $10 is quite a novelty compared to other countries. Breakfast was good with a mix of western/Asian/Balinese dishes on offer.

Three pools that we could count plus a babies pool/ My two daughters tried out their day spa having the 3 hr treatment for around $AUD65. Both girls were really happy with the experience.

Location is good being in the middle of pretty much everything. We were good walkers so could walk either to Kuta shops or Seminyak Village - neither of which were all that awesome. Beach was a few minutes walk.

Probably should avoid the rooms right at the front of the resort as the main road is busy and loud.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
547,Terrible management and staff,10,October 2018,"Terrible management. When I arrived the hotel had the wrong booking and they mentioned they could do nothing about it. Was kept waiting at the reception for over 30 minutes as the reception confirmed the booking situation with their e-commerce team. after the long wait, no solution. Speaking to the manager on duty provided no results and they offered no solution. Finally settled for a room after 1 hour.
the next day requested an item from house keeping and was kept waiting for over 2 hours. Called the reception 2-3 times and finally after making a strong claim they sent the request to the room after 5 minutes.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
548,Loved it!,50,October 2018,"This hotel is just beautiful. Situated only a 10 minute walk from double six beach and close to alot of good restaurants.

The room was generous in size and had a cute balcony.

The buffet breakfast had alot of choice and everything tatsed really good.

I would highly recommend staying here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

550,Pool villas are tired,30,December 2017,"Stayed for a week over Xmas for my fiftieth . Having stayed in October the year before in one of the normal
Rooms I thought the pool villa would be such a treat .Visually at first glance it looks lovely until you see the walls crumbling and bubbling paint from water damage . The pool lights don’t work the deck around pool
Has weird fungus growing thru it and the rocks falling off the feature wall behind pool into the pool was disgusting.
The button was broken on the toilet and we asked could it be fixed three days in a row and it was not and they had a piece of dirty string attached to the inside that was wet to touch .
We had spoken about a late check out and were happy to pay but were told this would be no problem until the last day we were told “no late check out room booked out “ they offered the use of a room to change and shower in . The room wasn’t a room it was a shower with enough room for my wet pack and then u step out of shower into hallway and can get dressed in a wardrobe. Definitely not a room as advised, we felt like we had booked a one star vacation .
The buffet breakfast is sensational as is the main pool res however I would not recommend the run down tired pool villas . Save your money and stay in the entry level base rooms as they are not run down at all.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
551,The Haven - Seminyak,40,September 2018,"Booked a 4star, 9 night stay as a get-away from the cold to balmy Bali. Late evening arrival at hotel and check-in extremely efficient. Shown to our ""Haven"" room - lights very dim, room clean - but hubby disappointed with rating: tiles on floor cracked, slightly dated décor but crisp clean linen on the queen bed in our ground floor room. Our shower leaked through to the room entrance = dangerous. Enquiries at reception the next morning led us to paying $50 per night extra for a one-bedroom suite. Yay, we were rapt at the huge difference. Front part of hotel is nearly 20 years old and the rear part (where suites and villas are (including the delightful Spa) only 9 years old.

The layout of the hotel is fantastic - busy street - breakfast/restaurant area, reception, and Haven rooms and first beautiful pool area. The gardens are beautifully maintained with massive palms, orchids, frangapani and bamboo planting.

The rear building comprises suites and villas which are so roomy and for us, a better layout. The bathrooms have massive baths with shower over, plenty of room for storage in the vanities and daily replenishment of shampoo, conditioner, body gel and bath foam. The wee kitchen suites have fill size refrigerator, coffee/tea facilities and some crockery. You need to ask for a frypan, pot, cooking utensils and tea towels. The rooms in the suite are lovely - so spacious. All rooms have a safe.

The hotel contains two restaurants- Sateen to the front, and lemon Cello (for the suites), Al Fresco dining and themed dinner nights (of which we attended the Pirates of the Caribbean night buffet for equiv. Of $13.50A per person), fire dancing and Balinese dancing, There is a tour desk to help out with day trips/taxis etc and plenty of In-House TV channels to all rooms. Gym facilities, yoga and stretching classes are on-site too).

Breakfast daily was included in our package and it didn't disappoint. We make a habit of ordering pots of tea with sliced root ginger every morning - to avoid ""Bali belly"". There is everything you could want for breakfast. Juices, smoothies (extra cost), pastry station, egg station, exotic fruit selection, Asian food, the usual bacon/sausages/noodles and there's even a delightful staff member making fresh pancakes and French toast.

The hotel provides a shuttle to the beach, free of charge and it leaves 2hrly from 9.00am to the ""Beach Spot"" staffed by the hotel where loungers and towels are provided. At the end of your visit, you're given a wee cold towel to refresh yourself with, before either walking 10 mins back to hotel, or taking the return shuttle.

The staff here are terrific. Everyone greets you with a smile and will go the extra mile for you. I always leave French chocolates for our room people - or alternate to leave some local currency, which they love.

Everything is available close to The Haven. Taxis, bike taxis (which I took to Carrefour), Circle K is across the road and next door and the famous Hinting Supermarket is about 100m down the road. n There is also a ""safe"" moneychanger in Circle K there.

I would come back again - to a suite - or villa. Thanks for being our safe ""Haven"". Our stay was well needed and so very well enjoyed.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
552,Loved it!,50,September 2018,"The Haven Seminyak is located about a 10 minute walk to the beach and probably about a 2 minute walk to Bintang supermarket (opposite direction) for groceries/supplies.

We had a one bed suite, pool view, which was huge and had a fab day bed on one balcony and table and chairs on the other. It was a great place/space to chill at the end of the day. Also very relaxing to sunbathe/read/snooze around the pools.

We tried our hand at yoga in the spa (only $5), but didn't checkout the gym. Used the shuttle bus to go to the beach club which is more a private beach than club but great because the beach towels, sun beds and unbrellas were there ready and we didn't get hassled by hawkers.

The (included) breakast was plentiful,fresh and a lot of choice. Also very handy to have the restaurant and bar for the nights we didn't want to go out for dinner - good food and good menu. There were days where entertainment was put in the evening but I can't review that as we didn't attend.

The airport transfer on arrival was really handy and I was very grateful for the bottle of cold water and cold wash cloth the driver handed me.

Wifi had a strong reliable signal throughout the hotel. Staff were always very polite with a ready smile - we had problems with an ATM card at one stage and the front desk staff were extremely helpful and also assisted with phone calls to the bank.

Overall we had a great stay, it certainly ticked all the boxes. Highly recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
553,Superb Staff in a Great Location,50,September 2018,"Our 9 days at The Haven were excellent. We had wanted to book a suite with twin beds but they didn't have one available for the entire duration so our first two nights were in a regular Haven room. I would definitely recommend spending the extra money for a suite as it's about 3 times larger than the regular rooms, for about another 50% on the room rate. The inclusive buffet breakfast was excellent. Lots of choice of hot, cold and items cooked to order, with both Asian and Western dishes. The two restaurants/bars are very pleasant with both indoor and outdoor seating. The spa is great and offers many different treatments as well as yoga classes at very reasonable prices. The hotel has two swimming pools, a gym and a small internet lounge with computers provided, as well as free and reliable WiFi in the guestrooms.

Our suite was spacious, clean and comfortable with loads of storage space and a huge balcony overlooking the pool. The hotel is centrally located with shops and restaurants all around and it's about a 15 minute walk to the beach - provided you're not distracted by all the shops! But the hotel does provide a free shuttle to/from their Beach Club which is just a 5 minute drive. It's a private roped off area on Double Six Beach exclusively for The Haven with sun loungers and umbrellas.

But the thing that really makes this hotel stand out is the staff, all of whom are excellent. Without exception, every staff member who walked past us always smiled and said hello. The Front Office staff in particular were extremely helpful with everything from making the booking to check out and nothing was too much trouble - we didn't need to do a thing when changing rooms as they moved all our stuff for us as soon as the suite was available.

All in all this is a great hotel in a great location. Highly recommended and I would definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
554,"Staff were Great, suites ideal, pool areas fabulous",40,September 2018,"I loved The Haven Suites, we had a two bedroom and it was ideal for us and the two kids. Daily breakfast was lovely and all of the staff were excellent. We found the suite pool are nice and quite and very clean with great shade provided by the trees.

I'm unfortunetly recovering from a broken leg and we were relocated onto the ground floor closest rooms to the suites reception and we were also provided a free of charge wheelchair for the duration of our trip.

The rooms themselves weren't 5 star but we didnt pay for 5 star and they were more than I had thought although finishes were a little tired looking, it would have been spectacular at first build (broken floor tiles, stains on chairs, water damage around bathroom etc) these faults are due to time, wear & tear and previous holiday makers, all in all, if we go back to the area again, I'd have absolutely no second thoughts of rebooking the suite accommodation :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
555,Villa Bella!,50,September 2018,My husband and I were recently in Bali and decided to end our vacation with 2 nights at the magnificent Haven right in downtown Seminyak. The location is fantastic and it's easy to walk everywhere. The best decision EVER was upgrading to the private villa with a private pool. So gorgeous. So romantic. So private. And right in city center! My only suggestion would be making it easier to find the beach area- each time we walked to the beach we were unable to locate the area that was intended for the Haven resort. We didn't look to hard I will admit though as the BSB club was right there and we spent the days in their loungers with great staff. :),The Haven Bali Seminyak
556,"Amazing staff, amazing price",50,August 2018,"Been using this establishment several times
One thing i like from this hotel is their staff.
Amazing friendly staff, well trained
The room above expectation compare to its price
Located in the center of Seminyak. Easy access from main road, walking distance to the famous Double Six beach Seminyak.
And its just 30 minutes to the airport",The Haven Bali Seminyak
557,"The Haven the great hotel!! Clean, friendly and good location!!",50,September 2018,"Very impressed!! The hotel staff gives us wonderful smile all the time. I recommend to stay at the suite which is much more quiet and relax. The hotel has beautiful spa and massage. So you don't need to go other shop. The location is just in the shopping area. Only a minute walk to famous Bintang Market and 30,000 - 50,000 irp to the most of area by taxi. Very Good hotel.

Special thanks to Ms Eruna in guest relations who gave us Heavenly good time.

558,Great place to stay in Seminyak,40,September 2018,"Spent a week at The Haven and it was totally enjoyable. Free wi-fi, nice rooms with balconies overlooking the pool. The included breakfast buffet was amazing with a large selection of items to choose from, from American style breakfast items to Indonesian fare, it was all very good. Set on a busy street with shopping and the beach in walking distance at Double 6 beach, and the hotel also provided free shuttle service to their exclusive beach club area there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
559,Close to all the action,40,November 2017,"We stayed at The Haven Suites twice last year, once with our daughter and once just the two of us. The configuration of two bedrooms with ensuites either side of the lounge, dining, kitchen area worked a treat for the three of us while the ability to just have one bedroom and the lounge area at a cheaper price for the two of us was perfect. Breakfast is included in the tariff and a good selection is on offer.
The Haven is in an excellent location, close to restaurants, boutiques, homeware shops and Bintang Supermarket in JL Raya Seminyak, as well as being only seven minutes stroll to Double Six Beach. If you don't want to walk there is a regular complimentary buggy service between the hotel and the beach.
On my first trip I had come out of hospital just two weeks prior and found the bath in our ensuite impossible to use because of its overwide edge. Fortunately in the second bedroom there was a shower. However, we found that it was not possible to have the bedroom with a shower when the room was divided the second time we stayed. Getting in and out of the bath could be a problem for older guests.
Although there was a kitchen with a cooktop there were no pots, pans or utensils so it appears cooking in the room is not encouraged. There are so many restaurants with reasonable prices to choose from in the area this is not a problem unless you have special dietary requirements and need to prepare you own meals.
As our departure flights were late at night the staff were very helpful and allowed us a 4pm check out at no additional charge.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
560,Thanks Haven for a relaxing time.,40,September 2018,"Great hotel, clean, tidy and friendly. We had a happy week in a twin room which included the buffet breakfast which was great. Need to be careful with the added extras as this can add up. We declined the $125 deposit at the beginning and paid as we went which was better for us as we didn’t have to feel we were tied into spending money at the hotel but often chose to for convenience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
561,Poor service and low standards,20,September 2018,"I wouldn’t stay here again after our experience. We had to wait an hour at check in at 3pm as our room wasn’t ready - we were offered a welcome drink (a small orange juice) at the bar before we were escorted to our room. Many of the staff struggle to speak English and lack the ability to explain the facilities or give us basic information you would expect to receive - considering it’s a large hotel you would think an overview would be provided on arrival. It felt like I was a hassle when I asked any questions.

Pictures attached of our room - we are very disappointed.

The rooms need renovating and lots of things need replacing or repairing. I complained about our room and after three phone call conversations and a very confused trainee employee who couldn’t speak English at our door - we were offered a different room. No one seemed interested or concerned about the standard of the room or why we were disappointed - it feels like they receive complaints frequently and bandaid the problem rather than finding solutions.

3 hours after arriving here, we moved to a new room which is an improvement from the first one (slightly more modern and cleaner) but as a couple travelling we are now in single beds and have lost any excitement about staying here another night. I don’t believe this is anywhere near 4 Star accommodation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
562,Great location,40,September 2018,"Stayed here with my sister in a 2 bedroom suite in September. The location of this hotel is fantastic - you are right there on JL Legian where all the action is, yet the suite that we stayed in was set back from the main road so it was very quiet and tranquil. And you're only a 5 minute walk away from Double 6 beach.

The grounds are immaculately kept, and the swimming pool was always a crisp 23 degrees which was a necessity on 30 degree days!

The suite itself was well appointed, lots of room. Quite a number of cracked floor tiles showed the age a little, and the shower heads in the rooms showed discoloration due to the poor water quality in Bali and could probably stand to be replaced. The lounge/kitchen area of the suite was very nice and well laid-out, however providing a kitchen space with cooktop, yet the only kitchen amenities of cutlery and crockery meant you couldn't cook in your room. It's not a major concern as restaurant options nearby are plentiful and extremely affordable.

The staff were welcoming and friendly, and always ready to assist.

Breakfast inclusion was varied, with Eastern and Western options available. The fresh fruit was a little lacking, with only watermelon, pineapple and paw paw available most days which was a little disappointing.

Restaurant meal options were varied and priced as expected for a resort. Drinks were on the higher price point, although all day happy hour 2 for 1 mojitos were good value.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to anyone, although it is especially good for Bali first-timers as the location is central to everything.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
563,Great stay,40,September 2018,"Stayed here with my mate for a week. The food was excellent and the staff were very friendly. We had a room with two single beds which was perfect, the room was very clean and perfect for our needs. The food was very good however could sometimes take a while to come out, apart from that we had a great stay and I would definitely return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
564,Awesome Place,50,September 2018,"Its been a pleasant stay with you.
I put my choice to haven seminyak following the all good reviews.
I made my booking last minute.
And yes its true.
The first impression is awesome, when i got problem with my booking and all acvount, Arya at front desk is very helpful, he did extra mile to help and make my stay with you more memorable.
The room was big for me
All the staff was very friendly
The hotel place near by many nice place.
Food was lovely.
But unfortunately i only stay for a couple of night.
But i will be right back
Thank you for the great and nice service",The Haven Bali Seminyak
565,Good services and friendly staffs,50,September 2018,"Nice stay in The Haven Seminyak for 2 nights!! (Birthday trip)
On the first day when I arrived to The Haven Seminyak hotel, the room type that I originally booked was full... At that moment, I was a bit disappointed because they didn't manage to give me the room that I booked. BUT, the staff told me no worries, because they will upgrade me to another room which is bigger and nicer than the room I booked. When I hear that I was so thankful for their great arrangement, of course when I enter the room I can't imagine that they were upgrade me to the 1 bedroom suite that is face to the swimming pool. The room is so big, clean and pretty. It's really make my birthday well spent in The Haven Seminyak. Other than the room, the staffs are all friendly and helpful. Every morning when I see them, I feel so warm with their smiles. The staffs will say hi with a very welcoming smiles every time I meet them. The security guard are also very professional as everytime when I get down from the taxi the security guard will help me to check the taxi seat whether have I left something in the taxi only let the taxi leave the hotel.
Overall, this hotel is nice and really worth to stay here for 2 nights!!
Definitely will come back again when I visiting to Bali next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
566,Hard to beat value for a family,40,September 2018,"We are a family of 5, kids aged from 6-11. We find it very hard to beat the value you get here if you stay in a double suite. Breakfast buffet has a great range, rooms are very large. Staff are beautiful - English sometimes makes it an adventure.

That being said - their could be some updates done on the furniture in the suites (or even a real good clean!), tiles in rooms are showing wear and tear. A microwave would be handy in the suite too for a family.

We would stay here in a heart beat. The location is close to the action, the beach, short taxi to eat street, barber, Bintang supermarket (and there are cheaper local places to stock up on drinks).

We will be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
567,Nice 4 star hotel in the heart of Seminyak,50,March 2018,"Stayed many times in this hotel. Location is in Seminyak center, walking distance to shop and restaurant. Huge room, breakfast is simple yet tasty, internet connection is so-so but still workable, and service is execellent!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
568,Perfect Holiday,50,August 2018,"We had a really enjoyable 24 night stay at the Haven. Our room was large (Suite) and was very clean. All the staff were just so nice and went out of their way to make our holiday hassle free. The food and staff at Lemon Cello restaurant were amazing. Honestly if you stay here try eating in a few nights, you won't regret it. Five Star service will be provided by Sugi, Riyani & their team. Buffet breakfast also had all you could want.

Guest Service Manager - Ernita is such a huge asset to The Haven. Checking up on us every few days to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Nothing was too much trouble to her.

We got the pleasure of experiencing a 2 hour pamper at The Haven Spa which was very relaxing. The staff in the Spa were very attention to detail to my requests.

Thank you to all the staff at The Haven for all you did for us during our holiday. A special thank you to Ernita, Sugi & Riyani for being so amazing. Sugi's dedication to his position there is a credit to him.

A message to General Manager - Marak Setiadi - The most outstanding team member of our stay was Riyani in Lemon Cello. You are so lucky to have her on your team.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
569,Sit back and chill,40,September 2018,"Popped in for a drink and something to eat.

Over looking the road sitting at the front of the hotel restaurant is a petty cool place to sit and watch the world pass by.

The food was good quality and wasn’t priced too badly at all for a hotel.

We had pizza and a burger. The burger was delicious (my order), me Partner had the pizza....there was some food envy :-)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
570,The Haven,40,August 2018,"Our stay in the Haven didn't start as we wanted as we soon realised that the amazing pictures on the Internet were of the Suites and area of the hotel associated to the Suites only. The area for all other accommodation was really dated and had these awful cage like features which look very prison like.

After a lengthy and difficult discussion with the management, we finally paid an agreed amount to upgrade the the Suites.

The Suites were a great size, however, were quite dated and looked like it could do with a good face lift. Due to the enclosed pool area it was constantly in shade, which is great if you want some respite from the heat, however, not great tanning conditions!

The hotel is a 10 minute walk to the beach and is probably closer to Legion than the centre of Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
571,The Haven,40,August 2018,"Recently stayed at The Haven in Seminyak. I only paid for one of the cheaper rooms but it had all we needed, nice bathroom, comfortable beds and a balcony overlooking the pool. The grounds are well kept by the staff.
The buffet breakfast was good a selection of western and Indonesian which I like.
The location is good there are plenty of shops a 7/11 store opposite for water, snacks and money changer.
Lots of good eating places as well.
I would recommend this hotel for everyone from families to singles.
The only thing I could fault is they only provide two very small bottles of water per day instead of the usual standard size.
All in all though a good stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
572,Very average,30,September 2018,"We have just spent 5 nights in the Haven Seminyak, previously we came from Ubud in a cheaper hotel which was 10x better! When we arrived we were told check in wasn’t until 3pm which wasn’t an issue, we then came back at 3pm to find out our king size room wasn’t available until the following day so we would be in a twin room for that night. We did ask why and they advised it depends what’s available on day - not great considering it’s what we booked. The twin room was disappointing not only having to sleep in single beds but the view was facing a white wall and the door didn’t shut properly. We then moved to our king size room which was pretty standard however we did have a pool view! The balcony doors don’t shut properly so be aware of mosquitos even though there is a net. The shower didn’t work however they did fix it that day but basically jammed the plug so it would work and we then couldn’t have a bath and it would decide when it wanted to go hot. The rooms aren’t similar to the pictures but they are good enough if you don’t plan on spending your time in the hotel. The pool looks lovely but we never tried it as there was no atmosphere or a lot of beds, you don’t get any shading (umbrellas). Drinks are ok but you can get better down the road! Didn’t try the food either however breakfast always looks busy! On the positive it was a great location and walkable to the beach (must try!!) and a lot of nice restaurants. We did go into seminyak square, potato head and ku de ta while we where in Seminyak all 30 min walk or get a taxi for 80,000 - 100,000 (be aware taxis where cheaper on the way back!). Staff where plesant but not above and beyond, no personalised touches.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
573,Wonderful holiday !!,50,September 2018,"We are comming to the end of our 9 nights stay holiday and all I can say is this place is just fantastic!! We have been well looked after, the food is great and the service is friendly and helpful.
The rooms are tidy and clean, comfortable bed and aircon is great. There is the odd smell in the bathroom but you’ll get that anywhere you go ..
I would recommend this place to anyone and I hope to be back one day.
Thank you",The Haven Bali Seminyak
574,Happy Honeymooners,50,September 2018,"The room was great. Clean, modern and a nice view of the pool. Staff were amazing from day one till the day we left.

The staff took the time to remember our names, room no. and any other info we may have mentioned. Made you really feel cared about.

Breakfast buffet was lovely. Plenty of options to choose from. Loved waking up to it.
Gym is a little small, but had a decent setup to do a semi decent session by hotel standards.

Pool was a little cold, maybe needed a few more degrees, but otherwise good length and decent amount of seating.
Beach club was nice when the pool was too busy.

Loved the area the hotel was in too. Plenty of places to eat around there and not as crowded as the other parts of seminyak.

Would stay here again for sure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
575,"""Centrally located and great service""",50,September 2018,"The reception staff that we came across were amazing, and our credit especially to Yosua and Bagus for their good job done.
Hotel is lovely but showed signs of aging and most probably in needs of refurbishing as bathtub and washbasin doesn't drain properly after use and tiles line along the bath tub are mouldy. The room that we got on a higher floor is bright and airy, clean and has strong wifi signal, so that weighs up all the cons mentioned.
We enjoy the included buffet breakfast as it has a selections of western and local traditional food and the some of its food selection change everyday.
In fact all the hotel staff are so friendly and helpful and that includes the security guards standing outside whom are always ready to assists you with your luggage or helping to stop the traffic when you are crossing the street.
This hotel is so centrally located that almost anything or everything that you need is just
within reach. We love this place and would definitely make this our choice of hotel when we are on holiday here next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
576,Thinking of booking the Haven?,30,August 2018,"I have just spent 1 week here with my husband. It's a nice hotel but a lot of areas to improve on. We had breakfast included...fantastic variety of breakfast but the hot food was always cold!!
The pool area is basic with little shade as don't have umbrellas and 2 trees! Only a. Few sun beds. No music there and with the layout of the hotel approximately 40% of the pool is under the rooms The water is always quite chilly.
The hotel is quite pricey for its beers, juices etc.
The Ta I pick up from airport is very expensive, 330000 rupiah. So don't book it. We got a taxi to airport for coming home and cost was approximately 100000 rupiah.
I asked for an extra blanket and was told they are not supplied.
Staff were lovely and rooms not bad but showers are a bit grubby in corners. The rooms at the front can be noisey as the hotel is situated on a Main Street.
I believe there is nicer hotels for the price. I also overheard other people saying the same thing.
I wouldn't stay there again considering other places I have stayed.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
577,"Friendly staff, central location",50,August 2018,"All round this was a lovely hotel. The rooms were in good condition with all the amenities needed. Close to shops, 10 minutes walk from the beach! My only concern was there weren’t enough chairs to lay on by the pool. But would 100% stay again! Breakfast also has a wide selection of buffet options!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
578,Nice!,40,August 2018,"The hotel service was amazing, along with the cleanliness. Our room was cleaned everyday with new towels and clean bedded if wanted. Only thing I can really pick on was the view from our room... which was a wall which made the room completely dark. Could have maybe discounted the room considering we paid the same as everyone else.
But overall, amazing stay, good location on the main road and everyone willing to help even the security guard who helped us book a last minute taxi to the airport when ours failed to turn up on time.
On arrival because we stayed for over 8 nights me and my partner had a free massage each.. which was AMAZING.
Would definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
579,Awesome!! Great Value with Breakfast Included,50,July 2018,We stayed here last month and returned three times in between travelling around. The Staff are all fantastic and attentive. The rooms are fabulous. The food is great. A huge variety of food to choose from with the included breakfast. Great 2-4-1 cocktails. The best massages at the lovely spa. Two awesome pool areas to swim and relax by. Fantastic location with all the shops on your doorstep and the beach a 10min walk away. We could not fault this awesome place one bit. Thank you The Haven we will definitely be back !!!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
580,Mini break in Bali,50,August 2018,"We stayed here for a mini break and found it absolutely wonderful. The staff were all so welcoming and friendly. The room was beautiful and spacious with daily cleaning, and replenishing of toiletries as required. The pool areas were lovely in green leafy shade, with reclining seats and towels available from the hotel.
The food was plentiful, fresh and nothing was too much trouble for the staff if you wanted something else or extra.
The evening meal choices and entertainment were great too.
A lovely place to stay for a mini break, friends break or holiday - The Haven caters for all.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
581,It is a happy place!,50,August 2018,"Great location, well designed, and good customer service. It is very close to Double Six beach, and surrounded by a lot of restaurants, shops, supermarket, and even pharmacy. We had a chance to talk to the GM Mr. Marak Setiadi - a leader with such beautiful and happy spirit!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
582,Great location and even better staff!,50,July 2018,"I recently had a weeks holiday with my son staying at The haven Seminyak. What an amazing stay it was. The location is just fantastic, close to the beach with many restaurants, bars and beach clubs within walking distance. The hotel facilities were great from the 2 pools to the restaurants with many different food thyme nights and great buffet breakfast options . Lastly I found the staff all around the hotel to be amazing and friendly, always giving us the warmest of greetings each day in particular the front desk lead by Ms Dayu where nothing was a problem from check in to check out. the Haven is now my go to place in Bali and I cant wait to get back there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
583,Pleasant stay,40,August 2018,"Stayed here for 5 nights in a twin room on the pool level. Was great with the balcony that led out to the pool I would request these rooms if they are available. Room was comfortable the beds weren't too bad it was just a bit noisy, could hear whenever people were walking past and noisy trolleys being pushed by early in the morning. Breakfast buffet was great with lots of options. Reception was terrible the staff were extremely slow and we had to wait ages to check in and out and any time we wanted to ask anything.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
584,Ok,40,August 2018,"well designed hotel, rooms spacious enough, service friendly. 10 minutes to the beach but still very good location if you like nightlife as well. Evaluation depends on the price you pay for the rooms. (Room about 100 €). Breakfast big choice, however quality can be improved). Coffee lovers should avoid the breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
585,"Tranquil, relaxing and great location",40,July 2018,"The Haven is well-located in Seminyak, towards the Legian end. The Haven is in several sections, near the main street is the Sabine Restaurant, then there are the standard-size hotel rooms, then the Villas, then the suites and finally the Lemon Cello restaurant, and from here there is an entrance to a smaller back street.

Our booking was for one of the suites and included buffet breakfast. Our room was on the second floor.

Check-in was fine; although a group had just checked in so the Reception area was a little crowded. The staff also seemed a little pre-occupied as you'd imagine. We were shown to our room, which was a couple of minutes walk from Reception.

The room was lovely and spacious. The living area included a kitchen with cook-top and sink; dining table with four chairs, lounge and TV. The bedroom had a second TV. The bathroom was a reasonable size and had a shower-over-bath which was a little awkward to access. The bathroom seemed a little dingy, lighting was a bit dull, and starting to look a bit tired as were the towels.

There was plenty of storage - especially if using kitchen drawers. The bed was comfortable. But our favourite feature was the balcony - which included a double-day bed. Perfect place for unwinding.

There were two pools, one near the suites and one near the standard rooms. The one near the suites was in shade most of the day - so not conducive to sun-baking. It also meant that the water seemed cold. However as a quiet courtyard for sitting and reading, a lovely place to be.

For breakfast we could eat either at the Sabine or Lemon Cello Restaurant. There was more variety at Sabine, but it was more crowded and noisier being near the main street. Whilst the breakfast selection wasn't huge it included cereals/muesli, bacon/sausages, baked beans or tomatoes, Indonesian options (one morning an amazing prawn and tempe dish), sushi, fruits and salad, egg station offering eggs in various styles and pancakes/waffles. Tea, fruit juices and coffee. And a selection of pastries. Very acceptable.

The gym was quite small, not much room for doing things other than using the equipment provided.

The Haven also has a beach club, which is about 14 sun lounges in a roped-off section of the beach. There is a courtesy bus that will take you there - or it's about a 10 minute walk. It's a nice place to sit and watch all that's going on. There is no catering available - would be a great location for a cocktail and to watch the sunset.

We found the Haven very comfortable and loved our room, the pool being in the shade was a little disappointing. We would be happy to stay there again.

.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
586,Beautiful hotel!,50,August 2018,"We had a fantastic stay at The Haven, Seminyak and would thoroughly recommend it. The location is good - only a 5/10 minute walk from Double Six Beach with lots of shops and restaurants nearby. It also felt very safe, with security guards at the front and the pool area being set back from the busy main road, inside the complex.

The staff were amazing - all very friendly, impeccably polite and speaking good English where required.

The pools (there are 3) were great for swimming and chilling out, although one thing to be aware of is that a large majority of the sunbeds are in the shade for most of the day due to the overhanging palm trees and the layout of the hotel. However if you get there early enough it's easy to find a good spot.

Overall, excellent value and a really great hotel. Lots of food and drink offers and the breakfast in particular is very good. We loved our time here, thanks!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
587,Nice Hotel & Great Location,40,August 2018,"A nice hotel in a great location, right on the Main Street of Seminyak. Walking distance to everywhere. We stayed in 2 connecting suites as I have two older sons. It was nice enough, abit outdated and definitely need maintenance in some areas, however, in future we would definitely book the private villa, they look excellent. Breakfast was good, all the usual options available and the staff were pleasant and friendly for, although not as attentive as other hotels in Bali where we have stayed, but this is a 4 star.
Not enough sunbeds around the pool and the decking is abit outdated and has awful smell coming from underneath, no where near enough beds for the size of both pools. Has a free shuttle bus to take you beach club but we didn't use, rather walk instead. We will stay again but in Villa, this hotel is in great location for shopping and plenty of good surrounding restaurants in the area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
588,Great Lication,40,August 2018,"A lovely hotel in a great location on the Main Street on the Seminyak/Legian border.
I stayed in a Haven room which was fine for me travelling solo. I would recommend staying in a suite or even villa if your budget allows and your travelling with others.
Breakfast was good, all the usual options available.
Staff were pleasant and friendly although not as attentive as other hotels in Bali where I have stayed.
Sunbed availability can be an issue on a sunny day when the hotel is busy. Not really enough beds for the size of the hotel although there is the beach club also with a free shuttle bus to take you there.
I was there during the earthquake which I must say was terrifying. We were evacuated onto the street. There was no information/reassurance provided by the staff/ management either on the night or the next day.
A letter with information would have been appreciated.
Great location for shopping and good restaurants in the immediate area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
589,"Lovely setting and staff, but can’t avoid the smell of cigarette smoke",40,August 2018,"We enjoyed our 11 night stay in July and August.

The check in after hours (10:30pm local time) was frugal and felt a little unorganised, we received a drinks voucher to use during our stay but would have preferred one offered immediately as every other accomodation has done for us.

The adjoining rooms were excellent and spacious ! We loved them.

The breakfast was not the largest buffet and no chef there cooking soup as we are accustomed, but the chef was there for egg choices. The staff there were superb! The breakfast was beautiful and although less choices, the food was fresh and tasty and we all loved it!

But when having breakfast downstairs at lemon cello we found every morning a smoker would light up somewhere and ruin it for us. I am an ex smoker, and my entire family hates the smell of second hand smoke with their meals, quite normal really. Oddly, we could not be seated away from the smokers, who ruin it for all. Staff don’t seem to understand or empathise that it stinks and ruins the meals for the majority of others who do not smoke.

On another Occassion, we were seated in the front restaurant , only to have smokers there too, dine elsewhere I say, where non smoking areas are available.

We were here during the 6.4 and then 7.0 quakes in Lombok which shook the Bali hotel and created many cracks with plaster dust about the room floors and stairwells etc. The Hotel Maintenace were onto it quickly. Credit to them.

But lucky I had wifi to learn about the quake, I found it odd that there was no announcement from staff or via a subsequent letter or message to the rooms. According to all we asked, it was one of the biggest quakes to rock Bali during their lifetime yet no message/s from the hotel to comfort us nor explain their maintenance.

The staff were lovely whenever we interacted with them, we love Bali and enjoyed our stay here overall.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
590,Great Hotel,50,August 2018,"we stayed in a 1 bed suite, it was huge! Sure they are a little tired but great value for money. The pool is lovely surrounded by the Palm trees and it is a lovely place to eat breakfast.
So many restaurants and cafes only 5 mins from your door, some great choices.
It's far from perfect but you aren't paying top dollar and great value for money. Would happily stay here again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
591,Great Hotel,50,March 2018,"Very nice big, clean rooms, modern and new. Loved the sunset view, pool is magnificent. Try for a pool entry room if you swim a lot. Breakfast was great but the dinner was hit and miss, Indo buffet was great but don't order the duck from al la carte menu, there is no meat at all. Staff are attentive but not intrusive, very friendly and helpful. Love the Canggu area, bit of a mission to the beach over a little river which was not an issue for us but might be for some.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
592,Good but...,30,August 2018,"Was supposed to spent 3 nights at The Haven Bali Seminyak but our trip was cut short due to the earthquake in Lombok; it happened on our first night so we decided to leave on the second day. The hotel was nice enough to refund the rest of the stay, but due to the payment via credit card, the refund is going to take at least 14 working days.
1. the check-in was alright. The staffs were very attentive and helpful. We were welcomed with a welcome drink so that was very refreshing after our long ride from Ubud.
2. Told the hotel we were on our honeymoon, they went a little extra to set up special amenities for us.
3. Breakfast is alright. They have a wide range of varieties from pancakes to omeletes to bread to cereal to rice to fried rice, and a variety of fruit juice, fruits, and dessert as well.
4. The earthquake happened twice; we requested a change of room to one nearest to lobby and the staff quickly checked and helped us with the move. They also prepared an apologizing letter and a small dessert for the inconvenience the day after, not that it’s any of the hotel’s fault.
5. Truthfully, not worth the price. The room is small, the bathroom isn’t designed to my personal taste, very inconvenience (though a lot of people seem to prefer it that way).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
593,Restaurant & Bar Review Only,40,July 2018,"We went here a couple of times to eat...
I highly recommend trying the taste of Indonesia tasting plate, was Sensational!
Every meal we ate here was good.
the service & staff were excellent.
Will definitely go back there again... hopefully next time we go to Bali the accommodation won't be booked out, it's a great location!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
594,Lacking attention to detail,30,July 2018,"One of the glasses in our room was broken upon arriving to our room. Room service options standard. Seemed to be confusion among front desk staff. Breakfast is a full spread, many different options for Eastern and Western cuisines. Two pools on site. The second pool in the back seems to be the quieter choice. Definitely not an exceptional stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
595,lots of space,40,July 2018,We had 2 adjoining rooms which were very spacious and adequate .Coffee making in the room was a plus .Our rooms also had a balcony overlooking the pool .Very quiet spot and away from the outside road noise .The breakfast was full on and catered for all our tastes. Great location and staff were all helpful,The Haven Bali Seminyak
596,Not worth the money,10,July 2018,"We stayed in the most expensive Pool Villa it was not worth the money we paid for it. Firstly, it was not 100% clean. There was blood on the bed net in the main bedroom, there were also some kind of blood stains on the curtains in the lounge room.

There were big beautiful baths in both rooms, we couldn't use them as it would take 3 days to fill with water and when it was filled the water was cold. There was a permanent sewage smell in the bathroom and toilet area of my room, I was the only in the room so I know the smell was not our smell as we were barely in the room.

We had no wifi in our Villa for 2 days.

Another day, we got a letter under our door informing us the electricity would go off at 11am for a short time, it didn't go off until 2pm and for much longer than they said it would. Lots of people upset about that.

Medical Certificate - we called a Dr for someone and had to wait almost 4 - 5 days to even get the Medical Certificate, they kept telling us they would bring it to us and they never did. When we went to retrieve it from front reception, they kept saying it was at the back reception, when we went to the other reception, they said the same thing... We had to chase it down.

The aircon in my bathroom barley worked.

The aircon in the top room of the Villa barely worked at all and twice leaked huge puddles of water all over the lounge room of the Villa.

Butler - there was no butler as advertised with the room, all they did was supervise the cleaners when they came.

The cleaners somehow threw out my very expensive mouth guard / splint which I sleep with, it was on my bedside table. I informed the hotel the next morning as I got home late that night and thought it was too late to complain late at night. This happened on the 8th, I informed them the morning of the 9th, the hotel asked me to give them until the 11th to investigate, I was under the impression they would cover the loss. When I showed them proof from my dentist of the cost to replace it, AUD $598, they hotel said we can't find it and you will have to claim through your travel insurance. They also informed me that I would have to file a police report, which I did. A BIG inconvenience, considering I did nothing to contribute to the loss of the splint.

The Haven told us they would compensate us for the continuous issues we had, but they didn't. We asked for a late check out, which they gave us and of course costs nothing. They also offered to drive us to the airport, cost to them is AUD $20. In the end they only gave us one car which could not carry all of us as there were seven of us and we needed two cars. No matter how much we argued that they would not budge, and we were forced to pay for the second car.

Although we got late check out which was at 4.30pm. Some of our friends got late check out of 6.30pm and they didn't even complain about anything.

We endlessly complained to Management about all of these issues, and they continued to tell us they were sorry over and over again, they also told us over and over again that they would compensate us, they never did.

This hotel was not worth the money we paid, especially for the Villa.

I complained to our Travel Agent who contacted them and asked that they refund us 3 days of the 14 days we stayed there. They offered to compensate us the AUD $20 for the second car, and they had sorted all of this out with us, which they absolutely did not. When the travel agent went back to them explaining that this was not good enough, they stopped responding.

Never again will I stay with them.

There are plenty of beautiful hotels in Seminyak you can stay who truly take care of their customers. We had lots of friends staying in Bali at the same time as us, but in different hotels and they were all well looked after, and very happy.

Don't stay here, if something goes wrong, they don't care and will do nothing to make you happy.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
597,Great service as usual,40,July 2018,"Love staying at the Haven. Staff always very helpful and pleasant, great value for money and perfect location. Thank you for finally upgrading your door keys. They used to have to get recoded almost daily, but now no issue. See you next time",The Haven Bali Seminyak
598,Very nice hotel,40,July 2018,"My wife and I stayed there for two weeks, the basic rooms have no place to store your clothes for that long a period, unless you want to live out of your suitcase,so we did upgrade to a one bedroom suite, well worth it, lots of storage,beautiful room overlooking the pool/ courtyard,the staff go out of there way to help you. There is a shuttle to the beach but we just walked, it was only maybe a ten minute walk. Although we really enjoyed our stay here ( today is our last day) next time we would book on the beach, just our preference, this location is great for shoppers though, right outside your front door. Thank you to all that made our stay great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
599,2 weeks in Paradise,40,July 2018,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 16 day stay at the hotel! Usually we'd go to numerous places, but decided the Haven would be the place for our stay. We thoroughly enjoyed it. The location is excellent! Some of the best shopping markets & restaurants very close by! We walked most places as the hotel is close to the beach and the Bintang supermarket just a 2 minute walk away. The beach loungers are also great! Would give the hotel a 4.5 star rating, the rooms are looking a little bit tired (few cracks here and there but nothing major) they also look like they are in the process of updating the rooms! The rooms were very clean!! Another not so great thing is the pool areas can be quite shaded, so pool was quite chilly but good for a quick refreshing dip! We found the breakfast to be excellent, so much selection, never got bored! The staff were also incredible, very friendly and helpful, always asking how your days going etc. Highly recommend staying at the Haven, great location, friendly staff & comfortable stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
600,As it name suggests,40,July 2018,This hotel provides sanctuary amid thw crowds in Seminyak. It is quite old but well maintained hotels (we stay at the suites hotel). The choice for breakfast is not as vast as I would've expected. We like the pool though.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
601,Loved our stay here!!,50,July 2018,"I have just returned from The Haven and I can’t recommend this lovely hotel enough. We had a 2 bed suite and it was so spacious. Everyday our rooms were cleaned and bedsheets changed...the staff were so kind and friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. We were central to all shops, bars and beach. The hotel pool was stunning and the breakfast every morning was fab! I just loved my trip to Bali and it was made even better by our stay in this lovely hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
602,The amazing trip to Bali,50,February 2018,"Hola friends , So this February I visited Bali for a 10 Days trip and I can't find words to compliment The Haven it is right in the middle of the city with beach not more than 800m away from the hotel.The rooms are huge with big sized Balcony and is a total value for money. The staff is very warming and makes you feel like home. They even found out that one of my friends birthday it was by looking at the passport and they gave a cake and balloons and sang happy birthday which is just not expected from a hotel. Bali all in all is a great destination must visit places will be Ku-De-Ta , La Favela, Sky garden , Rock Bar, Potato Head Beach Club, Bali Safari and Marine Park , Kuta beach. Happy Vacations !!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
603,Great Location,40,January 2018,"This is small yet quite comfortable hotel in Seminyak. Central location of this place is its biggest strength. We were with 2 senior citizens and 5 year old (+2 adults) and we could walk to nearby beach easily (hotel has a shuttle for same), at the beach had a area reserved for the hotel guests (neat!) where they give you towels and sunbeds (free). The food is expensive (compared to other nearby restaurants serving the same fare) so it makes sense to eat out.

The breakfast buffet has limited options if you are a vegetarian.

But the rooms are comfortable, clean and the service staff is quick.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
604,Excellent family hotel,50,May 2018,"I stayed at the Haven recently with my family in a family suite. The rooms was very modern and spacious, and big enough for our family of 5 to be very comfortable. The facilities at the hotel were very good, with the quality of the food excellent and well priced and the gardens around the hotel a real feature.

The staff of the hotel were exceptional, we stayed for 5 nights and every time there was an interaction with the staff it was met with a smile, a friendly greeting and helpful service.

The only detraction is the location is in a busy part of Seminyak, but once you walk through the lobby that's quickly forgotten. Well worth a look.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
605,Great Place - Good Location,50,July 2018,"We recently stayed for 7 nights in a 2 bedroom suite (family of 4 - 2 kids 13 and 10) and loved it. The suite was spacious and a great little oasis when we needed some chill time. The staff were amazing, so friendly and accomodating. All of our cheeks hurt from smiling and returning the ""hello, good morning, good evenings etc."" that the ever smiling staff greeted us with. The resort is in a great location, close to Double Six beach, many different restaurants and eat street is only a $4 Aus taxi ride away. There is plenty of shopping close by and regular shuttle to the beach (where a portion is sectioned off for Haven guests with beach lounges and towels). The hotel is at the front and the suites and villas are at the back. The restaurants are good, the food good but better eats can be found not far from here. The only downside for us was it lacked a ""resort "" feel. Otherwise a great place in a convenient location. We loved staying here and would be back for sure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
606,Nice and Relaxing Stay,40,July 2018,"Just arrived home from spending the last 5 nights in a 1 bedroom suite. Have stayed here many times before, it is in a really good location as it is central to everywhere and for the money it is excellent value.
I agree with other reviewers that it is looking very tired in the suites (bathrooms showing a lot of mold and mildew etc.) but it is important to remember that it is so well priced for what you get approx: $140 a night that you can overlook it. Breakfast is good, staff are always polite and helpful and the suites are so spacious that I will keep coming back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
607,"Wonderful, luxurious stay.",50,July 2018,"We stayed at THE HAVEN for a night in their private pool villa. The room was absolutely beautiful. Huge!!!! We got massages at the spa on location, Atma I believe it’s called. The massage was soooo worth the price. The breakfast was included and very delicious. Tons of variety options available. It was very clean and the staff was very helpful in all areas. I will definitely be staying here when we visit again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
608,Loved our stay at The Haven,40,June 2018,"We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite (2 adults & 1 child). The rooms were very spacious and the staff were all so lovely.

The breakfast was so good and there was so much to choose from (authentic buffet, bacon & eggs, sushi and salads, breads, cereals and my fav was a fresh croissant every day.

Would definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
609,"Hotel with great location, rooms and facilities",50,June 2018,"A great stay with spacious suite and all facilities. Nice pool, good breakfast, nice staff.
Having in-house spa but little expensive than outside. Having their own beach space from morning to eve 5:30pm only.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
610,Great for budget travellers.,30,June 2018,We had a family holiday and in total booked 5 rooms. Two rooms were ready at check in but the rest of us were put in rooms for 1 night then moved the next day. There were issues with lack of hot water and low water pressure in our first room and the second one wasn’t much better. We ended up moving again and the manager was good enough to upgrade us to a small suite. Most of the staff had trouble understanding us which added to our frustration. The bath towels are like rags and need replacing. On the plus side the pool areas are nice and the food in Sabeen Resturant is good value and tasty. If you are a family on a budget then it’s good value - just avoid schools holidays and public holiday periods as they seem to have trouble coping.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
611,Beautiful bali.,40,August 2017,Central Legian position. Clean rooms. Many different types of rooms. Good breakfast. Front bar area overlooking the Main Street area of Legian. Entertainment at night. Check in deask very efficient. Would stay there again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
612,"Fourth stay, even better!",50,June 2018,"We recently enjoyed our 4th visit to The Haven. In the past we had stayed in the one bedroom suites, but this time we decided on the one bedroom villa.
It was a fantastic experience as the villa was spacious, private, very quiet and came with a private pool.
In addition, we had our own butler Marcel and his staff, who provided amazing friendly, professional and personal house keeping services.
As usual, the friendly and attentive service provided by all staff at The Haven is a standout and the main reason we continue to return to this property.
The Villas are more expensive than the suites, but are well worth the extra cost to enjoy the benefits of your own private space.
The restaurant staff Ayu and Riyani always provide excellent service and we have enjoyed their company over several visits now.
Overall, the location of The Haven coupled with great staff will keep us returning in the future. Thank you to all staff for another great holiday experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
613,Great!,50,June 2018,"For our first trip to Bali we stayed here as per recommendation of a friend. The pricing is great compare to what you get in the actual room. The staff was attentive and friendly, and other than a short mix up on arrival, everything was nice. Have to give props to the reception staff, especially Arya for helpinf us with our requests and questions. The pool is nice, though the water isn’t very warm. Location is GREAT, and breakfast recommendations: try the pancakes paires with domestic juice.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
614,An enjoyable stay with some room for improvement,40,June 2018,"We have stayed here twice. Once this year and previously in 2015, both times we stayed in a 2 bed suite.
The staff in this hotel are fantastic and they really make you feel welcomed. Our flight was late arriving well after midnight and the reception staff were lovely and organised a quick check-in.
The aircon in one bedroom wasn't working well but within 20 minutes of informing reception, we had maintenance knocking on the door and we had no more issues.
The food here is of good quality and we ate several times in the front restaurant and attended the bbq pirate themed buffet.
The rooms themselves are showing signs of wear and tear but i can forgive that if the service is good and it was. We certainly enjoyed the barista coffee at breakfast and loved the variety of foods on offer at the breakfast buffet.
My only real gripe is the hot water in both bathrooms was rubbish so we had lots of lukewarm showers.
That being said, I would not hesitate to book again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
615,A Reservations Department that Communicates Superby Well,50,July 2018,"If you are reading this review, you, like me, may be considering booking at The Haven in Seminyak. We have a three week holiday in Bali pending and my preference, where feasible, is always to book directly with a hotel. Whether you make a booking depends on how well and quickly a hotel responds to any inquiries and if it provides the appropriate booking information for your needs and room-related requests.

We have found that certainly some hotels do not deliver when an inquiry is made. They may not respond in a timely manner or fail to communicate clearly and well. When a hotel excels with it's response and understands the nature of any requests I am always grateful. The Haven Seminyak is a hotel that has communicated well and has been a pleasure to deal with.

Their reservations section is on to it. Response has been clear, timely, and well atuned to the inquiries made. I have reviewed and stayed in many hotels over many years and The Haven's booking process has been one of the best. My advice is to liaise with Eko the reservations manager through the website and email contact.

The Haven has rooms, suites and villas with all the usual amenities and for us has distinguished itself by its service. The reservations manager stands out as an outstanding example of Balinese hospitality and assistance. Recently, some of the best reservation provision and superb service we have encountered has been in Thailand at both the Buri Rasa resort and the Sensimar resort on Koh Samui. Both are outstanding hotels that I have reviewed on Trip Advisor and The Haven in Seminyak has measured up to their high standard. Certainly when you receive such service you book with confidence. Even more so your holiday in prospect is one to look forward to.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
616,Stayed for 4 nights for our 25th Wedding Anniversary,40,May 2018,"Location of the hotel was good. It was only 10 minutes walk to double six beach, lots of restaurant and bar next door. The staff are lovely and so is the breakfast. Room are very spacey - we stayed in a one bedroom haven suite for 4 nights.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
617,Really great room,40,June 2018,"Booked a suite for 2 - cheaper to book directly with the Hotel than an online booking agent. Had personal contact then and requested a specific area to stay in. The suite was AMAZING! Especially for the price. The only criticism that I had is that the shower is over the bath - I much prefer a separate shower but had no control over that. The suites apparently all have the shower over the bath. The staff were lovely. The breakfast was ok but they were very very slow at filling the stations. Specialty coffees with breakfast in the Lemon Cello Restaurant are complimentary (capucino, latte etc) but there is a charge at the restaurant at the front of the hotel for those coffees. Omelets were great but a few times we waited 15 to 20 minutes and one time our order was forgotten altogether. But there were trainees on and they have to train somewhere and we were on holidays so it wasn't too big a deal. Would definitely stay here again in a suite.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
618,disappointing needs upgrading price increase less benefits,30,May 2018,"i have been coming to The Haven Hotel for 5 years now,the staff is what makes this hotel so nice,also as i am regular visitor i stay here sometimes 2 to 3 times a year,and i come on the off peak season and the Hotel does give me a free upgrade which is very nice of them to look after there regular customers,but the they are not listening or not keeping there word,i said 2 years ago about the rooms need upgrading the air/cons the floors the blackout blinds in both areas of the suites,and they told me in 2016 that renovations are about to start,the only renovations is there has been some painting of the interior of the buildings,the prices have gone up in accommodation and they have just put the prices up in the in room menu for example the pizzas which are frozen and heated up were 85,000INR are now 105,000INR,and other foods have also increased,but with the room charge increase is fair enough but the service provided is less so,am paying more for less,they use to have 2 hours in the evening for suite and villa stay guest free canopes and drinks in a club room,now stopped,mondays for 2 hours outside next to the pool they use to have for suite and villa guest outside they had a band and food drinks and a meet and greet the manager of each department now stopped,the driver that picked me up would not take me to the back entrance of the hotel because he did not want to spend extra time in the traffic,the drivers are are not full time with the haven they are contracters and most are nice but like the last driver i had some can be quite rude,,there is 2 entrances to the Haven the back is for the suites and the front for quest in the standard rooms it is a long hot walk from front to the back where the suites are,also no more welcome drink no more fresh cold hand towel on arrival,the rooms are dangerous the bath tub is high and when the floor is wet can be very slippery,the bedroom has blackout blinds but are not fitted so light still comes in but because the wall that divides the bedroom from the lounge room is smoked glass the light comes in,so if you are a light sleeper like me the light will wake you up around 6am,the floors are full of cracks furniture is old,there is not enough chairs for guest around the pool,i have been coming here 5 years and what upsets me most is they told me 2 years ago that the rooms will be getting renovated,and also the price increase with less benefits,but in writing these reviews i find the standard response thank you for staying at The Haven glad you enjoyed your stay we will address the issues you have mentioned,and of course nothing has been done,there are so many other problems like not enough hot water to fill the bath tub and much more to write in this review,haven staff are nice hotel looks nice but is cosmetic not practical",The Haven Bali Seminyak
619,Upsides and Downsides,40,June 2018,"The Haven was great value for money and in a convenient location between Seminyak and Kuta. For 6 nights we paid under $500 AUD for accommodation, which is great considering the facilities. They have beautiful pools, especially the one in the back of the hotel.

On the first night we were placed into a room without a view, and upon request the staff quickly moved us into a better room the following morning, which was great.

In terms of downsides, the room we stayed in (The Haven Room) was a little bit smelly and outdated, and we had some issues with the toilet because it started to smell of sewerage at the end of most days.

Also, on our trip back to the airport in Denpasar, the staff tried to rip us off by telling us taxis would be very expensive and that we were better off going with their service which would cost us over 200,000 rupiah. This was completely untrue and with a certified Bluebird taxi (we only used Bluebirds our entire stay in Bali), it only cost us around $6 AUD to get to the airport (keeping in mind it was peak hour).

We didn’t have the breakfast package included, so we paid as we went and this cost us around $11 AUD a day (which is pretty good). I recommend getting the breakfast package as they have a pretty good buffet selection in the mornings and it’s quite convenient. In terms of lunch and dinner, the food at the Sabeen restaurant is pretty average with a mixed range of prices.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
620,Fantastic,50,July 2018,"I really enjoyed my stay here. Staff are wonderful, rooms are clean, pools are great, other guests are lovely. I had the best time. Great location and very private. My friend loved it too. Comfy beds. We stayed in a suite. They are very spacious.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
621,Nice hotel in central Seminyak,40,July 2018,"Booked The Haven through booking.com and got a very good price on the room. Stayed from 25/06-02/07. The staff are very attentive and can not do more to help you. We had a room on the 4th floor - balcony faced out onto a wall and the sound bounced really badly so our first night was quite noisy, also we had very noisy neighbours which didn’t help. Our bed was also broken and propped up underneath with cardboard - as soon as we mentioned these problems the next morning they moved us to another room on the 2nd floor and it was 100% better.

Our stay was lovely. My boyfriend was pleased as they were showing the World Cup 24/7 in the lobby so he could watch all games.

The pool area can be a bit tricky - there’s not enough sunbeds for the amount of people staying. The front pool (with all the sun) has around 12 beds and you have to be up early to get those, and the back pool (no sun, all shade) has beds as well. We ate around the pool twice and had good food and service.

The beach area is about a 10/15min walk away, and is next to the double 6 beach area. The beach club could do with a bit of a tidy up, and possibly some partitions up to block it off from the main road a bit to make it nicer.

All in all a lovely hotel, with amazing staff members.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
622,The Haven was a really nice surprise,50,June 2018,"Great location in Seminyak as only 7 minutes to Double six beach where hotel provides beach sunbeds so you can enjoy a beach as well as the pool in the hotel. Room was great with excellent comfort beds and a balcony. Breakfast was great, staff was attentive and always with a smile.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
623,Great getaway,40,February 2018,Stayed here in February with three friends and the rooms were a great size. Plenty of lounge and kitchen space. Pool was nice and not far to some great coffee shops and general shopping. Would definitely stay here again and bring the kids.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
624,"Nice building, but let down by everything else",20,June 2018,"Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights. It's in a good location and the coffee shop area facing the street is a pleasant place to sit. The second pool, way down the back of the hotel, is also lovely. Took us a while to find it, as the staff didn't bother to give us any information at check-in. In fact, although we'd booked a queen bed room with 12 noon check-in months earlier, when we did attempt to check-in the staff tried to put us in a room with 2 singles because nothing else was ready. Not happy about that. The room we had booked was a 'pool-view' room.... which it kinda was - it you stood on tippy-toe on the corner of the balcony you could just see the pool around the huge wall directly in front of our balcony. The other thing about the room was that the staff slammed doors all night which noise travelled into the rooms... and I mean all night. One of the worst places I've stayed at for noise. The breakfast selection itself is very good-- but don't expect any of it to be hot. Even the hot meals were served cold. Not sure if that was intentional or if they just had forgotten to heat the food up. It was the same every morning though. I've been to Bali many times and this is definitely our least enjoyable accommodation. My recommendation - book elsewhere",The Haven Bali Seminyak
625,Clean & Tidy hotel.,40,June 2018,"I stayed here for 4 nights in a one bedroom suite. (If you can afford it a one bedroom suite is a must) The hotel was clean and the breakfast was also great. The hallways where the rooms are could do with some work. (a bit run down). Staff here were very friendly. Walking distance to a lot of restaurants and shopping. 10 min walk to the gay area & night clubs.
Overall the hotel looked better when I got there from seeing it on the website.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
626,Just what the Doctor ordered,40,May 2018,"After two earlier trips to Bali we decided to go one final time to that exotic and beautiful island. Because of the time required to get there (over 20 hours in the air) we decided on going for three weeks.

Our other visits involved staying in Nusa Dua and going by taxi or private drivers to other parts of the island. This time rather than spending so much time in taxis we decided to stay at four different resorts in four different locations.

It turned out to be a great idea. We in essence had four different vacations as each resort and location had different things to do. Our stops included Seminyak, Ubud, Nusa Dua, and Jimbaran

Our first Resort was The Haven in Seminyak. It was the least expensive resort we stayed at. It was rated the number 1 low cost resort in Seminyak. As I said before we wanted a resort in Seminyak for the location and The Haven was perfect. We got a one bedroom one bath suite with a kitchen, living room and dining area in addition to the bedroom. Breakfast was included.

The Haven also included a beach club. It was about a 5 to 10-minute walk to the beach from the Hotel. They also had transportation to and from the beach about every 2 hours. The beach club is at the edge of the beach. It includes loungers, towels, and there is a restaurant where you can use the bathroom facilities. The beach is huge, and you are a long way from the water. We didn’t use the transportation as we preferred to walk.

There is lots of shopping around the hotel and they include laundry service (a must if you are staying three weeks in the tropics). Also across the street from The Haven is a safe place to change money.

The breakfast was very good including both western and Asian choices.

The only negatives was the bed to me was not comfortable and the traffic is awful. We spent about the same amount of time in taxis as previous visits but we were much closer to our intended destinations.

All in all we were very pleased with the resort.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
627,Good centrally located hotel,40,June 2018,"Have previously stayed at this hotel which is partially why I returned again.
Centrally located in Seminyak, a 5 min walk to the beach (outside Double 6).
Rooms are starting to get a bit old and will soon require updating.
Breakfast is good which a very good selection.
Pools are good, but could benefit from additional lounges.
There needs to be better referencing to The Haven Beach Club. I only knew about its existence from a previous stay. There was no mention or reference to its existence during this visit, until I asked the front desk.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
628,This truly is a haven!,50,June 2018,Nestled within the hustle & bustle of Seminyak is the true meaning of Haven. The staff are absolutely wonderful. The room we stayed in was so clean & nice. The grounds are magical. Beautiful pool area & a delicious buffet breakfast with great selection. I cannot recommend this hotel enough! We will be returning. Thank you!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
629,Very nice hotel,40,April 2018,"Very clean and tidy hotel, friendly staff, well appointed rooms and good sized pool all go to making a stay here very pleasant. Located on a busy main road, giving access to plenty of shops and restaurants, but a fair walk to the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
630,Good Value,40,May 2018,"My daughter always booked this hotel for me. We always stay here when visited Bali. Me and my family love the hotel, good location and good service, always booked 1 or 2 bedrooms suite. But this time the room need more improvement and maintenance. The tiles broken, ac not cold.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
631,Very pleasant stay !!!,50,May 2018,"Very pleasant place to stay. Good service , friendly stuff , and Wulan at the front desk was very helpful!
The place is very clean and at a good location, very close to 66 beach. Would highly recommend!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
632,Our Best Stay In Bali,50,June 2018,"We absolutely loved our time in The Haven.
From the moment we walked in until the minute we left we loved every second!
It is a beautiful hotel with amazing staff.
We loved the gym & the amazing breakkie!
We will never forget lounging by the pool and doing the complimentary yoga!!
What a place, I will remember forever!
Thank you!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
633,Great place to stay,40,June 2018,"We stayed at the Haven bali for two nights and really enjoyed our stay there. When we got there they didn't haven't the room type we had originally booked and had to stay in a twin room for the first night. This room was still really nice, clean and comfortable. They upgrade us for the second night and we stayed in one of the suites. I would recommend this room as you also get access to a different pool which is a lot quieter than the main one. Breakfast was also really good and the hotel itself is well situated. We walked to the beach for dinner. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
634,Nice hotel,50,June 2018,"My husband and i love staying at this hotel. We have stayed here 3 times now. The staff are so friendly and are always smiling. We always stay in the suites they are really big and good value for the price. In a great location, walking distance to resturants, shops and bintang supermarket. The breakfast is really nice and a good variety.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
635,Good value but room for improvement,40,June 2018,"We booked a one bedroom suite from their website and got daily breakfast, 150k food credit voucher and 100k spa voucher, plus one way airport transfer. We only redeemed the food voucher for the steak and ribs buffet and didn’t avail of the spa or transfer. The buffet was ok, limited selection but fair enough.

The Haven offers great value- big clean rooms, good location, with access to a beach club on Double Six beach. The beach club is the main reason we went back for a second stay - nice corded off area on the beach with lounge seats, umbrellas, towels, bottled water and cold towels.

I would have given this a 5 star rating if the hot water worked properly. It is only hot for the first 5-8 mins or so when filling up the tub, then the hot water is gone, plus the tub drains slowly even when plugged so it was very frustrating. This also happened during our previous stay, also in a suite. We had to supplement the hot water by heating water in 2 electric kettles and a pot and pan on the stove. This took about 30 mins to fill up the tub, with the faucet on.

Another area for improvement would be to offer the shuttle to the beach club on an hourly basis instead of 9, 11, 1, 3 and 5 only. Perhaps on request on the other hours.

Our room also had late check out, but since they were booked, they could only give us till 1pm instead of 3pm.

Overall, would recommend but hope the hotel can fix the hot water concern.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
636,Excellent stay and amazing location,50,June 2018,My dad and i stayed here for 6 nights and have been coming here for 5 years now. We love it every time we stay. One staff member in particular has always been very good to us and another reason as to why we come back here. Dayu always goes out of her way to help us and make our stay pleasurable.We also stay in touch whilst back in Australia with her as she very thorough and understands our needs.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
637,5 star staff but 0 star rooms.,20,May 2018,"I really wish I could review the hotel otself and the staff separately, because the staff were wonderful.

The facilities however.. I wish I had booked a refundable trip, had I not paid in full I would have left on the first night - when the poor quality of the rooms had me literally in tears. Having stayed at hotels in a similar price range - with far superior facilities - I was thoroughly dissapointed.

Our first room was a 1 bedroom suite - where to begin - the shower in bath was covered in black mould in every crack and crevice, the tile floor was discoloured and stained as were the benchtops, the furniture looked old and ratty - everything looked like it hadn't been cleaned or maintained in the 10yrs that the hotel has been open.. the door to our balcony didn't lock. I went straight down to reception due to the appaling state of the room (at over $100 a night I expected far better than what we received) and was shown another room which, besides having a door that locked, was almost exactly the same.. mouldy and dank.

The next day we were shown both a junior suite and a standard room, we chose to downgrade ro the junior suite which was marginally better, there was a clean bath but the shower still had black mould around the bottom, the faucet made an awful shuddering noise every time we had a shower, the air conditioner leaked onto the floor leaving puddles of water to slip on.

The location was good.

The buffet breakfast was about average.

The staff were lovely.

But for the price - I wouldn't reccomend staying here, nor would i stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
638,Good Hotel with Lovely Staff,30,June 2018,"Stayed for a night in the Haven, the hotel is quite nice. Room was clean, and Staff were very friendly and helpful. Only thing about the room is the bathroom and toilet had glass walls, so not much privacy!! Pool was nice and warm, and buffet breakfast was good, really enjoyed the omelette station. Would reccomend this as a basic clean hotel, but be orepared for the bathroom !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
639,"Good Hotel, but stuffed up on the room",30,May 2018,"The hotel was good, amenities great but the only issue was that our room on the first day wasn't ready. We had requested a room close to the pool on ground level with a king bed but were put in a room with two single beds on an upper floor instead as they didn't have the room ready?!

Find this a little annoying considering we had booked this trip months in advanced. Didn't receive any discount for the cheaper room for the first night. Other than that once we were put in the correct room the next day, everything was great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
640,Heavenly Haven,50,March 2018,"Smack in the middle of Kuta and Seminyak Square is the relaxing Haven. Lovely rooms, beautiful pools, wonderful food, excellent service! It is very centrally located and affordably priced. I will definitely be staying here again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
641,The happy Haven,50,May 2018,"This was my 4th stay at the Haven in Seminyak and it never disappoints. The staff are delightful and friendly, our one bedroom suite was peaceful, comfy and spacious. The location is perfect for shopping and eating also 5 minute walk down to the beach.
I highly recommend The Haven Seminyak for business stay or leisure. Looking forward to my next trip to Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
642,Great Pools,40,May 2018,"The hotel itself is good, friendly staff and the Suite was nice with a large bath. My favourite part of the hotel was the Pools, specifically the one at the back of the hotel. It was quite and with the large amount of greenery makes you feel away from the city. The only downfall of the hotel was the quality of the food.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
643,Always a great experience,50,May 2018,"Very centrally located. Friendly staff. Great wifi. Beautiful gardens and pools. Affordably priced. Wasn’t my first stay, wont be the last. I’m not a huge fan of Seminyak so generally stay just a couple of days before heading off to somewhere quieter, but The Haven provides a great little oasis from the busyness of the area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
644,Best hotel & customer service,50,March 2018,"Stayed at The Haven Bali hotel in Seminyak with family and booked for a 2 bedroom suite for 6 nights. To our surprise these 2 rooms were both ensuite and much larger than we expected. Plenty of room for kids to play. Huge family area and dining area with all the facilities you need like fridge, freezer, gas, oven , kettle, crockery, dining table for 6. Plenty of storage in rooms , big showers, Both bedrooms and the family room had LCD screens. Big glass sliding doors opening to the pool view. Sun beds just outside the rooms in balcony. Staff so helpful and polite. Everyone of them with a smile and they wish you every time they see you or go pass you. Hats off for Reception staff, house keeping staff, restaurant staff, buffet staff. Hotel conviniently located. Security staff outside hotel always stop the traffic on road with a whistle for you to cross the road. Will definitely stay again happily here. Thank you Haven hotel for an amazing experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
645,Relaxing at the Haven,50,May 2018,"My partner and I visited Bali just for a week to celebrate our anniversary and was looking for a relaxed getaway. We stayed at a one-bedroom villa at The Haven and we were very impressed! The room was very clean, had a very comfortable double bed, marvellous bathroom and an amazing private pool! The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and one of them even went out of their way to help us with our SIM card dilemma. Despite the hotel situated off a main road, this did not ruin the relaxing ambience we had at our villa. In fact, it was close to a trusted money changer, supermarket and a variety of restaurants. It was also a close 5 min free shuttle to Double Six Beach. We also loved the daily buffet breakfast, and although it was repetitive, it was still delicious.
We definitely recommend this place!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
646,Great place,50,April 2018,"I had a great honey moon in there, a great hotel n a great place for vacation, i stayed in there between april 30 - may 3, although i've a suggestion about the omelette, it kinda dry everytime i eat it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
647,Wonderful stay at The Haven,50,May 2018,"Awesome hotel!

My husband and I arrived at 10:30pm on 15th May and the receptionist told us that we were given an upgrade to the deluxe room! Breakfast was good, with an Omelet Station, pancake/waffle/French toast station, and unlimited amount of pork sausages and pork bacon. We also went for the Atma Spa and it was a very good session.

The hotel is a 15 minutes walk from the beach and the hotel also provides free shuttle to their beach club.

What surprised and impressed me the most was that they sent over a birthday cake to the room on 17th May as they saw my birth date on my passport the day I checked in. They didn’t have to do that but they really went the extra mile just to make their guest feel at home. 2 girls came to the room with the cake and even lighted up the candle and asked me to make a wish!

Overall all the staff were very attentive and friendly. It was very comfortable staying there and I will definitely visit again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
648,Good value!,40,May 2018,"Stayed at The Haven for two weeks last week and it really is very good value. We had a two bedroom suite at the back overlooking the pool and it was very clean and spacious.

Breakfasts are the only problem here - I would suggest going to Grain to eat as it’s close and much more interesting.

Staff are wonderful but special mention must go to the little Trainee, Mega and the Hostesses, Shelfie and Desi.

A very enjoyable experience!

PS - great hair and nail salon over the road out front of the hotel - Charllotta - such fun and a bonus of French Bulldogs to play with!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
649,"NICE HOTEL, GREAT LOCATION",40,May 2018,"We stayed in a Haven Room for 10 nights. Beds and rooms very clean and serviced daily with friendly and attentive staff. The only compliant we had was the fridge did not work on our arrival and after being fixed was not very cold. But other than the fridge the room was great. The hotel has two pools, the one towards the front of the hotel is the one to go to if you want sun ( but only limited spots for sunlovers). The water is clean and refreshing. The staff service around the pool is excellent, they are keen to make your poolside experience enjoyable. The second pool is towards the back of the hotel and is the one you see in the advertising. It is a lovely location, very relaxing with all the greenery around. Again the pool is well maintained and the service is excellent. This pool is where you will be able to sit under an umbrella, the first pool we were told you cannot have an umbrella. This pool also has double sunbeds.
We only ate in the restaurant at the front of the hotel. Service is great, the staff are lovely. Happy hour is good value with a choice of cocktails on offer. Food was good, the Tikka Chicken was a favourite. Breakfast was included in the accommodation cost and was good, pretty standard choices there.
The location of the hotel is very good, you can walk to the beach (or catch the hotel shuttle) and is close to some good cafes and shops on Seminyak Road. There is always transport on offer at the front of the hotel if you want a taxi or scooter. We found the staff at the tour desk really helpful, in particular Ketut was wonderful. He took us to Ubud and was very informative on culture, politics and good places to visit.
All in all a good place to stay, I would stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
650,Afternoon meals and drinks,50,May 2018,"Stopped by in the afternoon for a meal and drink. Welcoming atmosphere, clean. Polite staff. Meals well presented and tasty. We had an Indonesian sampling plate and seafood laksa plus some cocktails. Good value for money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
651,need some maintenance,30,May 2018,"I was lucky to get an upgrade to suite room. The room was big with nice balcony facing the pool. However, the room seems to need some maintenance, especially in the bathroom. The hand pole in the bathtub was not tightly fasten hence you really need be careful. Both of my AC remote was not working properly, one was totally not able to be used.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
652,Good Experience,40,May 2018,"Our first trip to Bali. The Haven is located within a couple of blocks from Seminak beach, which is a fantastic spot to swim and chill out. First impressions of the Haven was that the rooms were somewhat tired. We occupied a ground floor suite in the rear highrise complex. It was obvious that the maintenance had not been kept up but the room was of a large size, a balcony with outdoor day bed. We found the service, outdoor pool area and restaurants ( 2 ) of a very good standard. Rate the hotel at 3.75 out of 5.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
653,Stay away!,10,May 2018,"Well located in Seminyak and surrounded by many restaurants and stores but if you are looking for typical and wonderful balinese hospitality and kindness,don’t go there! Staff is unfriendly. Some of them don’t understand English and don’t speak English. If you need a taxi don’t ask for help to the security men outside the hotel. They will call a fake taxi with no taxi meter and at the end of the ride you can find yourself (sborsare molto più del dovuto). Simply download “bluebird“app(a sort of Uber)and call it by yourself. A detta di molti bluebird driver,security men outside the hotel have a sort of “agreement”with fake taxi to share the high pay of the inconsapevole passenger. That’s disgusting! Furthermore,I asked to change my room because it was uncomfortable and noisy.They had availability so I packed my stuff ready to move. After 1hour minuets they called me back to tell me that they had no more room available. I got mad! I told them this was unfair behavior and voilà a room available magically appeared! Anyway, if you are looking for good sleep and tranquillity don’t go there! Very noisy! The hotel restaurant Sabeen is very expensive compared to the average prices in Bali and food is not so good!Service is very slow,almost 40 minutes wait for a salad! if you need something and call the reception and they tell you “I’ll call you back in 5 minutes“,they won’t do that! It happened to me more times! Restrooms in the lobby are stinky and dirty. When I booked my stay I was stricken by all the positive comments I read. So, my expectations were very high but they were completely neglected. I think that at The Haven they have so much work in progress!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
654,Worse service experience ever for international visitor!,10,May 2018,"I have traveled to quite a few places globally and had the opportunity to stay in great hotels, that personalize the guest. NOT here. Our room was 2 single beds instead of a double on check-in, we were met with a mere sorry, but you have to stay a night in 1 room and then will be moved to a couples room the next day. No sympathy shown for the inconvenience as guests, even when I ask to speak to the manager he showed no great ability to help or want to make the experience better for us. No offer of any complimentary service, even when we were asked it was met with a no. We now get to today, while we have been out this morning and quite tired, we now get back to hear that our new room is not ready and we have to wait to 3pm to check-in again. Once again no apologies, because apparently this is their customer service!! So we wait here, wishing we never came to this hotel and have to spend another 3 nights here. Please tell me how the Haven has a 4 star rating, as the guest is not paramount in its philosophy on service. Coming from the Novotel in Nusa Dua, this is chalk and cheese from the experience and service. Above and beyond for the customer...definitely not here! I will never return and be sure to tell my travel agent to never use or recommend the Haven again. Total disappointed, while I sit here still waiting for my room at reception!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
655,Second trip shocking!,10,April 2018,"Hello, David here. David Wilkins. Stayed from 20/4/18-30/4/18.
Had stayed previously and had a fantastic experience, so why wouldn’t we want to go back.
1. The first room was filthy and we were moved to another room which was adjoining which was cleaner but the showers were still dirty and flooded upon every shower, and subsequently have got a infection in my foot, which I went and saw a GP while I was there but anti biotics weren’t doing much as it was just getting more bad bacteria from dirty shower. good customer service though moving us to a cleaner room.
2. Ordered a birthday cake through the Haven 4/6 weeks before arriving for friends birthday. A New York Style bakes cheesecake. What came out looked great. However it was a sponge base with strawberry jam and then mixed with cream cheese maybe and cream. The birthday cake you gave me a refund which was ok, though I wasn’t impressed with the staff lack of attention to actually help me with the refund as this took arguing with two hotel managers to get my point across and they offered to make another birthday cake 2 days later!
3. The Haven did not offer us any form of reimbursement of any further kind after changing rooms or the cake dilemma.
4. The concierge that claims he works for hotel and drives the black van ripped us off driving us from The Haven to Spring Spa Seminyak for 100000k. We caught a taxi to Sarong which is next door and we’re only charged 30000k
5. I sent complaint to Your hotel main group PMH and have had no response. So I am contacting you.
Have sent 8 couples to The Haven hotel and sister hotel Double six over the last two years.
Also pics of the second bathroom, the one we were moved to room 406 is the one I was in. The shower flooded daily, I wanted to enjoy my holiday, so I stopped complaining and let the shower flood everyday out to drain. The DVD player in room 407 played DVDs for maybe 30mins and only in black and white.
So all in all, I have come home not feeling very happy about my over all stay at The Haven.
Daya the hotel manager was nice and helpful at the beginning of our stay but once I made a complaint about the birthday cake I had ordered well in advance a New York cheesecake which I also have pics of, she became rude.
What happens to the amazing customer service that was provided amongst the first holiday ? So upset.
I’ve messaged the Haven directly on messenger and they have offered one free night valid for 6 months! Seriously!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
656,Deb,50,May 2018,"Our stay here was amazing
Lovely rooms, staff were so accommodating quiet and breakfast was delicious
Pool and garden area so co and peaceful no traffic and you can swim at night
Highly recommend this hotel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
657,Very good service. Room needs upgrade though,40,April 2018,"Here we go.
Location. Spot on. Near to many eat places. Bintang supermarket. Even their sabeen resto serves good food.

Service
Smiles all around. Attentive. Almost instantaneous respons when aksed for something

Room.
Adequate size.
Nice mattress to sleep on
Amenities plenty

However room needs update. Already many rundown and tired spots.

Shuttle service to beach and a small beachclub is ready right smack on the beach.

Will probably comeback again after upgrade

658,Beautiful Hotel,50,January 2018,"The hotel is very beautiful, we live the place and the beach arround it. Front office agent (can't reacall her name ). She is very well knowledge, she provided us the best itenary for our holiday. We took the shuttle bus to the beach, kind of save our time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
659,amazing hotel!,50,April 2018,"Had an amazing stay here with the wife and 2 kids, Shuttle to beach is very convenient, good size swimming pool!. The Reception Staff are great and helped us a lot, very clean hotel, can't wait to go back!",The Haven Bali Seminyak

actually、I worried about English conversation、but Japanese speeking staff（Erna さん）helped me many things,I was happy during my vacation。Thank You for your help once more from my heart。
Korean speeking staff,Miraさんalso。
I strongly recommend this hotel/Resort、especially suite room。^_^
we'll be beach in 10min by walk also。
Thank You。",The Haven Bali Seminyak
661,Good atmosphere and staffs,50,February 2018,"I worked at Garuda and been travelling around Bali many times. I stayed for the first time with my friend here. I stayed for 3 days. The reception gave us warm welcome when we checked in. The reception named Febby was friendly and helpful. All the staffs were great taking care of the guests nicely. The location, facilities and food were also ok. When we would like to go to the beach, it was such a nice thing for this hotel provided us with shuttle bus. I will pick this hotel again for my next stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
662,Truly a haven!,50,April 2018,"There isn’t anywhere in Bali that beats the haven for location, atmosphere, suites, swimming pools, beach, food, staff and most of all value for money!
Do yourself a favour for not much extra money and get a deluxe suite, it’s a big generous space you could easily stay in for a week! The staff are professional and accommodating, the facilities and services are excellent and the location down near Bintang supermarket is great! We come to or stop through Bali a couple of times a year and we’ve tried all types of accomodation - 5 Star, villas and cheap & cheerful... we don’t even look at anything else anymore, we just head straight to the haven!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
663,"The Haven, Seminyak is great",40,April 2018,"This is the 2nd time my wife and I have stayed at The Haven. Our fist stay was in one of the 2 bedroom suites, they are excellent. This time we stayed in the one bedroom suite and it was quite good as well.
Staff are friendly, courteous and always willing to help.
Close to all shopping areas, bars, restaurants and cafes. 10 minute walk to Seminyak Beach and the fantastic La Plancha to watch the sunset.
Easy access to Legian and Kuta, you can walk to Kuta with a 1/2 hour leisurely walk
Breakfast is ok but not exceptional. Food and drinks are a bit expensive compared to many bars and restaurants in the area.
Pool areas are great. My wife and I will come and stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
664,Worth it!,40,April 2018,"After a long 13 hours flight, upon reaching the hotel we were greeted by the most respectful, humble staff of Haven Bali. Since we had pre-booked, without any delay we were handed over our room keys.

Our room was clean, fully equipped and the air con was just perfect. We had a small balcony, with pool view. The hotel is right in the center, so you have easy access to the market, restaurants, bike rentals, clubs.. all of it was just few steps away. (Although, renting a bike is still preferred as it gets too hot to walk)

The breakfast was standard with omelet station, fruits, local dishes, pancakes etc. They also had dinner buffet at night, however we didn’t try.

The pool is pretty amazing and often is not too crowded.

Overall, it was a good experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
665,Naturally Excellent,50,January 2018,Once again I stayed at the Haven during my last holiday in Bali. Their motto is Naturally Elegant but I would like to change that in Naturally Excellent. The service is best in Bali and all staff does know how to treat every guest as a valued customer. This time Erna and Arya from front desk gave me personal escort to the parking on the day I left. On my last night Rediana from housekeeping made my room ready for sleep one more time. He left me goodbye message with a towel sculpture. That is a way to say goodbye you will remember and makes the Haven absolutely my home again in Seminyak when I come back on my next holiday.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
666,Great Value for mini-break,40,April 2018,"Stayed for 3 nights as close to a friends Villa for birthday. Room v clean and good size for 2. V clean comfy beds & has tea in room (yay!) staff v helpful & friendly, nice breezy open bar/dining till late & good value overall... Good central location too.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
667,The Suites are wonderful!,50,March 2018,"I stayed in The Suites at this hotel and was glad we splashed out, as the other part of the hotel seemed a little noisier in the public areas (pool, restaurant) and reception a little less efficient. The Suites have their own lobby and a lovely tranquil restaurant and pool; the service from the staff was amazing and yes - its true what everyone says - the breakfast is very good! Our room was enormous and had 2 large balconies, one with an outdoor bed! Unfortunately i had a case of bali belly whilst on holiday but the hotel staff were very kind and checked up on me often, sending a lovely herbal tea to my room, breakfast and anything else i needed (including the hotel doctors!) . Cleaners were very efficient, coming every day and and nothing was too much for them. Only criticism was that in a room with a kitchenette i would expect some kitchen equipment but there was nothing at all bar cutlery! On request we were given a few items to cook with",The Haven Bali Seminyak
668,Excellent stay,50,March 2018,"We loved the Haven, one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The staff were really friendly and ever ready to help. The service was more than excellent. Loved the hotel so much and would love to come back. The location of the hotel makes it easy to shop around and enjoy the hustle bustle of Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
669,Great place and Friendly staff,50,February 2018,"We love the suite room , the reception staff was so friendly and helpful during check in and check out. The shuttle service was so amazing. Can’t wait for the next visit and will bring some more friends to stay at The Haven Hotel, Bali. Thank you. 😍😍",The Haven Bali Seminyak
670,To good that we extend our stay,50,April 2018,"I canceled the other hotels to extend my stay at the Haven Seminyak.Im so happy that we choose this hotel. The service was TOP and all the employe were all kind and sweet. They even called us by us name during our stay. We choose the upgrade to a Villa with private pool. Because of that we had free 90 minutes balinese massage and floating breakfast in the pool. Best choice ever made. The room is spacious and big. Room and pool were cleaned everyday. The breakfast was very diverse and big. You could get breakfast from local, european, english and american breakfast.

I want to thank the villa butlers Suastawan and Marcel for the pleasant stay. I was sick one day and marcel checked on me and advised me what to do. I was better the next day. Thank you so much Marcel. Also special thanks to Beppe, Erna and Dayu from the reception. My boyfriend came with a impossible request and they made it possible. Erna went all the way to Denpasar to buy the requested roses etc. Within a few hours while having a tour they made up the room and bath full of roses. Furthermore I want to thank Desi, Lina and Dedika. I will definitely come again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
671,GIRLS BALI TRIP,50,April 2018,"I would like to thank all the staff who were just amazing, especially the lady in charge at breakfast. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa, as you can see from the pics was JUST AMAZING.
The location was great and our villa was just so peaceful. We had the best of both worlds, the privacy of a villa but if we wanted to join everyone else we could go out and socalise in the main pool/bar area.

Thanks again, we will definately be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
672,MIXED REVIEW,40,April 2018,"My daughter and I booked a Haven room. On arrival at 12am we found the room very smelly, poorly maintained,dirty and the fridge did not work. The locks to both the balcony where hit and miss either they locked or didnt. After obtaining a new fridge as I had medication that needs to be kept cool and a repair to our locks it was 2am. To cut a long story short the following day after using the bathroom I became locked in there for over an hour. It was distressing and extremely hot. After my daughter returned to our room to find me and I was freed by maintenance I then for the first time ever complained about accomodation to management. With many thanks to Ryan we were moved to a beautiful ground floor suite at the other end of the hotel. The suite was spacious clean and beautiful. My only complaint would be the shower is over a very large bath and very difficult to get in and out of and quite slippery. The staff are polite and attentive and I enjoyed reading around the pool immensely. Breakfast was lovely with free latte and cappuccino. I will return here again but will alway book a suite or villa and highly advise anyone else booking here to do the same and spend that little extra.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
673,"Great location, comfortable resort",40,April 2018,"This hotel has a lovely vibe. Great location, good facilities, and presented nicely. The breakfast was the typical buffet and we had the option of the front or the garden location at the rear (and closer to our room). There is 2 pools but we only again used the rear one. The only downfall is at peak times the beds are nearly all doubles and there just isn't enough room for all the guests. But overall It was a great hotel and I would return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
674,Good value hotel,40,July 2017,Stayed her with my partner for 5 nights. Its not right in the heart of seminyak more towards legian end. Its on quite a busy street but the accomodation is set right back so you wont hear the road noise. The resort is huge and split into a hotel and private villa section. Bar / restaurant at the front great for people watching. Friendly staff decent food and close to all amenities. Good value... you get what you pay for!,The Haven Bali Seminyak

Thank you the reservation and Sales team which made my 18 days experience perfect. You are Da'Bomb!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
676,Great hotel for families,50,April 2018,"Stayed here for 7 nights in a 2 bedroom suite with three kids 20, 19 and 15. It was a great space for us all and the beds were very comfortable. Staff were very accommodating and friendly and the breakfast kept the hungry teens happy. The two pools were lovely but get in early for a sun lounge as they are occupied very early. Would definitely come back. Thank you The Haven for making our stay in Bali wonderful!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
677,Great location and nice pools but in need of renovation,30,February 2018,"Stayed at the Haven for 8 nights. We stayed in a two bedroom suite which was great, however a little tired and in need of renovation. The hotel itself was a little tired, but it had two great pools and breakfast was good. The staff were very lovely and always keen to please. One issue was that when I paid for a late checkout, my credit card details were written down on a piece of paper separate to my transaction record and when I challenged this, I was told it was for the hotel's records. I argued that the transaction was approved and there was a receipt existing and that I was concerned about the security of my card details. I further complained to the manager who kept telling me that it was ok and only for the hotel's records. I again stated that I thought it was extremely unsafe for me and poor practice for the hotel, but this fell on deaf ears. Another issue was that the door card key kept failing after the room was made up in the middle of the day. I was told to keep it away from my phone which I did, however I had to renew it most days to enter the room.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
678,"Atmosphere, ambiance and service",50,March 2018,"We came and dined at The Haven Restaurant several times and had we not prebooked alternative accommodation, we would have most definitely stayed here.

There was live music, Balinese culture, friendly staff, very efficient and great atmosphere in the heart of the main street in Seminyak.

The menu had a selection of western food as well as Indonesian and Balinese dishes. We found the western dishes to be reasonably priced in terms of portion size and taste. We also found the Indonesian food to be good, except the night we visited the Beef Rendang was extremely dry and different from the rendang I have eaten in other parts of Indonesia.

All round - great restaurant and hotel!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
679,Wonderful Food and Drinks,50,March 2018,"We were after a good place to dine with great food!! The Haven is brilliant! Food (I had baby Lobster. Husband house special and friends the steak) all really happy and contented with the food and the drink. A non drinker the mocktails were amazing. For something cool and refreshing Bali Tonic - I want the recipe !! And for sweet - Mother Teresa.
Highly recommended - First time Bali visitor - Aussie !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
680,1st trip to Bali,40,March 2018,"Awesome Our very 1st time in Bali & what an awesome resort this is for our very 1st stay & visit to Seminyak. Staff are so welcoming & willing to help you with anything. Close to shops, nice pools & the location is great with beach the a 10min walk away with amazing sun sets at night & supermarket/shops out on the main rd. Stayed in their suites & their huge, more then enough rm. Will definitely be coming back here in the near future.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
681,Last stop on our Bali experience.,40,March 2018,"So we’ve been in Bali for 2 weeks now. 1 week in Ubud, then here in Seminyak at the Haven Bali.

Generally a nice place. Closely located to shopping, the beach, markets and massage parlours out the front and back doors, not to mention the 3k trio across to Kuta and you have the big outlet stores and Waterbom park.

Pros: two good sized pools. Access to everything. Rooms was nicely presented, friendly staff, food ok too. Good wifi.

Cons: I booked this holiday 5 months in advance, and when It was check in time our superior upgraded room wasn’t ready. In fact, they didn’t have one available. So that was a less than average start. Getting a top sheet was a mission, had to ask three times over the course of a whole day, and when they did provide the sheet, it was a single and not a king... whoops!?!?!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
682,Bali family adventure,40,March 2018,Spent a week and loved ever minute. The rooms are great although had trouble getting in and out of the bath for a shower. The staff are very friendly always greeting you. The pools were great. The breakfasts were nice. The only thing I didn't like was they advertised a Seafood BBQ buffet but the only seafood was a fish casserole dish. Otherwise the meals were great.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
683,Very slippery,30,March 2018,"Just had 2 weeks at the Haven. Im a regular to Bali so I always eant to love love everywhere I stay. We got a 1 bedroom suite with extra bed. Pleased to stay somewhere with a living room seperate from bedroom to put the little one asleep. Yes there is some aging but our room was always cleaned well. We had an issue with the cream concrete near the pools and long pathway to the suites its very slippery and many people fall. Including our children. The staff were always friendly. The breakfasts were everything you can think of egg station and pancake/waffle station. We did have a mossie problem because of the gap under the sliding door so we tried jamming the blanket underneath in the evening and spraying. They fogg at 6:00pm. We had a voucher for dinner at the Sabeen resturant, so when we ate there we presented the voucher and told us we should of presented it beforehand as they give you a seperate menu. So we never got the complimentary meal and paid full price for our meal. I dont think its the havens fault but I was told from our agent there was kids activities around the pool but it was only colouring in. A kids club would be better suited to us.
I think the Suites are fab if you have teenagers and the Suites are good. But having little children slipping all the time and a balcony that a child can fall through just really scared me. The rack rooms above the main pool were kept awake from the loud pirate show and Tuesday traditional show. (We never went as it seemed pricey)The hotel kept us well informed on Nyepi and we choose to order lovely room service before the rush hour of dinner and had lovely food. (Room service reasonably priced) The pools are lovely well shaded but can be chilly in the morning and better off with a warmer afternoon swim. Also with Suites your better off exiting the back of the hotel as its a long walk to the front with lifts and strollers. Thankyou Haven we did have a lovely holiday and would recommend the Haven to people suited to the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
684,great service by all the staff,40,March 2018,"Staff, amenities, service, pools and restaurants were all fantastic. Room could be updated but beds were super comfy. Great location and close to beach shops and the hustle & bustle. Nyepi day was a very memorable experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
685,Highly Recommended to Stay,50,March 2018,"The Haven is located in the central of Seminyak. We stayed at Suite room and the cleanliness was good and staff very smiley and helpful Especially Mrs. Nita very helpful. The breakfast was excellent, there's nothing you cant find! Highly Recommended to stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
686,"Centrally Located, Close to the Beach and Nice Restaurants",50,March 2018,"Located in the heart of Seminyak, The Haven is a very nice place to stay. The pools, spa and restaurants inside are a very nice respite to the hotels surroundings. The rooms have ample space, are clean and comfortable. Nice beds as well. Private villas and suties are on the property as well with pools.

Leaving the hotel, the walk to the beach is a short distance. There is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the beach club that have chairs and umbrellas. However, it is not a far walk.

Walking right or left outside the hotel the street is crowded with cars, scooters, restaurants, and shopping. The hotel itself is buffered somehow from the street noise.

All staff are gracious and accommodating. Ernita and Dayu at reception went out of their way to ensure my comfort.

The pool area is terrific with ordering food poolside. Cushions and towels are provided . The Haven also has chairs, cushions and umbrellas on a deck overlooking the beach down the street which is provided free by the hotel.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner is provided at two of their restaurants, Sabeen and Lemon cello. Both reasonably priced and very good.

There is a spa on the premises as well which is a must !!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
687,BAD SERVICE.,10,March 2018,"The service is sucks. I spent Nyepi in The Haven Seminyak. Me and my friends booked 2 connecting rooms and already got the booking confirmation email from The Haven Seminyak, and when I checked in they said that the connecting room was full and we can get the connecting room that we booked. It’s so unprofessional. And on 17th March 2018 (Nyepi Day), they told us that we can order food until 22.00 but when I ordered room service at 21.53, the staff told me that I can’t. She said,”the last order is on 22.00 and now already 21.55. So the kitchen is close.” It’s ridiculous. So please The Haven Seminyak, if you want to close the kitchen on 22.00, please say that the last order is on 21.00 or 21.30. Thank you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
688,Great breakfast but....the room is dirty,20,March 2018,"The room definitely needs renovation. The bathroom glass door is out of alignment, the sliding door's handle is dirty, the toilet washing tube is disgusting with previous residue. The floor is cracking, stain on the sink, molds on the floor as well. Water stain is visible on the wall.

Other than the unsatisfied room we had, the hotel's location, breakfast and pool are great. Welcome drink is refreshing!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
689,"Great stay, family friendly",40,March 2018,"It’s taken me a while to write this review because I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Haven Suites, however the rooms are looking a bit run down and so are some of the amenities. Not quite sure how old this hotel is and with the humidity things don’t stay new for long.

We had a two bedroom suite which was perfect for our family of four and included a living room and kitchen. It was clean, tidy and well appropriated so no complaints there. Bathrooms were a little tired and had some stains, same with other parts of the rooms. Pool area for the suites was fabulous and the kids had a ball! Can be a bit of a walk from the Suites to the Hotel but the Suites does have its own lobby, cafe and pool so no need to walk if you don’t want too.

Great location and very family friendly, lots of families with small children were staying at the same time as us in the Suites so never felt like we were bothering other guest. The Hotel is more for cool, young travellers or people staying without kids.

Would stay again! Thanks Haven!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
690,Good location in Seminyak,40,March 2018,"Location was great for our 4D3N stay in Seminyak. Located on a busy street with lots of food, shopping and spa/massage options! 10-15minute walk to the beach too, which was convenient. Rooms are clean and neat, good value for the price. Suites are further in and are a lot bigger and nicer, they also have their own pool in the back area of the hotel. Loved the breakfast spread every morning, lots of options to choose from. Laundry service was good, my husband got his wedding suit dry cleaned for only ~$13-15AUD!! (they had a 30% discount offer at that time). Staff could be a bit more competent and flexible with some of our requests. They sent our honeymoon cake to one of our friends room instead of our room, but couldn't offer to give us another cake despite their mistake. When asked about the possibility of an upgrade since it was our post wedding trip (even enquired about the cost to upgrade), the staff made it seem like it was a tough request, and didn't know what to do. But then another one of our friends who also checked in right next to us easily got an upgrade to the suite without even requesting for it! Not sure how their system works. Anyway, we would come back to stay, because the location is ideal. Interested to stay in one of their villas next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
691,Want to love it....but.....,30,March 2018,"We stayed for a week. We arrived at 11pm. We booked a hotel room and arrived to find the door to patio broken and unable to be locked, the safe not working and mouldy pillows. No offer to move rooms was offered. Upgrade option was given upon request but for $75AUD a night. The next day we finally found someone to help us in Miss Ayu who knew we were struggling and offered us an upgrade to a suite for $40AUD a night. We were so relieved to find someone that understood us and wanted to help. This was much better. Clean, spacious, everything in working order. Service was always pleasant, but at times on the slow side. A suggestion would be to have staff, or more staff, poolside. Food was always lovely. A precaution though.....please take care in the hallways when it rains. The tiles become very very slippery. I slipped and fell (even though I was being careful), and hurt my shoulder, which was a shame.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
692,Haven Bali-Seminyak,40,March 2018,"Haven Bali, is a Good hotel and centrally situated.
Suites are clean and adequate space. Friendly staff and efficient.

Breakfast menu can improve though, lunch and dinner have nice specials

Suggestion to have covered area to walk back to Suites/Villas when it rains.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
693,Great Location. Great Hotel.,40,March 2018,"Just spent 1 week at The Haven in March 2018.
I have seen this hotel on several occasions on previous visits to Bali but had only ever visited the restaurant.
My stay here was lovely and very pleasant.
On arrival I was pleasantly greeted and from that moment on, every single staff member I encountered always had a smile and a greeting.
The hotel is divided into 3 parts that all flow together.
The front section is the hotel, followed by the vilas and then the suites at back of complex.
I stayed on second floor of hotel overlooking the pool. My room was spacious and very clean. Only downside was that the lighting in bathroom was a bit dim, but the rest of the room lived up to expectations.
The pool is lovely and very refreshing. The breakfast was good with many selections available. The lunch and dinner menu were also very good. Had the opportunity to dine there a couple of times.
Housekeeping were prompt and on point. The hotel is in a great location. I had hired a scooter for the week like I do on most trips to Bali. I found that I didn’t use it as much this trip as there was so much within walking distance to the hotel.
My only complaint I had was with the telephone in the room.
On a daily basis it rang at all hours of the day with someone looking for someone that wasn’t clearly In my room. I was called on 3 occasions reminding me that my checkout time had arrived and I needed to check out. There seemed to be mixed phone lines somewhere and a miscommunication with bookings.
During my stay I did notice a small amount of staff with trainee badges on, so I am not going to crucify anyone over the phone calls. It was a little annoying but didn’t affect my stay at all. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and highly recommend it and would return myself.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
694,"An Oasis, Friendly Staff and Great Loaction",40,February 2018,"Was celebrating a milestone birthday in Bali in Feb, and a group of 20 of us stayed at The Haven in Feb 2018. First time for all of us. Was an amazing hotel. Rooms were beautiful and spacious. Some friends booked one bedroom, others a 1 bedroom suite and we stayed in a 1 bedroom Villa. Villa has very beautiful. Heaps of room, a private pool and generally a place to relax. There's two Pools - both were are peaceful spots to relax. Staff are so friendly and always greet you no matter what time it is. For my birthday, they gave me a surprise cake and staff sang happy birthday to me by the pool. The Haven's location is a great spot in Seminyak. Walking distance to shops, restaurants and the beach. The breakfasts are fantastic and a great mix of Western and Indonesia food. We had a fantastic holiday and The Haven played a memorable part of it. Will definitely be staying again. Thanks.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
695,Beautiful food,50,March 2018,We’ve been for a meal twice now and it’s one of the nicest meals we’ve had so far. Their satay is amazing. It’s prices are mid range. I liked having a beer and watching the world go by there. The staff are extremely helpful too.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
696,Clean hotel & great value,40,March 2018,"Arrived on Sunday Feb 25 from Melbourne.
This was the second time I have stayed @ The Haven.
The staff are all so friendly, easy to check in & check out.
The room was very clean & suited my needs.
Rooms are serviced daily.
I started most mornings with a walk, return to have breakfast which was included in the nightly cost & then sit by the pool reading & having a swim for most of the morning.
Great spot, lots to offer, family friendly, little or no noise most nights & very central in Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
697,Busy hotel in a great location,40,March 2018,"We have stayed at the Haven before in a cheap and cheerful room, however this time was a little different with our young son. We ended up going for a little more room in the suites / villas and it suited us perfectly. The hotel ensured his sleeping arrangements were provided, and the extra space helped us relax a lot more.
The hotel facilities are of a reasonable standard, and the spa has some great packages available.
The meals are reasonable, however due to the location of the hotel, there are plenty of choices nearby (beach is approx. 15 min walk)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
698,VALUE VALUE VALUE,50,October 2017,"Great place, right in the heart of Seminyak. Breakfast is great and if you grab a ""front stalls"" seat you get to enjoy Bali getting up for the morning. We had a basic room but still got a king bed and decent bathroom. If you want to go bigger or fancier, the suites are great and the Villas are stunning.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
699,Great location close to everything is going,50,March 2018,We stayed overnight before heading off to the Gili islands. We wanted somewhere central with nice rooms pool and good breakfast. This place ticked all the boxes. Staff are excellent and they quicklly check you in. We were upgraded to a suite which was beautiful and spacious. Pool is a good size and the buffet breakfast was very good with both Asian and American breakfast options. Will stay here again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
700,Reasonable property a little tired.,30,February 2018,"Location is fine for shopping, restaurants etc., hotel is a little tired but they are actively doing maintenance constantly, all staff are very friendly and obliging, breakfast was included in our price, we had 4 girls in a 2 bedroom suite - layout was great but again a little tired and dated. Overall you get what you pay for.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
701,Great room and friendly staff,50,March 2018,"Have had fantastic food, service, massage since arriving. All the staff are polite, super friendly and helpful. The pool is big and beautiful and stays cool all day. The day spa was amazing. Our room was spacious and clean and nice to relax in the air con when the days are hot. The shuttle bus to the beach and back is also great and the beach club relaxing and comfortable. Breakfasts are amazing and even with a wheat allergy there were plenty of options. Would stay here again for sure. Our kids would love this place.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
702,Large suites,40,March 2018,We spent a week here central to everything. Beautiful tranquillity around the pools a peaceful location. 2 bedroom suite was huge and lovely. The towels need updating and the bathroom cleans need to be a little better but other then that it was a fabulous experience and our children enjoyed the activities offered around the pool great touch! Cocktails were great and at a fabulous price🍹,The Haven Bali Seminyak
703,Great hotel at this price!!,50,February 2018,It's a great hotel with very courteous staff. Location of this hotel is very convenient and staff is always willing to accommodate all your requests. We requested for vegetarian food in breakfast and they tried to help us. It's a must hotel to be considered for stay in Seminyak.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
704,"good facilities, same as the advertisement in the web site",40,February 2018,"yes location also good for shopping, eating, very easy, hotel facilities are good, beverage also has one free pool drink everyday as special deal, gym and swimming pool are clean, fit to me as a gym instructor.
Also need to say thanks to the receptionist Miss Desi, she is good, she point out very clear where we can enjoy the facilities in the hotel, due to the hotel is quite big, need time to explore, alos we are in special package, so she will help you to print out all your vouchers to enjoy all these benefit, such as dinner, lunch, message vouchers, otherwise you will disappoint.
Finally thanks receptionist Miss Desi, I am very appreciated for her service.

705,The staff were absolutely wonderful with good food and great views. Thank you Haven!,50,February 2018,"What an amazing experience. Staff were absolutely wonderful providing good service and great manners. Made a few friends along the way. Sping, Ayu and Shelfie are among the many friendly staff at the Haven. Worth the price!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
706,Love staying at The Haven,40,February 2018,"This is our third stay at The Haven. I find all the staff very friendly and willing to help with anything you need. We had some problems with the air conditioning but the staff made it their priority to attempt to fix it. Whilst the issue wasn't fixed as i think the air con's are quite old, they did provide a large pedestal fan which was great. The air con is ok, just not icy cold which, at the end of a day walking and shopping, there is nothing better than walking into your icy cold room but like i said, not too bad overall.

The beds are like sleeping on a cloud! I have the best sleep on these huge beds.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, the cooking facility was handy as we traveled with a food fussy toddler. I could quickly cook her something to eat each night and it was easier than ordering 3 different meals from a restaurant hoping she'd eat it. The large fridge was also great to store her snacks and our drinks and food.
The Bingtang supermarket is only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel too and this place has everything you need to stock up for your holiday.
The rooms were very clean although the bathrooms could use new shower heads and better lighting as there is no way to get natural light if you need to put on make-up (small problem but i did wear make-up one night as it was my birthday and we went to a nice restaurant).
The section of the hotel in the middle i think is the best place to stay, it is so quiet. The front near the reception area is slightly noisier but only noticeable if they have a band playing or special buffet dinner night.
We also love the pool, it's in a shady spot which was good for us so we weren't in the beaming sun.
The location of the hotel is perfect, so close to everything and only a few minutes walk to the beach via the back way of the hotel.
You have so much choice with this hotel. Stay in a room, suite or villa all in the one location. We were lucky enough to be shown through a 2 bedroom villa and wow wow wow, this will be the next one we stay in.
Thanks for a great stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
707,Decent place,30,February 2018,"We stayed 3 nights

First of all our room was not the one that was advertised to us and was provided a room with a bad view and it was just above the sabeen restaurant so it was quite noisy and could hear all the people and the phone ringing for room service.

The room was very run down with cracks on the floor tiles/ rusty overhead shower head (which we did not use as it was way too rusty, used handheld) and splits in the walls.

We ordered room service and opted to pay as you go and not use a credit card and when we tried to pay the staff member and I was counting the money (including coins)
the staff took my other pile of money and said ""this will do""
now in my opinion a staff member should not be touching customers money especially when I was already counting the money I had ready for the service,
I had to argue with the staff member telling him that this is the money I will pay.

Pool is great and the staff members in general are quite attentive but most staff members only know their scripted lines but their managers are well capable of handling english.

The buffet breakfast available at the sabeen restaurant is average but they do change their menu everyday, so something new everyday.

Local amenities and location is great and close to everything by either walk or vehicle.

Overall the visit to the haven was pleasing for our first 3 nights in bali and can recommend the place if you're just going to stay for the night or just use the place as a hub as it is very accessible and most taxi drivers know the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
708,Would stay again,50,February 2018,"There were a few complications on check in with the time we could get into the room but the staff were more than understanding and gave us a welcome drink etc. The rooms were lovely and clean with a view of the pool. There was room service available with a restaurant as well. Our booking included breakfast which was a buffet and DELICIOUS. We went to the 'Atma' spa multiple times and we're always happy. There is free wifi, a lovely pool, gym etc. Would stay again. Close to shops and restaurants and only a 50,000 IDR ($5 AUS) cap ride into Kuta.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
709,Wow Wow Wow,50,January 2018,"After just returning home from ""The Haven, all as we can say is Wow. We loved every minute of our 14 day stay in our one bedroom Villa. ""The Haven is in a great location, facilities are very good, staff very attentive and always willing to help with a smile. Thanks to everyone you made our stay one of the best holidays my husband and I have ever experienced in Bali. A big thankyou goes to our Butlers, Suardiana, Made Suastawan and Marcel for making our stay comfortable, carefree and relaxing. Riyani for greeting us every morning for breakfast, to start our day on a positive note. Ayu at reception for organising our next two stays in September 2018 and March 2019,at The Haven. We honestly can't wait.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
710,nothing special,20,February 2018,"As we arrived in the hotel,the front desk didn't understand about our booking.We want to extend our stay for 5 days as we already booked for 2 days and we emailed the hotel that we reserved another 5 days because we are worried about the volcano..She keep on telling us that the rate is the rate on that day we arrived.We explained to her that the rate should he the rate when we booked in for 2 days.Again she didn't listened.So we showed her the replied email and she understand us.
The buffet breakfast wasnt bad.The room need to be fix or renovate especially the shower looks old.I found out old blood stain on the mattress protector and sheets..I think it's not 4 star hotel.It's noisy,we were in the 2nd floor.Still can hear the noise outside they have undergoing maintenance.We stayed 7 days.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.Hotel taxi are not honest.They charged double.Better get taxi outside.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
711,Great,50,January 2018,"We took the suites room with two bedroom. It's very nice room, complete with kitchen set. The breakfast was great with variety foods. The staff was very polite and friendly. But If you're looking for a quiet hideaway this is not it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
712,Exceeded expectations,40,February 2018,"This was my second visit to the hotel and my first review. While the hotel is not on the beach it is in a great location for shopping and restaurants. I was in a double room and was impressed with the size and that all rooms have a balcony. My room overlooked one of the 3 pools. The shower pressure was fabulous, the staff always accommodating, and the included buffet breakfast ample. It is a modern-ish hotel so does not have the traditional Bali ambience, but for a good priced hotel, it would be hard to beat for value for money",The Haven Bali Seminyak
713,Busy Location,30,February 2018,The Haven was in a very busy location. The sound of traffic and whistles could be heard from my room. I booked 5 months in advance and was disappointed when I was not offered a ground floor room near the pool as I requested when making the booking. Restaurant quality was good with reasonable rates. Too busy for me personally,The Haven Bali Seminyak
714,Nice place to stay,30,January 2018,"On arrival from a 16 hour flight to the haven at 11.30pm we were told we they didn’t have our room ready (I booked this in October) & that they could only offer me & my partner a twin room, this was really disappointing but they said there was no other option. In my experience if a hotel cannot deliver they should upgrade you, not downgrade. There was no remorse and when I said to the reception so is that it that’s all you can do he laughed and said yes. Anyway the next day we were told we could move to another double room... 5pm this still was not ready and we were sitting around waiting for our room and our suitcases. Now that is unacceptable.

I didn’t eat at the hotel due to a lady telling me in the pool that 4 family’s had been ill during her stay from the breakfast buffet.

There are toiletries in the room & a bottle of water is left each day which is a nice touch. This was handy to clean your teeth with to avoid any Bali belly.

If you are a sun worshipper this probably isn’t the hotel for you as the pool is very shady with only the bottom end getting the sunshine for a while in the day.

Overall the hotel and its surroundings are nice it’s very tranquil as you walk around. It’s close to shops, bars, cafes. Bluebird taxis are always available outside too.
The organisation of our room just really disappointed me to start off our holiday in that way.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
715,Perfect in so many ways,50,February 2018,"My first time to Bali and I was so lucky to have stayed at the Haven. Great rooms, beds and pillows. Fantastic staff. Perfect location. Will definitely be back. Missing the fabulous breakfasts already.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Breakfast was ok too . Only complaint would be the smell of damp in the lifts . Staff very friendly",The Haven Bali Seminyak
718,great location,40,February 2018,This hotel is clean and friendly the food is fresh the prices are fairly average if you eat here however to the left and right of the hotel are many good quality restaurants at really cheap prices it is in the middle of a busy shopping area where you can buy imitation brands of everything there is a supermarket about 100 meters away the tours Etc that are on offer seem to be as street prices the swimming pool is large and semi shaded.

720,Relaxing and chilled!,50,December 2017,"I stayed at this hotel for the first time in December and have already re-booked another stay there.
I was lucky enough to be upgraded for the first night of my stay to a one-bedroom suite and it was simply beautiful. The room was 90 square meters in size and contained a seating area, kitchenette, dining area, HUGE balcony, large bedroom and massive bathroom. It absolutely exceeded my expectations.
When I was moved back to the main hotel, the room was still clean, a decent size and had all the things one needs to make a hotel stay enjoyable!",The Haven Bali Seminyak

722,"Home away from home, The Haven Seminyak for a first time Bali tourist",50,January 2018,"The hotel was centrally located - surrounded by restaurants, spas & massages, shops and proximity to the beach. It had all the basic amenities you need ranging from swimming pool, gym to restaurants.The hotel did not have fanciful lobby but was clean, the hotel rooms were spacious & most importantly a sense of security. The daily hotel buffet breakfast was a must to start the day & it served both western & Asian foods. The chef also rotated a small selection of the dishes too. If you wantex a light lunch or a light meal, the à la carte items on the menu was worth trying. However, the two buffet dinners I had in the restaurant were nothing to brag about.

What really impressed me throughout my stay was the courtesy shown by all the hotel staff, from reception to wait staff, house keeping to bellboy. They always provided the service with smiles on their faces.

I had a very pleasant 6 days stay at the hotel. We will be back again soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
723,What a surprise!,50,January 2018,"Just returned from staying at The Haven, Seminyak, Bali, and it was the best experience, having in the past stayed at hotels more than twice the price.
Don't book a room, but book a suite for $100AUD per night including breakfast.
Our suite had a full kitchen, dining room and lounge room, (all in one, but huge!). Our bedroom was HUGE with bath, shower ensuite. We had two balconies overlooking three pools, and on each balcony were double sized day-beds.
Yes, breakfast was a tiny bit more basic than the five-star hotels, but it had everything you wanted and was delicious. Staff were only too happy to get anything else you wanted and they delivered.
Being more intimate at breakfast everyone talked to each other and told about their best finds, like restaurants and shopping, in the area. We made some great savings because of that.
Staff were personal, attentive, happy and friendly.
If you wanted to go to the beach, (a five-minute walk), there was a shuttle bus every two hours.
We thoroughly recommend this hotel!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
724,Huge Suites,40,January 2018,"Loved the 2nd time here and love the suites excellent location and even though it’s older and could do with some freshening up but still clean,the staff are all fabulous and especially want to thank Erna for giving us a late checkout at no extra charge.
Will definitely recommend this hotel for a group of 4 or 5 in the 2bdrm suites, the pool down the back is beautiful surrounded by vegetation and is quiet.
Thank you very much

725,Two Bedroomed Villa - just heavenly,50,January 2018,We have just returned from an 8 day stay at the The Haven. We had booked a 2 bedroomed suite but decided to upgrade to a two bedroomed villa with private pool. We had our own butler service and Marcel was excellent nothing was too much trouble. Irna from reception was very helpful and again nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was very good with dedicated egg station and waffle/pancake station. Always a good selection of food available plus proper cappuccino/lattes made to order at no extra cost. Hotel is in an excellent location at the top of Double 6 - 5 minute walk to the beach and a 3 minute walk to the Bintang Supermarket. The Atma spa at the hotel was very good with very reasonable prices for an in house Spa.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
726,Great breakfast,40,May 2017,Stayed here many times. Right on the busy street and double six. Staff very helpful. Got upgraded once but last time we stayed room showed its age. Rough around the edges. Hotel always busy so no option of a room change. Amazing varied and delightful breakfast!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
727,Nice spacious hotel & friendly staffs.,50,January 2018,"Nice experiences with friends during my stay in this hotel. I enjoyed my stay here. The atmosphere nice & all the staffs were helpful. The front desk staffs welcomed us warmly when we checked in. It was nice suite room that we had. The room had a kitchen to make our own food. The space were clean and cozy. I really liked to have my time in the middle of shady trees near the pool. Reading some books there and it was a like home feeling that i had in this hotel. The hotel was in a great location for easy access to market and shopping center in Seminyak. Many good restaurants & cafe to chill out, shops to buy merchandise, drug store, mini marts nearby that made us easier to get something that we needed. The food they served from the room service was also great. Nice pizza and happy hour for the drinks from the restaurant. Another nice thing was its free shuttle to the beach. This hotel had a beach club near the beach which wasn't really far from the hotel. Shuttle to their beach club was provided to bring you there. And if you walk, it would only take you 10 minutes to go there. I will certainly come back later on my next trip to Bali with all my friends.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
728,Great hotel in the vicinity of Legian,50,February 2017,"It's good for you who seek quality of sleep without going too far from the center of ""noise"" of the famous Legian Kuta. Stayed in a deluxe room. It's spacious and clean. Breakfast was good as well as the room service. Sure I'd be back again to this hotel when visiting Bali next time",The Haven Bali Seminyak
729,Spacious suite rooms,50,February 2017,"We plan to return to this hotel on June 2018, but We still confuse whether the cleanliness and the property of this hotel is well maintained or not. We (2 adults with 2kids under 7years) ever stayed at the haven suite from 30Dec15-3Jan16 (4 nights).
At that time this property considered as brand new hotel in seminyak, what we still remember are:
1. Top value of money.
2. The one bedroom suite was spacious, extremely exceed our expectation and the cleanliness of the room were considered meet 4stars standard.
2. the breakfast was delicious, we very loved the crispy bacon.
3. the location has two access which are Seminyak street and double six.

Tips: If you rent a car, better park at seminyak side to avoid traffic to go in/out to/from the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
730,Best breakfast,50,February 2017,"This hotel is beautiful! Lovely staff, delicious food and amazing location. The hotel is in the middle of 66 which is the main street filled with market stalls, cafes and massage shops. There are two entry points for the Haven, which is a bonus because you can use this as a short cut! The breakfast is so yummy!! A wide variety which is excellent for families of all ages. The rooms are clean and tidy, they have everything you need! Will be returning to The Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak
731,Narurally the Haven,50,January 2018,"I returned to The Haven after two years
The very large and comfortable rooms are equipped with everything, moreover, slippers, bathrobes, and complimentary water.
But what makes the difference to the extreme cleanliness of both the rooms and the common areas, is the friendliness and kindness of the staff.
I mention some in particular
the supervisor: Murtini
Her room attendant: Galung, Juliarta, Wigaya.
At the reception
Miss Erna, Ayu, Nova, Ernita, Dayu
The chief room manager Mr. Sugita, a very kindley, human and professional person thanks to him if the staff has an extra gear.
Sure I will return to The Haven Suites hotel because is the really the Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak
732,Amazing Holiday,50,January 2018,The Haven is real Heaven. Great location and friendly staff especially at Front Office..The Receptionist deliver excellent service upon my arrival. The room is always clean and fresh..The breakfast is plenty of choices..Definitely will come back again !!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
733,Long Weekend Away,40,January 2018,"Me and my fiancee checked in Wednesday and stayed until Sunday. Lovely location, great walking distance to all main shops, beach, massage places, restaurants/bars. Amazing choice of buffet breakfast every morning. Lovely lovely staff, they were so helpful and kind and would do anything they could to make our stay pleasant. Can't complain about the hotel! Relaxing pool with beds and grass area to sunbathe and order cocktails. They do charge 20% on top of food and drinks which does make it abit pricey but other than that, everything was great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
734,Fantastic place,50,January 2018,"We stayed as a family of four in a two room apartment. A big lounge room with two big bedrooms, one coming off each side of the lounge room

Each room with their own bathroom

A TV in each room, one in the lounge room. Comfortable couch, I would put a second couch instead of the two air chairs but no big deal

We paid about $200 AUD per night with breakfast included

The resort itself has two great pools although I would say they could do with being a couple of degrees warmer, that would be my only small criticism

The resort is within walking distance to some great restaurants and massage places

Staff were friendly and responsive to any requests

All in all a very comfortable and enjoyable holiday",The Haven Bali Seminyak
735,Lunch,20,January 2018,We had lunch at the PoolBar today and was very disappointed. I thought the avocado chicken was a burger but it was a few strips of chicken in bread. And the Seminyak Double was just double bread! Not worth the extra 21% tax they add on top of the already high price for what you get. We thought the area was cool but not worth the price. Walk on.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
736,Great experience and location,50,November 2017,We had a great experience here during our visit to Seminyak. Excellent breakfast buffet and very friendly/helpful staff. Our room was situated towards the back of the resort so it was very quiet and pleasant. Reasonably priced :),The Haven Bali Seminyak
737,"Great experience, lovely staff",40,December 2017,"Our room was very nice - very large, super comfortable bed, great shower. It was slightly musty when we went in but a quick airing soon sorted that. The pool areas are nice, but very cold first thing! There are towels that get handed out beside the pool and mine was still warm so that was nice to get out to! While the hotel is on a very busy road you cannot hear it when you get into the hotel properly or in your rooms. The staff were all exceptionally nice and service was great.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
738,Overall a great experience,40,January 2018,"We stayed in two separate types of rooms, needing two bedroom accomodation. At first we stayed in two separate rooms with a connecting door and loved it. It was on the fourth floor of the main building and was fresh, modern, clean and a delight. We had already booked a family villa for two nights but arrived early. When we enquired about staying in our first two rooms, we were told that this was an upgrade and much larger, which was true, but in many ways we felt this apartment was older and more tired than the first two rooms we had. However, the apartment was at the back of the hotel with nice surroundings, definitely quieter and had a day bed on the deck outside it. The pools are modern, but the water was so cold two of us refused to swim at all. The food at their restaurant was very good. And a great location and wonderful service by staff. They couldn't do enough for us, even stopping the traffic on the busy road outside for hotel guests and cars to get across easily. Overall, we all enjoyed this resort.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
739,Villa,40,June 2017,"The villa , 2 bedroom at the Haven was wonderful . Clean. Luxurious. We had a great stay . Only drawback is walking to beach . You can take the hotel shuttle there . The breakfast is amazing .We had stayed before in a normal room . That was great too . Staff efficient and friendly .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
740,Best of Both Worlds,50,January 2018,"Loved our stay at The Haven. As a friend booked it, I was a bit concerned about the proximity to the road. However was pleasantly surprised when we were escorted to the back of the hotel with a lovely peaceful pool area snd quiet location. We had a one bedroom suite which was a great size. The breakfast was good and don't have to pay extra for lattes, which seems to be common at most hotels. Loved that we could always book a massage on the day and enjoyed the food at the Sabeen restaurant. Next time I come with my husband I will book here - he'll love the bar and people watching and I'll love the relaxing and quiet pool area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
741,Excellent venue for business meetings!,50,January 2018,"Excellent business meeting rooms, highly recommended venue for business meetings in Bali! Rooms are decent with very accommodating hotel staff.

Special thanks to Ernita for the awesome business arrangements and amazing hospitality.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
742,Excellent Staff and Excellent Location!,50,January 2018,Great location with very accommodating staff. I ordinarily stay in Legian/Kuta but this time ventured out and loved Seminyak. It is about 300m away from Bintang Supermarket. The breakfast is great. I stayed in a suite and found it a fantastic size. I would definitely stay here again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
743,Not a Four Star Hotel!,20,January 2018,"Where do I start.
Upon arrival, having booked 3 rooms in September, we had to wait nearly half an hour while the worked out how to accommodate 5 adults in rooms with a”big bed”.
Sadly, although nearly everyone in Bali wants to help and tries very hard, the reception and restaurant staff don’t speak enough English for their roles. Service in the restaurant was non-existent, with about 2or 3 trainees for each supervising “experienced” staff member.
Rooms near the pool are very noisy.
On the positive side, while the food in the restaurant was mediocre, breakfast was very good, with a wide choice of food and juices.
The rooms were clean and nicely presented, without being special.
The location is good with many nice restaurants within walking distance.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
744,Cozy Place to Stay,50,January 2018,"It was nice and enjoy experience in this hotel. The staff are really friendly and helpful. We had requested botol opener for our champagne in the evening, in couple minutes they bring it to our room. They understood what we order. The room are cozy with huge balcony overlooking pool. The breakfast also nice. Definitely will come back and recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
745,"“It was a good stay overall. Few staffs need to be more polite , other staffs were all awesome :)”",30,January 2018,"Liked the location of the Hotel. Walking distance to Double Six Beach. The hotel looked good from outside. Our room was ready when we reached and it was decorated as asked with a welcome card. Two Swimming Pools and two entries for the hotel. The bed was comfortable and the room service was great. We ordered a pizza at 1:00 am in night and got it in 20 mins.Even the flea market was 3 mins from the hotel in a bike or car. The room was clean but the bathroom was a little stinking. May be because the building we stayed was pretty old. There are two buildings for this hotel - One the front side and the other the back side. I think the back side is the older building and that's why cracks on the floor of room. Most of the staffs were very helpful and careful for the comfort of the customers.

Bathroom cleanliness, breakfast could have been much better and tastier, no option for vegetarians - I survived on fruits and bread butter all the three days. Tried veg mie goreng and it was too salty. Some of the staffs were really good , but few of them were rude and did not respond when asked to clean the table and chair for the breakfast. The breakfast time was from 7:30 to 10:30 am , but by 9:00 am only most of the stuffs would get over. I think they should manage that. The lady at the front side reception was a little rude - was staring us when we requested for a room at a higher floor , as I had requested that already while booking. She could have just smiled and responded properly. Her name was Ayu or something. Also the room lights were very dim , at least a light above the reading table and mirror would have helped.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
746,Average rooms / Good service / Beautiful spa facilities,30,January 2018,"My husband and I stayed at The Haven for six nights - didn't expect the hotel to be right in the centre of Seminyak. We arrived at the hotel after five days in Gili Air so we were expecting the hotel to be a nice quiet area near the beach however I was kind of disappointed when we drove to the front of the hotel and discovered that it was right in the middle of busy Seminyak.
Rooms are average - it got quiet noisy at times as our room was on the top floor and overlooked the pool - they had a live band set up for three nights during our stay and all we could hear until 10 / 10.30 pm was the band - no biggie - but would have preferred the music to settle down by at least 9.30 pm.
Service was OK - Buffet Breakfast is OK - the only thing that annoyed us about the breakfast was that when it came to ordering latte's in the morning we would ask for strong latte's and we were always given coffee that tasted like warmed up milk. Food in general is over priced - we would always go out and eat.
Spa is beautiful - I got a massage - very relaxing and the staff were very friendly.

If I were to stay here again I would only stay for two nights max - I would try to find somewhere that's close to the beach and away from all the hustle and bustle.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
747,Partners Birthday / Holiday,20,January 2018,"A little disappointed. I booked this hotel based on the good reviews and went by the pictures that are shown on their website. And also the “ central Seminyak” location which it is not, it’s a good 20minute taxi ride to Seminyak square where all the nice shops and restaurants are. Anyway, We thought we had booked a 1 bedroom suite ( mentioned on my booking it was my partners birthday trip away, which it was! ) we arrived at the hotel and it took about 20 minutes to check in as there was one boy working on reception trying to do 10 different jobs at once. We got to our room and it was a ‘hotel’ room with a balcony view of another building, the coffee cups & kettle in the room were yellow, we asked to be upgraded and mentioned how disappointed we were especially with the fact it was my partners birthday and we’d paid almost $700 for this room! They changed rooms the following day, to the exact same room with a half decent view of the pool. A little better but not great. The telephone in the room smelt rotten!

One day our room still hadn’t been cleaned by 4pm , after leaving our room for the 3rd time when housekeeping finally came we went down stairs to the restaurant for a coffee whilst we waited and got charged $15!

Other than that. The Spa is the best part about the hotel I had 2 massages and a facial and they were both amazing.
Staff very friendly, good choice of food for breakfast although we got very bored of it after a few days as it’s the same food every day.
Shuttle bus down to the ‘ private beach ‘ is handy, no drinks or food provided by the hotel though.

I never usually write reviews or complain but we felt very let down by this and felt the need to share!

If you stay in this hotel I’d suggest you make sure your in the suite section or a villa as the hotel rooms are very basic for the price you pay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
748,Very nice Hotel and good services,50,December 2017,"It's the first time to my families to visit Bali together..from Dec 26, 2017 to 30 Dec 2017. So we took the suites room with two bedroom..it's very nice room, complete with kitchen set, big refrigerator, induction stove, and with poolside balcony..so I can see my kids directly from my room while they enjoyed the swimming time. The breakfast was great..very delicious and many variety foods. The inconvenience about this hotel is distance from the lobby to our suites room is quite far..so when it's raining it's a little bit annoying..and the second day the key card won't open the door..so we have to wait the replacement key card from the front desk. The staff was very polite and friendly..special thanks for Mrs. Ni Komang Ayu Sukerti..which helps us to find and delivered our Painting..which left in our room when we checked out from the hotel. Thanks very much..keep up the good jobs..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
749,Too Noisy,30,December 2017,"I guess this hotel is ideally located right in the middle of Seminyak but for a Solo traveller it was way too noisy. The room was tidy and neat. The service was very good. however, the rooms all face the swimming pool areas. The restaurant/bar open out onto the pool area. They happened to have a band on until midnight. If you're looking for a quiet hideaway this is not it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
750,"I was not a hotel guest, only had terrible restaurant experience -",10,January 2018,"We went to the restaurant about 8.00pm as the group of 7 + infant. There were only 5-7 tables occupied including one big table with group of 10 guys. We were placed in the part of the room without any air movement (ventilators are located only in the part in the front of the room) so we had to ask for mobile ventilator (which finally was provided). We were even informed at the beginning, that our food may take some time to prepare, it took them about 90 minutes to provide. Their service was not synchronized at all, so last group member was still waiting, when first already finished (to be absolutely clear, we haven't ordered any starters, soups, main courses only. And all of that was fairly expensive comparing to Seminyak standards. By the way (there I have no clear evidence of causal link) two of us were sick the night after.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
751,"Good, with some reservations",30,December 2017,"This will probably be the longest hotel review I have ever written, as I’m in two minds about this hotel.
Firstly, many of the reviews say “central Seminyak”. Be aware it is actually on the southern edge of Seminyak, across Double-six street from Legian, and a long way (a taxi ride) from Seminyak Square and the chic shops there.
Secondly, the hotel is really two places - the hotel/restaurant/bar/reception on the main street, and the suites in separate buildings down towards the back of the long, thin property. The first picture on the website shows the pool/garden area of the suites - the hotel pool is quite different. This review is of a stay in a two-bedroom suite. The hotel area has a very different atmosphere - much more “urban”.

First the pros (and there are a lot).
1/ The two bedroom suites are large, comfortable and well-equipped, perfect for a family or even two couples.
2/ The garden and pool areas are lovely. Very pretty and well-maintained. The pool area is quite shady (I liked that) but not ideal if you want to spend your days getting a tan. We saw the pool being cleaned multiple times we were there.
3/ The buffet breakfast was really good, with Asian and western selections, plus separate egg and waffle/pancake stations. The breakfast area of the suites was a lovely setting near the pool.
4/ Leaving the back entrance of the suites it is a short walk down Double-Six Street to the beach
5/ The staff were very friendly & gracious
6/ WiFi in the rooms and public areas worked well
7/ The suites end of the property is very quiet and peaceful, both around the pool and in the rooms.
8/ The hotel has a “beach club” - a few sun lounges on a roped off section at the back of the beach. No drinks service, but you can buy food and drinks from the bar next door and they’ll deliver to you.
9/ Double-Six Street has lots of dining options.

Now the cons.
1/ On arrival we had a ground floor suite (0909/0908). Of the three air conditioners (one in each bedroom and one in the lounge/dining), one didn’t produce any cold air and one gave out a horrible damp, musty smell. Looking at the location of the outdoor units in a sort of damp space between two buildings I don’t believe they could ever work properly. When we first complained someone came and sprayed air freshener, but after two nights we insisted on a room change. The new rooms were much better (third floor).
2/ Our initial rooms were noisy - probably due to the location of the outside aircon units
3/ We had problems with the key card - the unit controlling the lights was replaced promptly, but the bell-boy who brought our bags had the same problem so it should have been reported and replaced straight away rather than when we had issues later on.
4/ Soon after checking in, and after leaving a credit card deposit, someone came and removed all the mini-bar drinks from the main fridge, and locked the mini bar in the second bedroom. We never really found out why.
5/ Our initial rooms only had lukewarm water
6/ Our initial rooms had a warped internal door that stuck slightly - probably due to the damp. Only an issue if someone was sleeping and you entered the bedroom as it was noisy opening and closing.
7/ Between the bathroom and the bedroom there is a wall of semi-frosted glass. Bad luck if you want to sleep and someone else wants to have a shower. This is common now in hotels and I hate it.
8/ Between the bedroom and the main room there are glass panels in the wall, also bad luck if someone wants to sleep but someone else wants to stay up reading or watching TV.
9/ The hotel needs some refurbishment, with peeling paint on some walls, lots of cracked tiles in the rooms. To be fair, there was work occurring when we were there, without any intrusive noise.
10/ We all felt the surfaces in the room (floor/benches/bathrooms) could do with a good scrub with bleach. The rooms were clean, as in swept and wiped, but clearly hadn’t had a deep, thorough cleaning in ages. The seat covers also needed cleaning.
11/ The website advertises a second restaurant Lemon Cello open 7:00 to 5:00. This was only used for breakfast and was not open during our stay. There was a pool menu available, though.

Once we changed rooms our impression of the hotel improved greatly - had we had those rooms initially this would have been a four-star review.

One further piece of advice - upon leaving the back entrance of the suites one of the first shops is a laundry - only 20,000 Rp a kilo. Much better value than the hotel laundry service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
752,Classic Case of Relying on Reviews,20,December 2017,"‌Sometimes, we tend to rely purely on previous reviews of the hotels we booked beforehand. Usually - like shooting in the dark, we do hit hotels that lives up to its review. This on the other hand was not even a hit, the bullet actually bounced back and shot my left ear. We have read countless of amazing reviews about this place and we took that into consideration before booking (however I do take some responsibility for not checking the place out first). First of all, do not trust the photos unless you are booking the higher tier rooms such as the one bedroom suites (there are 2 separate buildings, besides the villas). You will not see the green-lush garden or the lovely rooms posted online unless you are paying for the correct tier. Our room had a balcony that faces the walkway, which means anyone could climb into our balcony (hey, it could be a good way to make new friends!). The safe was not working. The phone in the room smelled like it had dunk itself in coffee and was left to rot for years under the sun with horrendous coffee breath. And to top that all up - the staff entered our room while we were out for a walk, despite putting up the ""PRIVACY"" sign on the door. We were appalled by this security breech and we felt that if the service was not on par, at least the security portion would have been something we could mark off our worry list. This is not a ""shady"" review to bring this potentially good hotel down, it is merely to highlight what they could have done better to rise up to what this little hotel can really achieve - and that is absolute hotel perfection (did I mention their location is amazing!). Please do not give up on The Haven. The staff are doing their utmost best (the hotel staff are really courteous and would greet everyone on the hotel ground) but the management needs to keep up with the maintenance of the hotel and manage their patrons expectations - maybe start with posting the real photos of the rooms that they are REALLY paying for and train your staff on security breech! Looking forward to see a newly improved The Haven Seminyak someday.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
753,Amazing place to stay,50,December 2017,"We have just stayed in the 1 bed room apartment for 4 nights with our 4months old baby and loved it. The suite was great, the staff are amazing and the pools are great. We are planing another stay in march because we loved it so much.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
754,Amazing service in clean hotel with great amenities,50,October 2017,The Haven has been amazing again. The service by the staff is second to none. The suites are a great size and our stay is always better because of two staff in particular Desy in the restaurant who has amazing smile and always makes sure guests are well looked after and of course the Front Office Supervisor Dayu always treats us with enthusisaism and treats us like family our happiness was Dayu' s priority at all times. The courtesy bus is great as are all staff and security in the hotel. We 100% recommend this hotel to anyone. The private beach club perfect way to relax .,The Haven Bali Seminyak

The accommodation in both is excellent. I don't understand how some people can complain about this hotel.

My daughter and husband are on honeymoon and management arranged special decorations for them in their villa; the staff are simply beautiful and so obliging; breakfasts are delicious; the grounds are kept beautifully too.

I do not have one complaint and congratulate management on a very well run establishment!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
758,The Haven stay,40,December 2017,"We stayed in the 2 bedroom suite for a family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers
Very large room with a common lounge/kitchen area with Brm's at each end with balconies at each room. Includes a full sized fridge which was handy
Only a few negatives as cracked flooring (not a real issue but some may find disconcerting) Bathroom taps not long enough so a little water flow on basin when opening taps (again no biggie)
Pool areas are good and clean and a good escape from the sun if needed, as some lounges are sheltered.
Very friendly and helpful staff
Great location to food outlets, especially ""Grain"" (see my other review)
And only a 15 min walk to the beach, and also The Haven have a courtesy bus to their own beach, (which I did not use, due to like taking in the atmosphere when walking)
Breakfast (included) was adequate and plenty of
All in all a great stay at a very reasonable price considering the size of accomodation",The Haven Bali Seminyak
759,The Haven Seminyak :),40,December 2017,"I know this review will be read by many people so... I hope the hotel management ready :)
I came on the 17th from Dubai, stayed until 20th December 2017.
Overall service was good :)
Food & Beverage - For Breakfast - Boring option, need a small oven to warm the croissant, bread buns and toast bread, instead of using a toaster. It's rainy season, the humidity is high, all bread contains too much water, and cold, not good. What's that horrendous fruit chiller all about? should be placed on a table and covered, that is all. No, you don't need to maintain the freshness during breakfast hour as one plate of fruit will last for less than 20-30 mins on the table. We guests love tropical fruits, so don't worry, we will finish them all, and please cut a bit bigger, it's just not elegant at all cutting dice. The hostess brought me to a table with a chair with lots of bread crumbs, and she just wiped it off with her hands, ohhh i love her.
Room - please change the amenity box, it's just horrible, come on. check your furniture and wall paint, they need a retouch.
Will I recommend the hotel or coming back? OF COURSE! otherwise, I won't spend any second of my life writing this review.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
760,"True to the Name...A Heaven,Indeed!",50,December 2017,"Stayed in the property from 8th December 2017 to 12th December,2017.I have only Pros to write about them because in these 4 days,I didn't find a single instance where I had been disappointed.

Pros:

1. The Location : Situated on the Jl. Raya Seminyak street,this place has access to everything( literally everything) within walking distance.Right from shops,money exchanges,spa's (which you won't need if you have booked their awesome in house Spa) and also restaurants.
2. The Ambiance: Lovely,soothing and relaxing
3.The Hotels staff and House-keeping : Very cheerful with a smile on their face and ready to greet you every time you meet them
4.The in house Spa : You will love to pamper yourselves in their majestic SPA after a tiring day roaming around and sight-seeing at Bali.
(last but not the least)5. The Buffet Breakfast : I will this miss the most.Wonderful spread with an array of Indonesian as well as Continental delicacies ready to satisfy your taste buds.The staff were very cordial and the food items never go 'out-of-shelf"".A full meal will easily make you feeling full till late evening.

In short,definitely I would love to stay there again if I plan to visit Bali(which I will,definitely)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
761,Tired,20,December 2017,"Just checked in - the room is very tired. Must had taken the website photos some years ago.

Yes you can accomodate a family in a 2 bedroom suite but this place is getting past its prime... check in slow, key didn’t work on the room and a meal at the restaurant will be our last.

Best to avoid",The Haven Bali Seminyak
762,Family wedding,40,December 2017,This was a great venue with all types of accommodation to suit all the wedding guests. We had 30+ staying and it was simply wonderful. The staff were fantastic and very accommodating to all our guests. Good location,The Haven Bali Seminyak
763,Indulgence pure,50,November 2017,"Utmost pleasant hotel with top location. Quiet atmosphere, only a stone through away from the center of Seminyak area. Rooms are clean and spacious. Staff is very friendly and well trained, especially highly educated and pro-active front office personal to welcome you home away from home.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
764,Perfect stay for Business and Leisure,50,December 2017,"Stayed at The Haven for 4 nights for business with others from my company. We chose The Haven 5 weeks prior to travel based on their friendly email response and business package rate they’ve offered.

When we arrived, everything was as expected, from customer service, cleanliness, professionalism, well organised, fantastic food quality.. not to mention Great pool, facilities and close to everywhere!

If you’re planning to do business meeting or simply looking for your next vacation or business stay, I’d highly recommend The Haven! Huge Thanks to Ernita (Guest Relations), Pak Marek (GM) and The Haven Team for making our stay a pleasant and memorable one. See you soon!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
765,Pleasant in central Seminyak,40,December 2017,Pleasant hotel in central Seminyak close to everything. Most of the accommodation is well back off the street which gives it a relaxed feel. Staff friendly. A few choices of swimming pools mainly shaded by trees makes it very pleasant. One pool near the front of the hotel has a bar. Lots of choice on the restaurant menu and their local dishes were delicious. Rooms clean and pleasant with large balconies (ours had a day bed). Lovely place to spend a couple of days but it really isn’t 5* when comparing with some of the other resorts in Bali.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
766,Adequate,30,November 2017,"Stayed here with a friend in separate rooms within this hotel for 7 nights in the standard room. This is the second time I've stayed here last time being in 2015 when I stayed in the suites towards the back of the hotel.

It's got half decent facilities gym, spa, bar, two pools and a shuttle to the beach with its own section on the beach. Rooms were cleaned promptly everyday which was nice. Oldies/fall prone people beware. The bathrooms are shower over tub and you have to step up into it and step up over it to get out. The light in the hallway entrance to my room busted. They replaced it once after I had mentioned it then it blew again they didn't fix it but I didn't really care.

Standard Bali fare buffet for brekky (egg station, bacon, sausages, cereals with the Balinese options etc etc). I'm vegan so the breakfast buffet for me were extremely limited (even in the actual Sabeen restaurant to be honest). I ended up dining out for breakfast on the last three days (definitely recommend shelter Bali further up Jalan Raya Seminyak on the left towards Bintang supermarket). My friend who is non-vegan also non-boojie seemed to like the food options. The location of this place is literally near everything so you can eat out happily.

Value for money is nice which is why I really can't berrare the hotel too much. I think I paid $500ish AUD for 7 nights with breakfast? Even the restaurant and food service is cheap.

[Black/tanned/non-white travellers] This isn't limited to the hotel but rather to the Balinese people working in a service industry as a whole. I found the level of service for myself and my friend to be subpar +++ in comparison to the white guests of the hotel in terms of mannerisms, judgement etc which was extremely off putting for myself. I found them to be cynical of myself and my friend (I honestly don't care) but they need to check themselves and their prejudices before interacting with people.

Overall, I am underwhelmed and have left indifferent. It's not bad, but it's not good. I stayed here as a courtesy to my friends finances who hadn't travelled bali before. Food, service and hotel quality was adequate.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
767,Great breakfast,50,November 2017,"We visited The Haven most mornings we were in the area for the buffet breakfast. For around $10 each, we left every day full and satisfied.
The selection of food was great. Everything from crispy bacon and personally cooked omelettes, fish, beef, chicken and rice dishes, pastries and toast. They even had Vegemite for Australian visitors. There was a selection of Indonesian dishes as well.
The staff were great, clearing dishes quickly, and very attentive and helpful.
The restaurant was comfortable, not too crammed in as you sometimes find in this kind of environment.
Definitely recommend this for a great meal to start the day",The Haven Bali Seminyak
768,Right in the Central Seminyak..,40,November 2017,"Haven right located in the central area of Seminyak,easy to walk around for the cafe,restaurants....and so closed to the Bintang super market with an circle k convenient store in the opposite side.

Nice pool,friendly staffs
but many facilities inside the rooms seems outdated and ruined...bathtub,floors as well do need some renovation..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
769,Little piece of calm amongst the storm,40,November 2017,"The streets outside are full of the hustle and bustle that is part of the Bali charm. As soon as you walk into The Haven, you immediately feel transported to a place of calm and serenity.

Absolutely loved this hotel. The grounds are stunning and very well kept. The staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. We upgraded to a suite. It had 2 rooms, a lounge/kitchen, and a huge bedroom. This also meant we had 2 balconies. Best balcony I've ever had. It had a double sunbed on one which was pretty much like a bed. So in the afternoon we would enjoy reading and listening to the birds.

Breakfast was lovely. Plenty of choice. The food and drinks for a hotel were well priced and always very tasty. Buy one get one free Mojitios went down a treat!

My only small negative, is the pool doesn't get a lot of sun in the afternoon. Most days we were grateful for this as it was so hot. However, as a bit of a sun worshiper (we don't get at lot of sun in London) it was a little frustrating having to dive between the palm trees. But the surroundings were so beautiful it made up for it.

Location wise, we had everything we needed on our door step. Having The Bintang supermarket and a money exchange (BMC) 2 minutes walk away was a bonus.

I would definately recommend this hotel, and would advice upgrading to the suites. Amazing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
770,Amazing staff and great place,40,December 2017,I had a booked suites. And it was great location and friendly staff. One of front desk staff name is Mr Arya was very helpful and friendly staff I have ever met. Room was clean and comfortable bed. Breakfast was delicious especially local dishes.,The Haven Bali Seminyak

They treat me like a family member , they are really loveable !! The name of the hotel is haven , and you really feel being in heaven !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
772,"Value for the money, clean and friendly in the heart of Seminyak",50,November 2017,"Pool and facilities were very clean and nice. Staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Spa was nice and overall the value for the money was very good. Restaurant was decent and the prices were not bad at all. Staff helpful when my flight was canceled due to the volcano eruption and I got a good price for my extra night.

Stayed in room 1004 - ask for a room further back from the street you can hear a lot of whistling from the taxi and security guards who are stopping traffic so people can cross the street. Noise from restaurant can be loud on weekends in room but not after 10pm.

The beach club was disappointing. Was a small area that only offered chairs, umbrella, and a towel. Beach shuttle service was confusing and infrequent. No water available at Beach Club and club attendant was present but not necessarily paying attention the whole time. I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my phone on the chair or any important things (such as cash because you need it to buy water or food elsewhere on the beach) because the attendant didn't prevent people from cutting through from the beach to the road.

Would have liked to use the hotel shuttle for pick-up instead of a taxi but 350,000 IDR is excessive when even an expensive taxi from the airport is only 150,000 IDR

Pool and facilities were very clean and nice. Staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Spa was nice and overall the value for the money was very good. Restaurant was decent and the prices were not bad at all.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

785,A hotel that feels like home!,50,September 2017,"For me every time when I come to the Haven it feels like coming home. In September I came back 3 times to the Haven during my visit to Indonesia.
At the front desk Erna, Alan and Arya will give you a warm welcome showing their genuine Balinese hospitality. Check in does not take too long, upon arrival a fresh cool towel is provided. Erna, Alan and Arya work professionally as a good team and they are always interested in your wellbeing.
During my last stay from 24 September till 4 October they booked me in a very nice room with lovely view over the pool and the front desk. I did feel very pampered when this room was reserved for me. The room has comfortable bed and bathroom with a bath. All necessary amenities are provided, like bath foam, shower gel, shampoo, soap, toothpaste etcetera. Everything you may expect from a 4 star hotel.
As on my journey to Indonesia I mostly do lots of activities I am happy during my stay at the Haven I will find everything to relax. At the Haven there are 2 large pools to cool down and take a swim. A small gym for daily work outs. Specially I want to mention Atma spa.
Atma spa offers a big variety of treatments. I have chosen the Balinese massage which was very relaxing.
When it comes to food Sabeen restaurant is the place to be. Every morning a big breakfast is served. Freshly brewed coffee. Fried eggs, waffles and pancakes are made a la minute. There are Indonesian, American and Continental dishes to provide each preference for every guest. To be honest, when it comes to breakfast it taste even better then home.
For lunch and dinner I can also recommend Sabeen restaurant. With Indonesian, Asian and European favorites there always will be something you like. My favorite is their nasi goreng ayam!
At Sabeen restaurant professional staff will make you feel how a guest should feel. Waitresses, Lili & Sehlfie and waiter Arta always serve with a smile. No matter if it is early morning for breakfast or late evening for supper. They always open for a nice friendly chat.
On various nights when it is dry season Sabeen restaurant also serve theme dinner buffets at the pool side. There is entertainment to make your dinner more special.
Thank you Erna, Alan, Arya from front desk and Lili, Sehlfie and Arta from Sabeen to make this visit a memorable experience again. The Haven should be very glad to have excellent staff like you!
I can’t wait to come come home again to the Haven soon.

786,Restaurant Gone Downhill,10,November 2017,"Been here a few times over the years but this time noticed quite a decline in service & quality. They used to offer a cool scented flannel on arrival to freshen up which they no longer do. There was heaps of staff but we were constantly trying to get someone’s attention for drinks etc. We went for the Halloween Buffet & the food names / designs were clever but the food itself wasn’t very good. Tasted pretty average, not a lot of options & the Grill section was so behind it took asking twice & waiting an hour to get even just a couple of prawns cooked! Other guests were having the same problem. We ended up leaving after barely eating anything. Very disappointing!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
787,Nice stay during my vacation in Bali,50,October 2017,"Friendly and helpful receptionists ever, great first impression of hotel. The hotel was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent services. Food was beyond good. Room itself was well equipped and comfortable. I was so happy that there was also free shuttle to beach and this hotel had a beach club.

This hotel has strategic location for sure. The food was also great. For Another good thing may be from this hotel was the free shuttle bus they'd provided for us and the beach club as well.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
792,"Modern, Chill Vibe Right in the Middle of Seminyak",40,June 2017,"Hotel is really well-designed -- a cafe/bar right on the main street in Seminyak so you can people watch, with the hotel itself set back from the street and designed to maximize privacy and quiet. Helpful staff at the desk and attendants ready to help with bags or catching a cab.

Design of the rooms is very clean and modern. The rooms aren't huge, but you don't go to Bali to stay in your room anyway. Air conditioning keeps the rooms pleasant while you're inside, even on hot and muggy days. Nice pool. I believe they also have villas, though I stayed in the standard hotel ... All in all, a more contemporary and high-end feel than you'll get at most hotels nearby -- and much less expensive than the big-name Western hotels in the area.

The only thing that was less appealing to me was at breakfast. The restaurant and cafe/bar are open-air, so they have an indoor/outdoor vibe which is nice. And the prepared food, which was kept under chafing dishes or otherwise covered, was quite good at breakfast. But the fresh fruits and vegetables (and pastries) were often swarmed by little fruit flies (I think? some kind of little bugs). Not the end of the world, but a little off-putting. But if you don't care about breakfast at the hotel, or you aren't someone who's eating fruits and vegetables in the morning, it's no big deal.

I don't want to end with something negative, because I really liked the place very much; so let me conclude with saying that the location is very convenient -- near boutiques and tons of restaurants and bars and even a few 24-hour convenience marts. The beach is an easy walk, but they also have a shuttle to the beach -- and a ""beach club"" where you can lounge, get water and towels, etc. And even though they're right in the middle of things, they still manage to have a relaxed and chill atmosphere.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
793,Happiest Hotel Staff Around,50,October 2017,"From the front entrance you are greeted as a guest from the guy who helps you with your bags to the wonderful staff on reception what a warm welcome. These guys love their jobs and are highly skilled at what they do fast and efficient check in, nothing is a bother always very helpful and knowledgable. Location is great short walk to beach surrounded by lovely eateries to suit all tastes and budgets, 10 mins walk to Bintang supermarket and chemist is accross the road.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
794,Return visit to The Haven,50,October 2017,"Love this place it has everything to offer and more! It has a great location with beach within walking distance but if you don’t want to walk there is t5ransportation to take you down to the exclusive day lounges on a roped off section of the beach. If you don’t like the beach but want a swim you have the choice of 2 great pools again with day beds, sun lounges. The hotel is clean, tidy and the staff very welcoming. The breakfast is fantastic with lots of choices. The location in Seminyak is great with restaurants, cafes and bars all within the surrounding area. There were lots of families and this was great to see without the kids being too obtrusive as we were just a couple holiday and looking for R&R. We are returning customers to this hotel and look forward to going back next year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

The beautiful Ernita organized a stay in a one bedroom villa for us which was just AMAZING!! The villa is huge & is surrounded by beautiful tropical gardens & a private pool.

798,Amazing!,30,October 2017,"This place needs to have bigger type on their laundry list... Congratulations Haven, in my two plus years of traveling they Asia you win for the most over priced laundry bill I've ever received, 80$ for same day laundry?!?! Wow, you must fly it or to Labuan Bajo to get done instead of down the street five minutes to a place I find yesterday five minutes walk from here?!? Amazing!!! The rooms are ok, bed is comfortable, still waiting on the ashtray, day three now, but that's ok, the Coke can in my room works just as well. Sorry if I flipped out a little about the price, I'm not cheap, fifty dollars would have seemed more reasonable.. This place isn't on the beach either by the way.. Lol. Next time I'm back in Bali I'll probably go back to the Kartika Discovery where it is on the beach, allot nicer, and the laundry service is waaaaay cheaper. Attached is a picture of their laundry sheet and prices..I tally had to zoom in for this picture. Have it typed allot bigger in the future.. Won't seem like a con",The Haven Bali Seminyak
799,Birthday Holiday,50,October 2017,"My partner and I stayed at the Haven from 6Oct for 7 Nights. After checking in we went to our room which was infested with Mosquitos. There were more than would normally be expected for the climate, this was quickly rectified by housekeeping who brought us a spray to dispose of them.
The room was well appointed and clean otherwise. There is an emphasis on saving water etc which I found to be a good thing as bedding and towels were changed when required not daily.
Breakfast could have been a little better as by the time you got to your table most of it had gone cold but theres not a lot you can do about that. There was also a good selection for all tastes and cultures.
Service and attentiveness was exceptional.
Special mention to Wah Nick who was always ready to help and serve as required.
The rating of this hotel is about right and I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
800,Great spot to stay in Seminyak,50,October 2017,The Haven is a great hotel in a great spot. Service is always attentive and friendly. Rooms are well appointed and the beds are super comfortable. My 'go-to' hotel in Seminyak. Thanks for a great stay.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
801,Best-Named Hotel of the Year,50,September 2017,"Whoever named this hotel knew what they were doing. It turned out to be a perfect haven in all kinds of wondrous ways and I’d go back there in a heartbeat.

It stands on the fringe of Seminyak’s foodie quarter. In the course of my month’s stay I wasn’t able to sample more than a fraction of the enticing outlets nearby, especially since right on the doorstep stood the hotel’s own Sabeen restaurant which was terrific at any time of day. Apart from that, at first sight it’s not the greatest location in the world, and when I turned up at 3 a.m. I must confess my heart sank a little. Morning put paid to my fears. This is a simply wonderful hotel and I’m frankly worried this review will run too long.

The bar-restaurant of the main hotel fronts a busy road, which turned out to be a huge if noisy source of entertainment. Walk back twenty paces and you come to reception, overlooking the pool (clean, great) and everything changes. How anywhere can be so silent when on the main drag defeats me. My room overlooked the pool, through a gentle screen of palm fronds. You could hear a pin drop. The room was huge (I’m from the UK, where most hotel rooms are about the size of a sentry-box outside Buckingham Palace), clean, well maintained, and equipped with everything one’s heart could desire, including a rain shower, umbrella, huge comfortable bed and splendiferous TV with more channels than I managed to count. This room was kept in perfect condition through my month’s stay, and to my delight it was cleaned early in the morning – a great plus point for this traveller.

All the staff showed true professionalism, a classy mix of friendliness and deference which indicates first-class training.

Once I began to explore, I forgot all about my original misgivings. The hotel is exceedingly long. You walk through to the plush part, where they keep the villas and suites, and by the time you’ve replenished your spirits in the delightful gardens, with its tidy shrines, and walked past the second pool, you’re halfway to the gloriously sandy beach.

The tour desk is outstanding. It would be outstanding anywhere. Everything is tailor-made to suit the customer at a very reasonable price.

It’s a great hotel for families, with organised activities for younger children.

With so many hotels the problem isn’t the problem, it’s the way the hotel chooses to deal with the problem. The Haven scores mightily there. First, beach umbrellas. The hotel maintains a tidy little enclave right on the beach, with comfortable recliners and towels on offer, including a refreshing cold towel service mid-morning. (There is a shuttle, but it’s intermittent.) One day two women were upset to find that only two of the dozen or so sun umbrellas were working; the rest were broken in some way and would not stay up. Together we managed to find them some shade, but on the way back I stopped off in reception and mentioned the problem, expecting to hear no more of it. They took my room number and said they would look into it. This was around 1 p.m.. Next morning, there were some brand new umbrellas and all but one of the broken remaining ones had been fixed.

Room keys. I’m kinda allergic to electronic room keys. They’re always failing. Do I have too much electricity in my body, perhaps? Anyway, the hotel didn’t fail. After the third episode they sent up an engineer, who arrived within 10 minutes and serviced the door lock. He had to visit a few more times and we became quite friendly. If my key failed after dark, they would send up not one but two security guards to ensure that all was well once my key was fixed. They offered to find me another room but I liked the one I had. On the one occasion when I lost my temper they remained impressively calm and next day all was forgiven and forgotten.

I really, really loved this hotel. It sets the bar very high. And the real underlying reason is that it offers the most remarkable value for money. I monitor prices throughout my stay anywhere. The Haven consistently beat the comparable opposition into a cocked hat. For what I got, I paid astonishingly little.

This was, for me, the holiday of a lifetime, for several reasons. The main reason is The Haven Hotel. To management and all staff I say, ‘terima kasih banyak banyak.’",The Haven Bali Seminyak
802,Great Hotel in a perfect location,50,October 2017,"This would have to be my 5th stay at The Haven Suites.
I cant really fault this hotel as it has everything i need and expect in a hotel
The suite rooms are very spacious and airconditioners worked a treat. The bed linen was white and clean as where the towels although some days they were a little grey. Room amenities were stocked daily on the room clean. One point to make is be aware in the suite rooms with shower in the bath this is very hard to get into and out of. I dont recommend this bathroom set up for the elderly or anyone with resistricted movement, i am fairly active and fit but found the climb in and out difficult and slipped on occasions - i would suggest the hotel does away with the bath as i cant imagine to many guests using the bath. There are multiple TV channels in various languages.
Breakfast is plentiful - suggest they offer soy milk. Staff are ALL very polite and respectful right down to the sercurity guards at the front of Hotel they always stopped traffic so we could cross the road and on many occasions sort out a Blue Bird taxi for us. Money changer straight across the road in Circle K very reliable.
Checkin and checkout was stress free. Please note there are digital scales at the front reception to weigh your bags. If you have checked out and not ready to depart for airport there is a locked room for your bags to be kept in - this applies to checkin as well if your room is not ready.
Once again thankyou for making my holiday memorable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
803,Right choice,40,October 2017,"Though a short stay here, we have had a memorable stay in this hotel. The service is excellent, spa is great, food is good. The room is spacious and most importantly the bed is comfortable. Will stay here again on our next visit.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
804,Good hotel,40,October 2017,"A good hotel to stay with affordable cost. The best thing about this hotel is that it is in the central location with shopping places, bitang shopping centre, restaurants, beach, spas, DMZ museum (good watch) and travel booking agents (there are so many within 200 meters) all within 5-10 minutes walking distance. The hotel provides all the amenities within itself like the spa, swimming pool and shuttle for the beach. In case you need to get anything more you can get walk down and either from the front or the back door everything is within walking distance.

A must stay as it is very convenient and the staff is also good and polite",The Haven Bali Seminyak
805,"great food, great location",40,October 2017,"large room, large bathroom with spa quality soap and shampoo, really enjoyed it. The location also strategic in the center of seminyak, but a little bit crowded with heavy traffic from friday to sunday",The Haven Bali Seminyak
806,Great breakfast,40,October 2017,"Second time at The Haven, I like the location, close to shops, bars, supermarket, pharmacy and always a taxi driver at the entrance, the staff are great, the food is very good and breakfast is outstanding, we always get a ground floor room, they have their own balcony right next to the pool....
We had a BBQ night, all you can eat buffet, the food was absolutely yum, for 115 rupiah it was very good value...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
807,"Great moment in Haven, Bali",40,October 2017,Me and my friends staying there for 3 nights. It was such a nice experience to stay there. The front desk staffs were so friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and beautiful. It looks so classic and nice. The food was also good. Another good thing may be from this hotel was the free shuttle bus they'd provided for us.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
808,Great value for money,40,October 2017,We were staying at a local villa in Seminyak and the 4 of us went to the Haven for the buffet breakfast which was only 100K rupiah each. There was a great selection of food available and a chef to cook your eggs. We would definitely come back again. There is free wifi also,The Haven Bali Seminyak
809,"Amazing place, Staff and food!",40,October 2017,"The place is very nice with a very clean rooms and super friendly staff.

The location is good beside the beach and the nightclubs and surrounded with many cafes and sovounir shops.

The reception are very helpful and nice.

The restaurant provides the best food I have ever had!!! The have the best steak!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
810,Relaxing family holiday,40,October 2017,"We stayed at the Haven in a 2 bedroom suite for 6 nights, travelling with 2 teenagers meant the extra space was perfect for us all.
The suites are located at the back of the hotel and are nice and quiet.
The day beds on the balcony are comfortable and a nice area to relax in private.
The rooms are clean and having a full sized fridge in the suite was handy when stocking up with supplies from Bintang Supermarket which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel.
The pool area at the back of the hotel is clean and refreshing, plenty of shade but also sunny areas if you want to work on your tan. Day beds around the pool are comfortable and a nice way to spend a few hours unwinding after shopping/exploring the busy streets of Seminyak/Legian.
Its only a 10 minute walk to the beach to watch the sunset and enjoy a meal.
The hotel staff are so friendly and helpful, always smiling and greeting you when you see them. We tried the breakfast in both the front and back restaurants and they both have a good variety of asian and western selections.
The waffle/pancake station was a hit with our son each morning and the pizzas you can order from room service where great too.
We would definitely recommend the Haven and would stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
811,DO YOU SUSPECT ME AS A THIEF?,10,October 2017,"I was at The Haven last night to meet my friend that stayed there (Oct 9, about 7PM). I decided to park my bike on the Level Ground, and then a security whistling me with his whistler from the moment I'm on the main street till I'm on the lower ground. Then he asked me ""Where are you going, do you stay here?"". I said that I'll meet my friend, he's still at the convinince store. Then he asked my room number. I found it very offensive. Do you think by riding a motorbike I can't afford to stay there? Wrong. I'm guessing if I were a foreigner he won't ask me those question.

So now, dear The Haven management, is it part of your SOP? If it is, frankly, I don't feel comfortable at all. In the past I had stay at The Haven before and I was planning to stay here next month but I changed my mind cause of how you disgust of a local or someone riding a motorbike.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
812,A peaceful haven in the middle of Seminyak,50,October 2017,We stayed for two nights in a suite which was located in a beautiful quiet tropical paradise at the rear of the hotel.The breakfast at Lemon Cello was superb. There was a great selection of food and the staff were wonderful!!! The pool was refreshing and we enjoyed chilling out underneath the Palm trees. Thank you we loved our time here.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
813,Great hotel,50,September 2017,"Our stay at The Haven was very enjoyable. Standard room was fantastic and the staff are extremely accommodating and friendly. Location is good and not too far walk to Double Six Beach although we enjoyed the pool very much. Sabeen restaurant is very good, Breakfast is excellent and noticed people from other villas and accommodations choose to come there for breakfast so word must have got around! Will go back there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
814,Great street views from the dining area!,40,October 2017,"Dined here after a day of adventure, as usual in this area the staff were just amazing and attentive. They really do go out of their way to make sure that you are looked after. The beer was very cold which was great. The only downfall was the pizza was loaded with cheese, just way to much and the meal didn't come out at the same time - otherwise worth the visit from a food experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
815,Is it The Haven or “Heaven”.,50,September 2017,"Still dreaming of this hotel, and the wonderful time we had, especially being there to help celebrate their 8th birthday. Everything was perfects. Staff friendly,location great and breakfast amazing. Can’t wait to go back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
816,Pool is great,40,October 2017,"This hotel was good value, rooms clean and spacious.

Pool was great only problem is you don't get sun in late afternoon but that is common with most hotels in area.

5 minute walk to beach and have a beach club area and a free shuttle to take you there. Service is great",The Haven Bali Seminyak
817,Comfortable and spacious,40,September 2017,"Fair value for money.
Great food and service with friendly staff.
Huge rooms - clean and comfortable.
Child friendly.
Bath/shower difficult to get in and out of.
Would prefer more smoke free areas.
Quiet and peaceful.
Lovely views of the hotel garden and pools from all rooms.
Has villas with private pool.
Fantastic pools.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
818,Brisbane Couple,40,September 2017,We have stayed at The Haven Several times and enjoy our stay due to the location. However this time we found the breakfast not up to standard that we have had there previously. All the staff and house keeper all do a very good job.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
819,A haven from the chaos,50,September 2017,"The suites are very clean and comfortable, king sized bed very luxurious, with a roomy family room. the bath/shower combination can be difficult to get in and out of especially if it is wet and slippery.

The staff are absolutely amazing. The breakfast has a lovely variety.

The pools are pristine.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
820,Excellent !,50,September 2017,"Super qualité de service, surtout le personnel très amical et professionnel de la réception. Ils ont été à notre écoute et bienveillants pendant toute la durée de notre séjour.
La navette gratuite à été d'une grande utilité pour se rendre à la plage.
---
This hotel has very good services especially for its reception & friendly staffs which were very helpful as long as we stayed there.
And also what made it nicer was the free shuttle bus they'd prepared. It made the guests easier to get to the beach. :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
821,Great atmosphere and friendly staff,50,September 2017,"I initially decided to book with The Haven because of it's strategic location. Thankfully, I did not regret this. The atmosphere at the hotel was super calm and relaxing, accompanied by beautiful nature all around the facility. The staff at the reception were always super welcoming and ready to help us when needed. For example, when we requested for further assistance to go to the beach, they directly provided us with a shuttle bus. All in all, it was a pleasant stay to spend with my friends. However, do be aware that it is located in the busier streets of Seminyak. The noise from the streets did not reach our room, but if you are planning a night out, then keep in mind that the streets are busy as soon as you exit their lobby.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
822,nice hotel with best service and staffs,50,September 2017,Hotel the haven is such a good hotel in Bali. The reception was very helpful. The pool was beautiful. The honeymoon card as well. it was good. We felt honored. Me and my wife will come back for sure to this hotel for our next trip to Bali.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
823,Good services and friendly staffs,50,September 2017,It was my pleasure to stay in this hotel for couple days with my family. This hotel has very good services and facilities. Especially for its reception friendliness and shuttle bus they prepared to go to the beach. Very good. 😊,The Haven Bali Seminyak
824,Lunch and Heineken,30,September 2017,"Nice to sit here and watch the world go by , drinking Heineken. Wasn't over ally busy , we just walked off the street for a beer and something to eat . Just average food I thought , and beers probably a bit pricey, but still great to just chill out and relax .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
825,Good Location & Staff - Rooms looking old and tired,30,September 2017,"Spent 5 nights here for a short holiday. I was a bit disappoint by how tired the rooms are looking. Everything is worn and looks dirty (but wasn't tbf).

Staff are friendly and do their best to help you. Breakfast at the back restaurant was good with lots of the hot food being cooked fresh.

Like many hotels in Bali pool side beds are limited and seem to spend more of the day covered in towels but not people.

Personally I wouldn't stay here again. Can get better value for money elsewhere",The Haven Bali Seminyak
826,Staff helpful,30,February 2017,"haven hotel location in Seminyak area, a nice location located in the business center of Seminyak, on the entrance of the hotel we were greeted with a friendly, welcoming hotel reception assist the maintenance check in. hotel rooms are spacious, the bathroom was spacious, unfortunately the power jack for the phone away from the bed, breakfast lots of choice unfortunately none of these are feeling less salt dam seasoning, bland, I tried two times dinner at the haven, keep the same taste food hotel nothing bad on my tongue.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
827,Nice Hotel with really friendly staff,50,September 2017,"Good service (as you'd expect from any good hotels in Bali). The receptionist named Febby was so friendly and gave clear explanation about information of the hotel when we checked in. This hotel has massive compound with beautiful pools, breathtaking natural view and various facilities. I will certainly come back again to this hotel for my next trip to Bali. Excellent service. Keep up!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
828,Lovely stay in Seminyak,40,September 2017,"Enjoyed my stay in this hotel - two bedroom suites are ample in size, great balcony with pretty views of the pool and courtyard area. Staff attentive and very pleasant. The hotel is much bigger than what photos indicate and is beautifully laid out. The pools areas are very pretty, located amongst lovely gardens. The day spa is gorgeous with very pretty views and wonderful treatments. Well worth the little bit extra you pay compared to other spas. Breakfast was excellent and we were lucky enough to sit by the pool and enjoy a festive celebration with beautiful serene music. On arriving late in to Bali we enjoyed our first dinner at the hotel restaurant. Food was very good. 10 minute walk to the beach and surrounded by shops and restaurants, either walking distance or short taxi ride. Recommended stay",The Haven Bali Seminyak
829,Wonderful stay,40,September 2017,"The staff at The Haven is really one of a kind. They're so incredible polite and welcoming, even the pool boys and maintenance guys are overly polite and bows for you every time you pass. The hotel in total are truly a ""haven"" with three pools and two bars in a beautiful and quiet private garden. Only downside is the lack of sunshine for most sun beds. The hotel restaurant is open 24/7 and do also offer room service witch is impressive. The food is great too! Our room had a pretty distinctive smell of sewage in the bathroom at times, but I hope this was only due to the maintenance work being done on the same floor. The wifi was amazingly good for Bali standard! The BBQ's at night are a good idea, with the entertainment and all, but it was not worth it. The buffet was empty for pretty much everything after one hour and they hardly ever filled it up. Better to do a la carte in the restaurant og go outside to one of the great restaurants nearby.

Also, the hotel offer a ""beach club"" with private sun beds on the beach with free shuttles from the hotel. This was great, even though they closed at 5pm, way before the sunset.

I loved my stay here, and would recommend it to anyone!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
830,Spa is amazing,40,September 2017,"We have now stayed here about 7 - 8 times, we love the location and the staff are amazing, always so helpful. Had a bit of joke with staff as my husband is a Bourbon Drinker, and they had Jim Beam on drinks list, but the whole time we were there they had none, so unfortunately we had to drink elsewhere most times but would have been nice to drink around the hotel. We had a great room so quiet, room 4018, furtherest away from everything, only downside the hot water was a problem as it took so long to get there but we learned a few tricks and coped. The Atma Spa was amazing, you may find cheaper outside hotels, but you won't get the professionalism, the privacy or the expertise than at this hotel. I had three different massages and one facial and wish I had more... NEXT time... Over all we love The Haven, and will stay again. The pool area need the decking replace but still a nice area to be around.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
831,Nice hotel,40,September 2017,"My husband and I stayed here last year in september. He really like it so we came back again this year. We have only stayed in the suite room. Which is really big and nice. Staff are really friendly and helpful. The hotel is really clean. In a great location walking distance to all resturants, shopping and only a 10 min walk to the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
832,Honeymoon,50,September 2017,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at the Haven, we had a pool villa very clean and modern! The hotel staff were wonderful, and the pool was a great addition.

The restaurant was okay, we ate there a few times and on some occasions we had to send the food back, but the hotel staff were so good about it they never charged us.

The location is great near great shopping, restaurants and things to do at night!

We also used the spa services and really enjoyed getting a massage.

We definitely would go again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
833,Truly poor Poolside BBQ,10,September 2017,"I used to stay in haven several times, i like this place. I saw bbq promotion advertisement, it was showing lamb, meats and seafood.
I even checked to staff if they really provide all of tgat in pictures, and they said yes. But the buffet was truly poor, they only had shirimp and one kind of fish, fish skewer. And 4 kind of hot foods, and bread, some fruit, 2 dessert only. Additionally everytime when we try to order or ask somthing, there was no one. Even service manager came to empty table, he just pass through , never took empty dishes. And i saw he took a picture of dancers, Even though other table guest was trying to find the staff. Eventually, it took 40 minute to get the bill and the changes because they always disappeared and never take care. It was really wasting the time and money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
834,"Amazing Resort, huge rooms",50,August 2017,"I loved this place, suite was huge!!!! had everything and so reasonable, hotel complex was total luxury. Two restaurants for Breakfast and a huge selection. Amazing pools, they had villas would have loved to have a look at them, they looks really private and elite. The place is huge easily get lost. You can enter from front or back of complex. Large balconies. The only downside with this place was the shower over bath, very deep baths and the way the shower glass is you step in at the end and it is really hard and very slippy getting out. If elderly there would be no way they could use the shower. Wifi here was very good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
835,Lovely relaxing hotel,50,September 2017,"Second stay in this hotel, last year with a friend . However towards the end of our stay discovered the Suites at the back of the hotel towards the beach. Now am staying in a 1 bedroom suite with my daughter and her 5 year old son, this gives us the room to stretch out and keep out of each other's way!👍 can't wait to use the huge day bed on the balcony, terrific location, great breakfast, lovely friendly staff clean rooms and everyone I meet talks to you( maybe that's just me). Next time we come will get a two bedroom suite and bring the whole family. Definitely a 👍👍👍😭",The Haven Bali Seminyak
836,Where is the relaxing-zone????,30,September 2017,"Just arrived at The Haven and it's same as always...
Just a look like it could be a nice place for a few nice days in a stylish area, but what's up at pool side?
Families with screaming children all day long. Hope, it would be better at least in evening times.
Praise the lord for that ""adults only"" hotels.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
837,"Good location, Great service!",40,July 2017,"The hotel is centrally located in heart of Siminyak which is accessible (walking distance) to supermarket, shops and restaurants. Need about 10 minutes to walk to the beach. We reserved a conference room in the hotel for our corporate meetings throughout the week.

Credits to Ms. Ernita (Guest Service Manager) and her team for the excellent service with the attention to details and to our needs that made it a successful meeting.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
838,Showing it's age but a fair value,30,August 2017,Was a high end hotel when it was built but now it's really showing it's advanced age. Nice large rooms. OK breakfast - nothing really special. Friendly and helpful staff. Prompt reaction on service requests. Generally a pleasant stay but nothing outstanding. Fair value for the money.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
839,"Great hotel, clean and modern!",40,August 2017,"Great hotel, would definitely recommend.
Good location, only a 10-15 minute walk to beach. To get to Waterbom and the discovery mall in Kuta was a about a 35000 IDR taxi trip so pretty cheap.
(Would recommend the BlueBird Taxi app can pre book and get estimate cost for reliable taxis)

Hotel was very nice and modern. Rooms were great!! Air con worked well although you were only given 1 key and had to put it in the dock for power etc so everything switched off while you were out. But didn't seemed to heat up too much.

Only negative I would have for rooms would be the bathroom drain was blocked so shower overflowed if you were in too long so just needing some maintenance.

Also could use more deck chairs next to the pool, but nice pool.

Restaurant there, Sabeen, was pretty good. Breakfast was great, the best buffet one we had come across on our stays.
It was faster service getting room service though. In restaurant the wait was fairly decent. But had live music most nights so a nice atmosphere.

All in all we enjoyed Haven and would stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
840,Really Paradise in Seminyak,50,September 2017,Had a great stay at The Haven Bali..Warm welcoming by Receptinist and comfortable room. Got an upgrade to Suite room and woow..it was luxury !

842,Exceeded Expectations,50,September 2017,"My partner and I have just finished our stay at the Haven, we are incredibly happy with the entire experience. We stayed in a one bedroom Villa which was spacious, clean and relaxing. Our room service was the best I have ever experienced with the room left immaculate down the the very last detail. All of the staff were friendly and attentive, and the spa treatments are out of this world. We're sad to leave, but so very thankful for the experience. Thank you The Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak

845,Came here for breakfast,40,August 2017,"We were staying next door at the Horison and saw the sign for breakfast here when walking through resort to get to main street. Kids under 9 are free with paying adult. My son just turned 10 however staff said they wouldnt charge as we were coming from next door to eat. Were charged one day but mentioned this and quickly reversed the charge. I thought maybe they changed their mind after seeing how much my son ate lol. We were pleasantly suprised at the offering.....capaccinos etc were included...none of this perculated coffee. Lots of variety, including vegemite!. Only thing i would suggest is more of a muesli type selection, with the option of adding in extras/more dried fruits & nuts etc.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
846,Reception at The Haven Bali - Top Marks,50,February 2017,"My arrival was rather late due to a late flight arrival. However, Guest Relations, led by Dayu, handled my sign in very efficiently, in a friendly and very professional manner. She made me feel very welcome as a frequent visitor to The Haven Bali. The Hotel has a very welcoming atmosphere, including a warm hand wash and a welcoming drink or voucher for one, at your convenience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
847,Very slow service,30,August 2017,"The hotel was clean and comfortable but a bit dated. The issue we had was the restaurant and poolside service. We were always chasing that second drink or cup of coffee. At breakfast, we were offered a coffee or tea but that was the end of it. We were always having to find staff to access more service. This is frustrating and we found that everywhere in Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
848,"If a Villa's available, book it!",40,August 2017,"Stayed in Villa 606 for 3 nights - the villa itself was absolute heaven and relaxation all in one.
The good:
Location of the property is great - on the south end of Seminyak (more like Legian), it's just down the road from Double Six beach - where there are many shops and restaurants to try. Heaps of mini marts and the Bintang supermarket are a short walk away.
The location of the villas on the property is great too - down the side road, and set back from the main road, means there is very little road noise - you hardly feel you're less than 200m from the road! Try and get one of the middle villas as they (like other reviewers have said) are the quietest.
The Villa itself and our Butler Madi (sp?) - Great. A big lounge area, nice relaxing pool with loungers and a great bed. A bathroom to die for with a huge bath, rainfall shower AND an outdoor shower. A little kitchenette and a fridge - water stocked up everyday or when asked for. Whenever we needed something - our butler was quick to respond - whether it be extra towels, or more water- when we first arrived he showed us all the features of the villa and came back to check on us a bit later. They do a turn down service too - which is cute and sets the mood for when you've returned from dinner and exploring. The in room breakfast (free of charge one time while you're in the villa) was good for our last morning as we needed to head out to the airport at 9AM. This arrived promptly, and there was heaps of food (waaaaay too much for 2 people!).
The best part of the villa was the fact that you're in a large-ish hotel so have the amenities/security of a hotel, but the serenity of a villa.

The So-So on this property: the rest of the property looks a bit dated/tired. You feel sorry for the people on the main floor of the property - as their units require a walk down a fairly dark hallway and face out to the pool - some backing straight onto the bar. Upon arriving at the hotel from the street - I think my partner thought I was nuts in booking here - check in was a bit chaotic and quite loud - the welcome drink was average - could've just given us 2 bintangs and we'd be happy. Once we got to the villa thankfully my partner's tune definitely changed!
Breakfast itself in the cafe (we had the buffet at Lemoncello) - was OK, but nothing special. Much of the food that was meant to be warm was not, and appeared to be sitting there for some time. Didn't really bother us as we found enough to eat.

The restaurant prices, room service and spa prices were all fairly good given it was a hotel - We didn't make use of any of these however, if you were to need to eat in, it's not an issue.

Would I stay again? Location wise, yes. If I was in a villa, yes. In the hotel part, probably not - I'd stay somewhere else.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
849,Decent hotel if you find a cheap deal i.e. £35 pn,40,August 2017,"The hotel is in a Seminyak centre location. About 10/15 minute walk to seminyak square but plenty of restaurants and bars to suit all tastes en route to Seminyak square and close to the hotel.

The room we booked some 7 months prior to arriving was unavailable. We were given a twin for our first night of 4 then our luggage was moved at 2pm to a new room. Frustrating after arriving on a flight from the UK. We complained via hotels.com and the hotel were very apologetic and gave us complimentary 60 minute massages each. The spa was incredible and would definitely recommend this.

The rooms smell musty/damp due to the lack of ventilation from the bathroom however we have found this is common in Bali.

There are two pools, one near the main entrance and the other, better looking pool is towards the rear of the hotel between the ""suite"" rooms. This is the pool on most of the photos. However, with 4 or so floors of accommodation on either side it creates a wind tunnel effect so the pool is very cold in the afternoon.

The beach shuttle is a good service and private section on the beach is great.

Decent selection at breakfast and a decent hotel as long as you don't wish to stay by the pool and use this as a good base.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
850,Disappointing - it presented so well,30,August 2017,"The signage was misleading with a picture of meat on the BBQ grill & a reasonable price tag. Turns out this was a BBQ seafood buffet night (so no meat). The food in the buffet was minimal & warm - not hot. We noticed the flame was off on all the bay marees. It was like we'd arrived after everyone had finished?? Although other patrons did come in after us. Some looked & walked away, some ordered off another menu. The grilled seafood we got (prawns in BBQ sauce & tuna kebabs) were nice. The staff were friendly but trying to explain was difficult. To end the night we were hit with taxes ++ even though we had asked did the price include tax. Overall a disappointing experience. There are much better places around Seminyak!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
851,Good value for money and great vibe,50,August 2017,"We were very pleasantly surprised by this hotel as it was a lot cheaper than many of the other last minute options we looked at. Expectations were moderat but the place surprised us. From the time we arrived we felt welcome and the staff seamed genuinely interested in making our experience great.

That said there are reasons why it is less costly: 1) the restaurant is fine and staff very friendly, but the menu is modest.
2) the rooms (we had a family suite which is great for families with two kids) have got everything you need but they aren't fancy.
3) you have to cross two homemade rafts to get from the hotel to the beach. We didn't mind but some might.

The general vibe of the hotel was great with a good mix of young couples, families, gay couples and surfers. Everybody did their thing and seemed happy.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
852,Excellent location..but the Hotel/rooms needs Renovation ASAP !!,30,August 2017,"Stayed here for 6 nights in the one bedroom suite during second week of August 2017 with my wife.
Let me start with the positives
Excellent location.. the hotel is located very well.. lots of shops across the street..24/7 shops nearby.. double six beach around 10 mins walking if you use the back entrance .. good breakfast spread.. nice pools.. big property .. good room service
Affordable room/ suite rates
Negatives :
It's only when you enter the room/suite you realise the hotel is actually quite old and the rooms need renovations.. lots of cracks on the floorings.. molds on the flooring.. bathroom taps don't work properly.. old furniture.. though the beds and pillows are comfortable..
We didn't have water connection on day two of our stay.. we were shifted to standard room in the main building for a day.. the standard rooms also had the same issues..cracked flooring etc.. as i had booked a suite and they had a water problem ..i was expecting they would upgrade us and move us to a villa but to our surprise they moved us to a standard room.. this was not expected from a 4star property.. they gave us one hour spa and complimentary dinner as compensation.. well the spa was good i was bit disappointed with the dinner as they told us they can only serve a set menu.. i have never come across such a thing ever.. the hotel was compensating us coz of their inefficient service and then too they provided us a dinner with a set menu.. not acceptable at all..
Staff:
The staff is excellent and always smiling
Though i am disappointed with the problem I faced, the staff was trying their best to help me but just cudn manage enuf
But their efforts are worth appreciating .
The guards at the entrance are also good
Always help u while crossing the road a big thumbs up to them..
To sum up if you are looking for a centrally located hotel go for this one
The Hotel definitely cannot claim it as a 4 star property as of now.
They need complete renovations of the room.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
853,Good place to relax,30,July 2017,"My fiance and i stayed at the Haven for 4nights, this was a good place to relax at.You get the feel of Bali and service is good.Breakfast is okay although not much variety.Rooms have beautiful balcony view",The Haven Bali Seminyak
854,Lovely!,40,June 2017,We stayed at 2 bedroom suite ad it was great. Spacious and clean room. A very convenient place you can reach lots of restaurants and shops nearby. However some of the furnitures were a bit old but it was okay for us. My friends and i enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back any time soon :),The Haven Bali Seminyak
855,"Nice Rooms, value for money!",50,August 2017,"The rooms are cozy, the balcony is great with a nice view of the pool. I love the location at the center of Seminyak shopping road and short walk to the beach and Cocoon beach club. Would definitely come back!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
856,Fantastic,50,August 2017,We stayed here in a one bedroom suite and it was fantastic ... room was beautiful clean and spacious ..great location to shops and beach and lots of places to eat .. we didn't eat here as we found amazing little places close by ... drinks were standard hotel prices as expected and good service .. check in and out was fast and no fuss ... pool fantastic .. would stay again,The Haven Bali Seminyak
857,U get what u pay for,30,June 2017,"We got this hotel for pretty cheap, we stayed 10nights in a one bedroom suite then 4 nights in a villa.

On arrival at 11pm we checked in got our swipe key, all was going well until we got to the door and key didn't work. It took about 4 staff and one hour of waiting outside the room for me to finally crack it and ask for a different room. Even though we had been waiting an hr and it was now midnight they were reluctant to give us another room. After asking for duty manager we got moved to another room.

The suite was HUGE it's basically a one bedroom unit. The room however was in really poor condition, they definitely need to renovate. The bath is a huge falls risk- if anyone is even slightly disabled do not come here.

Breakfast was great and if ur in a suite stay at the breakfast down the back- much more peaceful and cooler.

The vibe in the pool is awesome, the suites have daybeds which were awesome.

The main let down was our swipe key kept failing- like each day we were locked out at least once which was extremely frustrating as the lobby ain't close by!

The villa was amazing! Full stop!!!!

Despite the key being horrible and annoying would come back as it was in a good location and cheap as.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
858,Family Holiday Bali,50,August 2017,Must recommend this Hotel the service staff management you could not fault. Just about every night they had buffet meal and show with cost so very reasonable. Breakfast so good everything you wanted was there from eggs to waffles always looked after. We were given ground floor room opposite the pool loved it. Also have shuttle bus to beach with hotels chairs for you to sit and enjoy all so private.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
859,Modern Balinese Style Hotel at strategic location,40,August 2017,"I stayed at this hotel for 2nd times. It's not new hotel, but well maintained and home. The like the modern Balinese style ambiance. I always choose The Haven Suite because each room has big living room and pantry, on top of that there is an alternative lobby at Double Six Street which is much less crowded. I love the location, it's not far from some cool restaurants and cafes like Warung Made, Potato Head Beach Club, & Biku Restaurant.

The breakfast is lovely with a choice of Asian and western foods. I am impressed with the staff, they are very friendly and helpful. The only downside is the internet connection, quite slow.

Certainly I would like to go back to this hotel !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
860,Start of our holiday,40,August 2017,"Stayed here for one week and the location was great amid the hustle and bustle but rooms quiet . We had an initial problem with our room regarding mound and mildew and found that our fridge wasn't actually working and circulating but they changed our fridge promptly and cleaned the room .
The breakfast was exceptional and this has been noted by us as we are now in a 5 star hotel and truly the breakfasts don't compare to those at the haven !
We ate dinner there a few times and loved it ... especially Asian night ! A must !
All the staff are very warm and friendly and we were able to get ice delivered anytime ... room service often didn't answer so we just rang reception and they put us through . Pool area small and few lounges but people tended to come and go ... people put belongings on lounges for hours at a time whilst away which needs to be policed to be fair to everyone .
Overall great service and no problem crossing the road as they have staff that literally stop the traffic for you . Was a good mix of age groups too .
A pleasant stay ....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
861,too good,40,August 2017,"Had booked the suite room for 3 nights in August. Spacious, clean, very comfortable. The pool area was excellent. Service was excellent.
Breakfast was a good spread. We are vegetarians, so the live counter of waffles & pancakes was generally used by us.
Great location, so many shops & restaurants in the vicinity.
Used the shuttle to the beach one day...hotel keeps organising activities...could not use due to sightseeing.
Highly recommended.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
862,First trip to Bali,50,August 2017,"We stayed in a room on the bottom floor facing the pool and courthard, was a great location - extremely quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the main road. Mini mart right across from the hotel which was super convenient. Breakfast was included and delicious, a mix of different foods every morning. We also watched two of their dinner shows which was entertaining and food was great as usual. Room was big enough for two people to spread and not feel ontop of each other. Would absolutely recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Seminyak as pretty much in the middle of most things around the area! Did have one issue with the shower but after raising this with the front desk the problem was sorted while we were eating breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
863,The one bedroom suite was very comfortable,30,August 2017,"When we arrived we were told our room wasn't available. They gave us a room for the night and said we would be moved the next day. We were told to wait in this room. I then explained that we hadn't booked a room we had booked a one bedroom apartment. We were then removed from the room, told to wait in the reception while they sorted out the error. We asked for the welcome drinks we were told we would get on arrival. They were appolagetic we hadn't had received them as we had been their over 1-1/2 hrs.
The apartment was clean the bed comfortable but needs updating. The shower was hard to get in and out of. The staff were lovely and very friendly.
Overall this is a very large hotel. It's concantly in the shade ,which makes the pools cold and not inviting to have a swim or sit around especially the pools at the back where the apartments are.I couldn't even sun bake on the day beds. I wouldn't be returning to this hotel. Not much fun to be had when you can't sunbake.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
864,Highly recommended if breakfast is included.,50,August 2017,"We requested when we booked, a quiet, high up, back room including Airport pick up. The pick up was perfect. Our driver waited with a sign in the arrival hall. Very friendly, safe driver we arrived at 2 am at the Hotel. A bit expensive but worth saving all the hassle to find your own transport!
We been very disappointed when they showed as room 1001, level behind reception. We heard all the noise comming from it and more! I went straight to reception and told them we don't accept room 1001. Very friendly and helpful staff but they could do nothing as the hotel was fully booked. Been promised we get another room tomorrow, we had to settle for a restless no sleep night. Next day we could move to 2014 at 2 pm.
Our disapointment, inconvenience, evaporated when we saw this fantastic, huge asian and western breakfast buffet. Incl. egg and pancake station. The best thing, everthing tasted as it looks nice or even better, incl. all westerner dishes, danish and croissants.
About 20 minutes away is their own beach area. An eazy stroll, along shops, restaurants, money changer etc. There you get confy sun lounges, towel, beachfront view all incl.
As we have eaten in various warang, restaurants, discovered whilst we walking to the beach, therefore we can not comment on the dinner buffet of the Hotel.
Only disappointment, the management did not offer any form of compensation for our inconvenience at the first night!
Money changer be carefull!
I always went to the highest rate changer and twice they tried to short change me.
Don't get interrupted while YOU count loud! Even you have to do do it multible times.
Don't let them touch the counted money,
Don't hand your money over before you are satisfied.
Otherwise grab your money and walk to the next money changer.
May with a lower rate but more secure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
865,Lovely Hotel.,50,June 2017,"Me and my other 2 friends visited The Haven in June 2017, we booked the triple bed suite.
The Haven is located on the main road of seminyak, which makes it easier for access to all the places in the area, there is a stretch of various shops as well.
The room was huge, with a living room, dining table, kitchen area and a separate bedroom for u and the third bed was placed in the living room. It had a huge balcony with a bed and sitting area as well.
Beds we're comfortable. The bathroom was complete with all amenities and the water pressure of the shower was good.
The pool area had a good place to sit only that the pool water was extremely cold.
Breakfast was delicious, they had a mix of Chinese, American, and Balinese cuisines.
Overall The Haven is a great place to stay and I would definitely want to visit again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
866,Getaway,40,July 2017,Stayed at this hotel for 7days. Staff friendly. Food very good. Shower could have been cleaner. Pillows hard. Noise a problem at night. Close to all services. Gas BBQs near rooms not appropriate as smells driffs into the rooms.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
867,Nice hotel,40,August 2017,"Our room wasn't so great, we had a wall in front of our balcony, and during the night we could hear loud noises through the windows, even when they are closed, actually we couldn't open them at all, locks were blocked, but it didn't matter we spent most of the time outside. We asked to change the bed sheets, they just changed the top blanket. Breakfast was great though. Staff very nice.
The hotel location was great also, a lot of shopping places and restaurants around, money exchange shops too, and the beach is 15-20 minutes away on feet.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
868,Not impress this time,20,August 2017,"I stayed at this hotel for few times for my business trip. I got the room in the main building just like I requested. The hotel staff are always nice. I always like the location because of it's on the main street which I can easily go to convenient store when I need something. But this time I found a baby cockroach in my room. Even though it's tiny, but it's still a disguise little creature. The check out time was slow as the front staff had to wait for the house keeping to check the mini bar which never ending waiting time while you're in rush for leaving to avoid the morning traffic. I'm not impress this visit. Hope they can improve better in the future.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
869,Friendly staff...,30,August 2017,"We stayed a week here, 3 adults and 2 kids. Got the expected friendly, smiling and polite Balinese treatment by all staff. The architecture of buildings and surroundings was true to the style of Bali...

I think with a review and audit by management or external party, minimal efforts could improve the work processes and service routines, which would improve any customers experience a lot...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
870,"We went to relax, location was good and rooms adequate",40,July 2017,"We had breakfast included, the restaurant was a bit cluttered and the egg station caused delays and blockages. The food was good and varied.
The room was away from the busy street and the front of The Haven. They ran out of the wine (expensive in Bali) we were drinking one evening.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
871,Fantastic,50,July 2017,"Stayed in the hotel part room was great
Only down fall they had shows on a few nights and our room was right out the front very noisy
Food was fantastic
Buffet breakie amazing Had dinner there everynight as my Husband wouldn't eat anywhere else and all meals were brillant
Wifi was great never had any problem
The restaurant does face the road but we loved sitting up the front and watched all the goings on
Had a massage at the day spa but street one next door was better and cheaper",The Haven Bali Seminyak
872,Good Hotel,40,July 2017,"Overall a good hotel. The location isn;t really Seminyak, I would say more Legian. The rooms can get noisy at night, but are very comfortable and kept very clean. The hotel pool bar does some great happy hour deals and staff were very friendly. The hotel does get funny if you don't have a credit card and everything must be paid up front. Overall good hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
873,"Not clean, moldy rooms, smell of mildew, but friendly staff",20,August 2017,"When you book a 4-star hotel, you would normally expect clean rooms and good service. When you bring a short-fall to light to the staff you would normally expect them to ensure that it would be delt with appropriately.

When we arrived, the lobby, pool area, and gardens where beautiful, unique, and tranquil. When we got to our room, we experienced the opposite, due to the powerful, unpleasant smells and lack of cleanliness. I thoroughly read reviews for this place prior to booking so, needless to say, I was very shocked to see a room that was as dirty and nasty as it was. As such, I expressed my concerns VIA Expedia post check-in follow-up which, is shared with hotel management.

They called me shortly after, looking to address the problem. I explained the issue to the customer relations representative (not the front desk staff), as I was told it was her job to ensure they're customers were happy. I told her we had concerns regarding our room's cleanliness and air quality. She quickly responded, offering to send down people to clean the room. I told her that I felt it was not just cleaning the room needed as there was a significant amount of stuff that needed to be addressed, beyond the scope of a basic cleaning and asked her to come speak with me personally.

After meeting in the lobby, I asked her to come down to the room so, I could show her my concerns. I showed her there was visible mold along the floor in the washroom areas and that there was a very noticeable odour of mildew. I also showed her the washroom fan wasn't running so there was no ventilation in tge washroom and that the caulking was done poorly, missing and was peeling/separating from the joints. She said they would clean the room better and spay air-freshner to eliminate odours.

Their end-solution was spaying water from the washroom sink down a drain behind the toilet and spaying the mentioned air-freshner. I'm not sure what their logic was with the drain, but I would assume there were previous problems with build-up of solids in the drain, causing a breading ground for mold. She asked if I was happy with the conditions. I said I was pleased that it didn't smell anymore (as the gf was behind me and I really didn't want to raise concerns for our health in front of her since it is more of a prolonged exposure issue). We also didn't want to switch rooms for fear of having the same issues.

To be entirely honest, I've never seen such a horendous mold condition in any type of hotel I've stayed in. We only had a couple of nights booked here so, I thought it would be best to leave it at that for the moment (assuming there would be some kind of post follow-up) where, I could get the room cleaned/sanitized properly.

Either, this was a choice of ignorance or a lack of understanding of the actual problem that mold causes, by hotel management or they simply don't care about their customer's well-being. Mold grows by releasing spores, these spores are harmful to inhale. This is a health concern and smell is never pleasant. Beyond that, the visible mold was never removed during our stay, the fan was never fixed so, this means we were inhaling mold spores continuously and they will just continue to grow and spread until the mold in completely removed and cause of the problem is eliminated. With the washrooms comprised mostly of tile, aggregate substrates and some drywall, it's very concerning to see the amount of mold that was forming on surfaces that weren't very porous.

I understand that this is a humid, tropical enviroment, but I have been to many places with similliar climates and have never seen any of these problems in even a 3-star or any hotel for that matter. It baffles me that nobody else has noticed or wrote about this yet. To quantify the problem, I have included pictures depicting the severety of the mold. It can be seen all over glass on both the inside and outside of the shower, on floors, around the toilet and had even started to spread to things like the hotel literature on the desk.

The rest of the decor on the resort was pretty good, but there was other aesthetic maintenance/cleaning that could be done on our room such as; cleaning the toilet once in a while, fixing the cracking paint on the walls, repairing protruding screws in the ceiling and proper cleaning of the walls and ceilings as there were visible stains.

Upon check-out, I was asked how my stay was. I mentioned the poor cleanliness of the room again and said there was a stench of mold. Her response was exactly ""Oh, yes. Sorry"" and nothing else past that. I wouldn't stay here again and the positives I have don't out weigh the negatives, but on that note I did find the staff very friendly. Waiting staff generally had poor English and even most of the front desk staff's English wasn't great. They did have good WiFi though, that could be accessed anywhere we went on the resort and the location was good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
874,"Really good, terrific staff",40,July 2017,"Stayed in the main 'hotel' part. did not stay in the luxury suites section, which looks terrific.
Accommodation is very good, spacious, neat and tidy.
Breakfast is excellent, good choice, best meal available
Front rooms can be noisy, due to proximity to road and evening entertainment which was overall great.
Can't cook meat, always too tough.
Not enough sun lounges or chairs around pool, some more would be great.
some parts of the room are 'tired', bath, basin, chairs.
Staff, are excellent, very helpful and accommodating.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
875,Great stay,40,July 2017,"I have passed The Haven many times but never stayed there, so this time I thought I would give it a go as I only needed a place for 4 nights before I went to Lombok.

I was pleasantly surprised, this place was way better than I thought it would be. It's so much bigger and with 3 pools and access to Jalan Legian out the front and Jalan Double six out the back the location is great.

The value for money was exceptional and the while the room wasn't large, it was more than comfortable and had everything you need.

I didn't eat at all at the hotel so can't comment on their food, but there are two fantastic cafes close by, Grain on Jalan Legion is amazing and Sacred Grounds on Jalan Double six was also really good.

Overall it was great stay and definitely value for money",The Haven Bali Seminyak
876,The Haven is a Haven,50,July 2017,"Our first time at The Haven. Was looking for an inexpensive place to spend 7days in Bali and got much more than expected from this hotel. A fantastic relaxed atmosphere. The staff were great, friendly, helpful and welcoming at all times. Booked a Haven Room for our stay and very surprised for the price. A very clean, well maintained and spacious room, we were very comfortable. The Haven is well located in Seminyak with an easy walk to the Beach down Double Six. I advise you take the breakfast package as it is a great way to start the day. Lots of choice whether you want something light and easy or a full breakfast to keep you going for the day.
The Sabeen restaurant is excellent, cant complain about any meal. All were fantastic, great choice and prepared so well. I was happily surprised at all three meal times. The staff again excellent and extremely welcoming.
After 12 trips to Bali over the years this is one of the only places I can say I would return to. Depends what your looking for, I fully recommend The Haven as a Haven to escape the chaos of the day. Thank you to all you made for a very pleasant stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
877,Comfortable close to everything,50,July 2017,"We had a very enjoyable week here and were well looked after by the staff, especially the breakfast staff, who are friendly, happy and professional.
The Hotel has a breakfast that covers every taste and is well served by Sabeen restaurant. They also do poolside BBQ's and Buffets which some times include Balinese Entertainment which is excellent.
The Hotel is a short walk to the Beach and has a private section of the Beach for guests with sun lounges and umbrella. Restaurants, cafes and gentlemen selling beer and soft drink from eskys are close by.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
878,Best value for money hotel in Seminyak,50,March 2017,"If you want a place that is not too far from the beach or the shops and restaurants, then this is the place. The Haven has great units for the price and the Staff are excellent. They cannot do enough for you. My wife and I have stayed in many other hotels and villas in Bali, however the 1 Bedroom units at The Haven take the prize. We think they are the best value for money on the island of Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
879,Lovely hotel in the centre of Seminyak,40,May 2017,"My boyfriend and I stayed here in May 2017 and it was our first stop whilst staying in Bali. The hotel is in the heart of the centre of Seminyak with loads of restaurants, bars and the beach only a short walk away.
The hotel itself is lovely - very modern and clean and the pools were so lovely - especially the pool around the back of the hotel.
There was only one issue with check in - as we had booked a double room but on check in they told us they only has twins available for the first night and then they would move us on the second day. This was a bit of pain as we couldn't unpack properly as knew we had to move the next day.
Other than that everything was perfect and the staff are all so lovely.
I would definitely come back here :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
880,Maybe just bad luck,30,July 2017,"This hotel is quite nice but unfortunately a few things let it down. For the money there would be no complaint with the deteriorating decor and room quality. The garden is glowing with well looked after plants and design.
Sadly for us was that the air con unit failing the entire 2 days we stayed there. On the second night it became unbearable which resulted in a 4 hour period of maintenance after midnight. It's easy to blame hotels for the occasional failure but we were assured after the 1st night it was fixed. There was no attempt to appologuise for the inconvenience as we checked out and they even charged us for the extra bottle of water.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
881,"Great place, nice location. Awesome staff!",40,July 2017,"The Haven was excellent. The rooms/hotel is a little old as a i saw in a previous comment about the cracked tile marble floors. Other than that, it was great. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable. The 2bed suite was perfect for family of 4. Breakfast was pretty good too. Again, the staff was excellent and greeted us everyday. No demands for tips either.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
882,Great facilities and great service,50,July 2017,"We stayed in one of the 1 bedroom suites at the rear of the property and it was a huge space with seperate lounge, kitchen and bedroom with 2 balconies including a glorious day bed. The rear section has its in restaurant and access to 3 pools and nicely separated from the front of the building and busy road by villas. It was very quite and a little bit of paradise away from the Seminyak buzz just metres away. Everything is on your door step. Lovely and helpful staff who each greet you warmly each time they see you - only ate at the rear restaurant, but the breakfast was very good
A big thank you to your team for the lovely birthday cake surprise my sons birthday - it blew us all away. Sting 5 stars and highly recommended",The Haven Bali Seminyak
883,Amazing second stay at the Haven,50,July 2017,"We stayed at the Haven for the second time in July. We're very glad we came back!

The staff work so hard and are amazing! When we got to the hotel we were told that we would have to have twin beds for the night which was not a problem for us. Because of this we received a free three course meal at the restaurant and a complimentary 1hr massage which was excellent!

The food in the restaurant is delicious and at breakfast there is a great variety of food.

The rooms are a good size and very clean.

I would absolutely recommend this hotel, our stay this time was even better than the last!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
884,Blissful!,40,July 2017,"Beautiful hotel in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. A great getaway! Close to beach, close to shopping and great food. Really clean, today, well maintained hotel. Amazing pool, awesome staff who were so friendly and willing to help. Restaurant is really good too.

The Haven's beach club down at Double Six beach is worth a look too. Great way to spend a day chilling. Definitely would stay here again.

Only slight downside - bathrooms don't have a lot of privacy - just a bit of frosted glass! But otherwise, all good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
885,"nice relaxing area , black sand beach. Good selection of villas and suites with own swimming pool",50,June 2017,"rooms are to a high standard , restaurant very good. The hotel is situated on the beach , ( black sand ) swimming not allowed directly in front of hotel due to dangerous sea currents - there is swimming further along beach. There is also a nice large swimming pool right in front of the restaurant and I believe most of the villas have private pool. Hotel is away from the bustle of Kuta and Legian but easy to get taxi to go around.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
886,"Nice hotel, decent price! Lovely staff",50,June 2017,"Ah! Reading the negative reviews about this hotel makes me sad. We had a good experience with them. We went in June (we were told it was high season) and thought the price was fairly decent ($70+/night). Cmon, you're in Bali! :)

They offer shuttle service to the beach and have their own little private area you can lounge and relax. You dont even need the shuttle service because the beach is only about 10 -15 mins walk (longer if you decide to check out the stores you will pass by).

We included breakfast with our stay and we were never disappointed. They also had bbq dinner by the swimming pool area, which included a performance by balinese dancers (both traditional and modern dances).

Their Spa is overpriced and the services we received were not as great.

Overall, we liked this hotel. Would probably stay with them again if we ever visit Bali again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
887,Overpriced & False Advertising,20,July 2017,"As far as price goes, it's too much. Do not pay extra for breakfast. Last night there were 10 very disappointed Australians at 'their' eat- all- you- can BBQ. 'Their' price was for some side-dishes that had nought to do with a BBQ! Beer prices are over-the-top. $5 for a small Bintang!
Heavens help you, if you get a room at the front of the hotel. The noise of 'their' whistles & traffic mean a very poor nights sleep!
Dodgy wi-fi. The staff are very friendly & will assist in all queries.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
888,Family friendly stay,40,July 2017,"We stayed here with our two kids, aged 10 & 8. We got the family room which was huge - it had two bedrooms and a large lounge/dining/kitchen separating the two rooms. It was pretty much a self contained apartment with a stove, full sized fridge and cutlery. The rooms were comfortable and clean. However, the doors leading to the balconies are not very sound proof. Staff were friendly. It is a bit of a walk to the rooms which wasn't a problem unless it was raining. The hotel was located across the road from a Circle K and in walking distance of many shops. Pool areas were nice, and the restaurant served delicious food at reasonable prices. Overall, it was a comfortable stay for the 2 nights that we were there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
889,Not as great as we expected,20,July 2017,"We stayed at the Haven for 6 nights in Seminyak. We were recommended the Haven but It wasn't as great as we expected.

Good points
- Good location - short walk to the beach and on the Main Street ( no one advised us of a free shuttle service or beach club!!)
- Staff were friendly and helpful.
- Room was spacious

Bad points
- On arrival we were asked to stay in a twin single bed room as they double beds available and they would move us room the next day. This was not acceptable, it was not a last minute booking and i didn't book a twin room. So they decided to push two singles beds together ... this I could live with as I didn't want to unpack to pack all away, we just wanted to relax. ( the next day I overheard the same conversation with another new guest, reception putting them in a twin rm instead of a double and moving them the next day)
- Faulty electrical appliances - their hairdryer blew up in my hands and took out all the power for the room - quite dangerous and scary experience
- Very noisy hotel - no way to block the sound in your room from the loud music they put on. Plus drilling/site works being done (possible next door?)
- When you switch off the aircon it still leaves a running water noise coming from the ceiling vent

890,"Location, location, location",40,July 2017,"This hotel was quite reasonably recommended by a Qantas owned travel agency. I am extremely impressed with the staff. As usual, it's the staff that makes a hotel worth staying at or otherwise avoiding.
The place is very clean and the food is ok.
I saw someone criticise the food variety and although it's a subjective view which may be true to some extent, that may be a consequence of running 2 restaurants, which makes it much more convenient for the back rooms.
There is also a back pool which is much more convenient than the front pool and is somewhat quieter as well.
I saw the same person say that the pool gets no sun at all which isn't quite correct.
Whilst the amount of direct sunlight is restricted, it does get some.
In any event, the temperature every day is perfect in the shade and the water remains refreshingly cool which makes a nice change from other hotels pools I've used that have been heated by the sun to a point where they don't provide relief from the heat of the day.
I think it is fair to say though that the room I am in looks tired due to the fact that many of the tiles have multiple cracks and some feel loose underfoot.
I can see that they have a painting progam in place and the front lobby areas are looking a treat as they're being done now. It looks as though the room has not been overlooked in this respect.
The location is perfect as far as access to the shops and restaurants and it's only a short walk to the beach.
The hotel also has a shuttle to their beach area every 2 hours, which I have found to be somewhat inconvenient as a decision to catch it has to be planned much like catching a bus but less frequent. With only 2 days to go we've still not used it but have walked several times. As a consequence, we still have no idea where the hotel beach area is located.
There's tv in every room and the A+ channel (Australia Plus), has the AFL football live. Bonus! There are plenty of other channels as well with something for everyone.
All in all, this hotel is a good place to stay.
We have a 1 bedroom which has a seperate bedroom, bathroom and lounge/dining/kitchen plus a balcony with a day bed to kick back on while using the excellent wifi to watch netflix on your tablet.
I've been to a number of hotels but the wifi here is a stand out winner. My tablet shows 72Mbps connection which is a really nice touch.
It isn't for everyone but for those who like the centralised location, like me, it works.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
891,"Nice, but could be better",40,July 2017,"We consider ourselves seasoned travellers, and we normally book our own accomodation ( this is our 4th overseas trip in the last 9 months)

This time we left it to a travel agent

Whilst the room is nice ( we've got a 1br suite with adjoining 2nd br) but it's tired

Nice, but just needs those little touches

2 adult pools, the back one which we overlook, basically gets no sunlight, so unless you like a fresh swim, it's not fantastic.

Breakfast, well really nothing to rave about. Basic breakfast, not a lot of mixing it up.

Location is good, but having stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott in January this year, that runs rings around The Haven.

As I've said it's nice but we've experience better",The Haven Bali Seminyak
892,Family and Friends,40,May 2017,"Was unsure of the Hotel when we arrived, but it was midnight. Interconnecting rooms weren't set up properly. The staff we very accomodating with this matter and had it sorted in about 10 minutes. The buffet breakfast was very nice and fresh, and was always getting topped up with food, so you didn't have to wait. By the second day we would definitely stay here again. Great location and great staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
893,Good hotel in a busy place,30,June 2017,"This hotel has an excellent restaurant and bar which fronts onto the street. The food was tasty and well presented, and the entertainment in the evening was good. The service in the restaurant and bar was friendly, efficient and quick The poolside parties are very loud ,so probably not the best place to stay if you are seeking peace and quiet, but a good place if partying is what you want to do. The room was of a reasonable standard although the frosted glass bathroom may not be to everyone's taste.. The spa had a lovely atmosphere. It was a very pleasant to sit by the outside spa area having a pedicure done by charming and professional ladies. A good place to stay in Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
894,Make sure not to touch any items,20,July 2017,"More expensive than anything we bought on holiday for a couple of spots on quilt from tatt.
Hotel is ok but items for wash were $70 aud. With no choice. Didn't get any options .
Also quite expensive in general in comparison to other hotels for Dodd, beverage and services.
We also stayed at champlung sari in Ubud and Wina Holiday in Kuta. Both had heaps better service and no hidden costs. Also these were less stars than the haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
895,Super visit staff location rooms,50,June 2017,"This is the 5th visit in as many years ?
Why - from the reception staff to lobby cleaners restaurants spa all the staff are super friendly and helpful
Beds are super comfy
Book the suite when I can afford it for a longer stay. This visit we had a room with balcony overlooking the pool -excellent
Yes the bathrooms are a bit tired but the Haven has everything . Reasonably priced too !!
Loved that you can get a shuttle to and from the beach
Will be back
Thankyou Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak
896,Best price quality hotel!,50,July 2017,"I stayed now a couple times in The Haven in Seminyak and it's my favorite choice. By far best price quality hotel. The rooms are great, the service and location is also perfect! They also have a private beach area. I'll definitely come back and I can recommend anybody this hotel!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
897,Great for families!,50,June 2017,"Stayed at The Haven in a 2 bedroom suite with our teenage daughters. The suite was very comfortable, central lounge/dining/kitchen area with 2 bedrooms either side of this, both complete with bathrooms. Beds & pillows were super comfy! We were situated on the 2nd floor and had a balcony overlooking the second pool. The wet areas did have areas of mould appearing and some cracking but this is to be expected in Bali humidity. Our room was cleaned and beds made each day.

Breakfast was average but did the trick each morning. Kids enjoyed the pancake station. Staff were very friendly, helpful and always smiling.

We couldn't fault The Haven and would stay here again. Very reasonably priced for families and set in a great location.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
898,Just as we remembered ...,50,July 2017,"which was a good thing having stayed here some four years ago everything was familiar and just as we remembered during our first fabulous stay in 2013. Sure - the decor has tired but the spacious 2 bedroom suites are located in an oasis of beauty and quiet well positioned in the lower end of Seminyak bordering Legian. Staff wonderfully attentive, friendly and responsive, walking distance to Double 6 Beach cafes, Havens own ""Beach Club"" (let's call it an area with lounges but still great to be able to access) and excellent breakfast buffet. It'll need a lick of paint, some room flooring upgrades soon but highly recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
899,luxurious,50,March 2017,"It was an extremely luxurious hotel and 4 swimming pools 2 deep ones and 2 shallow.1 swimming pool had a basket ball at the wall. the atma spa was very relaxinng. the 2 bedroom suite had 2 huge balconies,1 with a double bed and 1 with a single bed plus a kitchen.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
900,Great value for money.,40,June 2017,"I spent 4 nights there for a long weekend. It is located on the main strip of Seminyak with plenty of restaurants, shops, etc so as a female solo traveler, I felt safe and secure. The room was big enough and the balcony was nice too. There's a shuttle buggy that takes guests to the Double 6 beach and that's really convenient.
It's a good hotel with a good price if you're looking for something convenient and not expensive. Staff was helpful and courteous. I also had a massage and scrub at the hotel spa - i really enjoyed it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
901,Great Location,40,March 2017,"Bali major activities are about Kuta and Seminyak, and in the middle of them all, there is Haven. A good hotel, not too big, not too fancy, but it gives all that we need to rest and relax. Spacious room, great service, good food, good time. The best part of it is location, just a door step away from the shops and restaurants that cover few km radius to all directions.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
902,Uncomfortable,10,June 2017,"We booked 3 nights in the haven suites for 4 rooms and 1 standard room.
We had an issue at first that The Haven cancelled one suites room WITHOUT ANY NOTICE to us. Thats why they give us standard room.

First we get in the hotel and just knew that our rooms was quiet far from the Legian Lobby. The odor in the suites room was ""old hotel odor"" which like never been used.
There were cracks next to the sink on the living room.
Small trash bin and total was 3 in that big roon.

The towel in our room ( 104 ) one of the hand towel was dirty and wet! ( HOW COME??!- it is said suites? )
The bathroom was so slippery ( the floor and bathtub ) my cousin was slipped and got bruises, and I was nearly slipped out too because if the same problem. The bathtub was too high.

This is just only the first night of our staying, we dont know next what happen next.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
903,"Great hotel, fantastic location but very old and needs renovating",40,May 2017,"I stayed here back in 2014 and booked the same suite, a 2 bedroom which is fantastic. The rooms are huge and the best part is the massive lounge room/kitchen in the middle. Normally my best friend and I stay in single beds and share a bathroom and we decided to splurge and glad we did, everything was fantastic. BUT the rooms are so old and in desperate need of renovating. Even though you book a 2 bedroom suite with a kitchen it has nothing in it but 2 plates, 2 bowls and 2 sets of cutlery. No glasses, no coffee mugs, no toaster nothing. Very weird. But on a more positive light it was very clean, the room service 10/10. Its hard to say anything bad because the resort is brilliant but the rooms are so old. Would I come here again, yes but only if I got the rooms on special. But don't let this review put you off the resort really is fantastic, 2 minute walk to Bintang Supermarket, 10 minutes to the beach and you are surrounded by everything you could possibly want.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
904,Holiday,50,June 2017,"I have been staying @ The Haven now for 7 years and in that time I will never go to another hotel
The reason why and you ask about this all the time why
You should go and see for yourself as I have been for 7 years and I love it like my family The hotel , staff , are so amazing that smile when to first come to there hotel is just like my holiday stated till the end
Thank too Dayu for making this the best holiday and been served by Riyani and the other staff till we meet again xxxxxxx",The Haven Bali Seminyak
905,Great hotel! Great staff! Great location!,50,May 2017,"Having arrived at The Haven very late at night and feeling very tired, we were made to feel welcome immediately! Irfan behind the desk was friendly, happy and genuinely pleased to see us. He was extremely helpful and polite. He even upgraded us to a one bedroom villa for the night. A truly beautiful villa. As we were moving to Tabanan the next morning for 7 nights, I immediately booked our last night in Bali at The Haven.
Breakfast was really good and we enjoyed drinks in the bar and a nice lunch ""people watching"" as they walked, rode and drove past the hotel which is located in the heart of Seminyak and within walking distance to all facilities.
We will definitely return to The Haven next time we are in Bali.
Thanks again to Irfan for being a big part of the memories that great holidays are made of.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
906,Great place to stay!,50,June 2017,We saw this place come up for a really great rate and thought it was all round a great place that we would def come back again with the kids. The pool areas were great and so clean. The room we had was ground floor so access/view to pool was easy. Bit noisy when the band was playing in the front of the hotel but it was only a few hours and not late enough to care. Staff were really friendly and our room was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was included in our stay and was always nice and plenty of it in the restaurant area. Location was great for shopping and great eating spots/beach a short walk (past more good shops!) very good spot to stay!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
907,Lots of rooms,40,June 2017,"Rooms are nice, some TLC required in something areas eg, cracked tiles, however didn't spoil our stay as the staff are very friendly and willing to help at any request.
Breakfast was included, what a great selection! Western style and also Indonesian. I couldn't think of anything they'd forgotten. Eggs made to order in any fashion, also pancakes and waffles made to order.
The hotel is on a large block numerous 3 story, plus ground floor buildings, set amongst two separate large swimming pools.
Very tropical and relaxing!
Only one downfall is a long walk to your room if you forgot something.
I would gladly come back to this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
908,Excellent hotel!,50,June 2017,"We stayed here for 2 nights, we took the one bedroom suite as there were 3 of us. The suite is huge, it has huge kitchen, dining table, comfortable sofa and excellent balcony. The bed is very comfortable, when I laid my head on the pillow I was gone. I had a very good sleep. The toilet is quite big, it is completed with an adequate tub, there is only one thing missing: the water pressure is bad. As there were 3 of us, when the 3rd person showers, the hot water turns lukewarm. The breakfast is quite good, it has good variety of indonesian and western food. Ps: the pancake is amazing. The location of the hotel is very good, we can stroll through shops, there is bintang supermarket which is just 5 minutes away by walking. The hotel staff are really friendly, they try their best to help us.
The only thing which was disappointing is the pool... the main pool bed is always full and the pool allocated for suite only is small and the water is very cold. The pool meant for children looks like fish pond. Other than that we have no issue.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
909,Good hotel,40,June 2017,6 nights great service clean rooms. But only thing missing is no atmosphere at pool bar no music would have spent more time there if they had some kind of music. But overall good hotel good location. Great breakfast to.,The Haven Bali Seminyak

912,One bedroom suite,40,April 2017,"We have stayed here twice in the one bedroom suite. The standard rooms are quite small, so the suite is much nicer and still very affordable.

915,Meeting at Haven Seminyak!,50,April 2017,"Held 2 days meeting in Haven, it was a fun meeting. Haven was so supportive to all our needs. Located in the heart of Seminyak so it was so easy for us to enjoy Seminyak and it's beach after the meeting.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
916,Reasonable price hotel located in the heart of Seminyak,30,June 2017,"I have been staying in Haven twice. Both trips with my partner.

This hotel is located in the heart of Seminyak , around 7 mins walking to beach and cafes and restos are just around the corner.

I won't say that this is 4 stars hotel as you will expect the room to be super maintained. This is not a lavish hotel but decent hotel for you to stay in Seminyak, room is huge, bed and pillow are nice, bathroom - the marble can be better and it is very hard to step in to the bath tub!

There are two pools that are very nice. and the resto- Sabin provided nice Indonesian Food.

The breakfast buffet definitely could be better.

overall, with the price offered, this is a very nice hotel to stay in. easy and comfortable, but not lavish or mind blowing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
917,Room smelt of Mold,10,May 2017,"I arranged a hotel driver to collect us from the airport. We had to wait almost an hour for the hotel driver to meet us at our arranged time at the airport. In addition, what made it worse he had the wrong name on his sign!. I booked two of the one bedroom suites. Both rooms smelt of mold and kitchen area needed a good clean, benches were sticky. Mold in the tiles around the bathroom and ceiling. In the bathroom you have to step into a deep bath to have a shower which was very slippery and dangerous (no matter what age you are!). I tried to change rooms however was advised there were no other rooms available. When I checked out early the reception staff miraculously had a spare room, however it was too late! The reception staff then wanted me to sign a disclaimer to say I wasn't going to social media around my disappointment and I was leaving for personal reasons. Which naturally I declined to sign! No matter how large the rooms are they still have to be clean and odour free!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
918,Comfortable rooms and great location,40,May 2017,"I stayed 4 nights at the Haven with a friend in a twin share standard hotel room. The room was comfortable, clean and perfectly suitable for a short stay. It was nice to have a balcony to sit outside and over look the pool. This hotel is in a great location with heaps of shopping and restaurants on its doorstep. It is also a short walk to the beach. If I was to stay there again I would get a suite as they are much bigger and in a quieter part of the complex. I had breakfast once in the restaurant and it was so so, I have had better buffet breakfasts also the coffee was horrible. Overall a good hotel, friendly helpful staff and I would recommend it to friends and family.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
919,Luxury Villas,50,March 2017,"Couldn't ask for more this place ticks all boxes when choosing accomodation. Location is right on the boarder of Legian and Seminyak, down the road from Bintang supermarket and has everything you need surrounding it. Staff are friendly and always greet you with a smile. Great place and I wouldn't hesitate in returning. 👍👍👍👍👍",The Haven Bali Seminyak
920,Nice and relax,40,May 2017,"Ground floor units are noisy, so we moved to top floor. Staff all very helpful. Restaurant breakfast is actually great - however only short walk to better restaurants. Room clean, quality 8/10. Pool area is amazing. Overall great experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
921,2 bedroom villa - amazing!,50,May 2017,"We (4ladies) stayed for 4nts in one of the 2 bedroom villas. Everything was amazing from the cleanliness, service, breakfast and massages in their spa. Would definately stay again for a great price and location in Seminyak!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
922,Wonderful,50,May 2017,"Stayed for 3 nights in one of the 2 bedroom suites. Huge rooms with a large living areas and plenty of balcony space overlooking one of the pools. Room had everything you could need!

Resort has 2 pools which were both lovely!

Gardens were beautiful and very well maintained, and they also spray for mosquitoes every Thursday night which is a great initiative to look after their guests! I didn't get bitten once!

Huge buffet breakfast with options changing each day

All staff were super friendly and have security out the front to help you cross the busy road when required.

Close to lots of restaurants and shopping, perfect location! I will definitely return!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
923,"The Haven Villas, Bali",40,May 2017,"Wonderful holiday. We stayed in a 1 br villa which was appointed with everything we needed. The private pool was cleaned daily and was most refreshing.

The meals were amazing. Breakfasts included a wide range of both western and asian selections and were so sumptuous that we rarely required to eat lunch.

The staff are amongst the best we have seen in the world. Uncertain as to whether their service is just so good as a consequence of their culture, their training, or both but it is absolutely amazing. Any query was handled immediately and nothing was too much trouble. Oh that the service they provided to us (and all other guests) was the same all over the world.

Would certainly return on any future trip to Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
924,Good,40,May 2017,"We stayed here for one night only in transit, got a good deal on last minute website, room was nice, good bathroom, king bed and balcony, my husband ended up with a migraine from the air freshener they use so be careful if your a sufferer, breakfast was standard buffet, perfectly adequate, good location",The Haven Bali Seminyak
925,Excellent Hotel,50,May 2017,"Very nice hotel,clean and cozy hotel,and the staff also very polite.Spa service was very good.We enjoyed the trip and highly recommend this hotel to whoever want to visit Bali in future.Plan to come back again next time for my vacation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
926,Nice place to stay,50,May 2017,"I stayed for 2 nights at junior suite. And it was really good suites to stay. The food taste good, service was really good tho. Staff are very friendly.
the location is near from the beach and there are bars near the hotel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
927,Recommended Hotel to stay.,50,May 2017,"Very nice service, clean and cozy Hotel to spend time with family. They give free room upgrade. Excellent breakfast, and the staff also very polite. Plan to come back again next time for business trip or vacation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
928,Im treading carefully here..,50,May 2017,"I need to be very clear here dear readers. I don't give full marks out easily , however I have to say that this hotel is quite outstanding for the cost. MIND YOU if I was paying double the price Id most likely rate it less than full marks because there's lots of things wrong with it HOWEVER for what you pay (via various discounting travel sites) it is quite a fantastic hotel
The good: Nice big rooms. Big beds .Spacious. Clean. Fantastic staff that are incredibly accommodating NO MATTER WHAT YOU NEED . You can choose a quiet room at the back (where the quiet pool is) or a more lively room (at the front section where the lively pool is) . Room Service was very good ( I wanted a special meal and they catered to my needs - room service prices were ever so reasonable)
Location : To be accurate this hotel is closer to legian than it is Seminyak so dont be mis guided by the address. Mind you its a great location. Close to Double six beach.Its right in the heart of shopping and restaurants and spas. Bintang supermarket a stones throw. Its a 25 minute walk to Seminyak square. Its a half hour walk from Double six beach to Kuta beach (5 minute walk from the haven to double six beach using the back entrance) . It has its own little beach section .(even though a short distance away) Its 7 minutes to la plancha which is a terrific beach bar /Restaurant (see my other reviews) . So overall a fabulous location. Its even got a little gym if your'e so inclined.
Now to the bad (which you should consider irrelevant in light of the great value this hotel offers)
-Its a very dated hotel so there's a fair bit of wear and tear (yet the rooms really are clean and fresh)
-Decor is a bit old fashioned
-The restaurant isn't the greatest ( oh dear and the 5 piece band....dont get me started)
-The lighting in the room is very average (on the bright side , my partner couldn't see my love handles as I undressed)
- The furry blankets at the ends of the beds are a little incongruent with the whole bali theme
But you know what? I just love it!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
929,The staff is friendly,50,May 2017,"Great location and the guest service manager(Ernita Chandrayani) is friendly

Novarita",The Haven Bali Seminyak
930,The suites are a 'Haven' from the busy streets of Seminyak,40,May 2017,"We had four nights here last week, after a quiet week relaxing in Nusa Dua. We booked a one-bedroom suite and we were given Room 305.

The hotel is well positioned in the main road. The staff are extremely friendly -- EVERYONE greeted us with a smile and a hello. There is a mini-mart directly opposite for your late night munchies, and a full supermarket (called Bintang) on the same side as the hotel, only 5 minutes walk when you turn left out of the hotel. Taxis run past the hotel day and night, so you can hail one within moments if you want a cheap lift to dinner/shopping. The BlueBird taxis are metered and the flagfall is 7,000 (+ A$ 70c) We paid A$3.70 to drive to Kuta (plus a tip to the driver)

The Haven is actually in four separate sections = First the restaurant and lobby, then the Hotel rooms with their own pool , then private villas with private pools behind high walls, then the Suites at the back with their own pool and restaurant. There is a second restaurant and lobby at the back of the Suites and if you go down the stairs from the lobby and turn left, you can access a safe lane way road which will take you out to Double Six street - a much quieter way to get there than going out through the lobby onto the main street and turning right into Double Six.

There is a shaded kid's pool at the back, next to the Suites.

There are a couple of things to be aware of before you choose your room at The Haven.

1) If you choose a Hotel Room in the front section, the pool access rooms on the ground floor will be VERY noisy, and offer NO privacy. Everyone walks past your room (there is no other way to access the private villas and the suites) and you are within metres of the pool and the loungers. The area seemed to be for ones who like to 'party' - many guests seemed 'younger' and lots were smoking and enjoying their beers on their patios, and loudish music was played in the afternoons.
If you choose a hotel room on the 3rd floor or higher, you'll probably avoid some of the noise and your balcony will be private, but you will be walking around the building to get to/from the pool as the rooms above ground floor are accessed from a corridor at the back.

2) The Suite area at the back of the property is much more private and has a landscaped pool with shade everywhere so it's not too hot, and many more loungers than the front section, and it has a much more peaceful and relaxing atmosphere (possibly because the Suites suit families and couples). If you're looking for a more 'mature' or ‘family’ atmosphere, the Suites will be better for you. However,

3) The suites all have the shower over deep bath. This will not work for anyone with mobility or balance issues as the bath is quite slippery when wet, requiring care when getting into/out of the shower/bath. There is no anti-slip mat on the bottom of the bath (I underlined that suggestion on my Guest Comment card)

4). and this is a biggie if you like to tan......
The Suites pool gets very little direct sun (we went in May so that could change at other times of the year if the sun is higher in the sky) so the pool remains quite cool. There were only two loungers around the pool which had full sun on them. However, each suite comes with a day bed on the balcony which I used to sunbake, BUT suites on the RH side (rooms from 111 - 619) would NEVER get any sun on the balcony, and suites on the LH side (rooms from 101 to 609) would only get sun on the balcony day beds from the second floor up, due to the plants and trees around the pool shading the lower floors. ** You will get full sun all day around the Hotel Pool at the front so that's an option for your tanning needs if you want the best of both worlds.

The Haven Suites provides a great 'welcome pack' with 2 toothbrushes and 2 toothpastes, a comb, a shower cap and hair tie, a small sewing kit, a nail file, make up removal swabs and ear buds. Also Shampoo/Conditioner/Bath Gel and Body Lotion. We were given 2 x 500ml bottles of water daily so we had to buy more (less than $1 for 1.5 litres at the supermarket).

There is a full refrigerator/freezer and 2 hotplates and a double sink. Tea/coffee is provided but only creamer sachets in the room - ask for fresh milk and they'll bring it to your room. There are two sets of cutlery provided but if you want to cook for yourself (and why would you on holidays !?) ask for cooking utensils to be brought to your room.

The furnishings are comfortable. The bed was King Sized and super comfortable. The A/C was strong. We had 64 TV channels to choose from (although only around 20 were English).

BONUS ++ F REE STRONG WI-FI EVERYWHERE, ICLUDING IN OUR SUITE -- a big plus. ++

I would recommend The Haven as a good place to stay in Seminyak if you’re looking for something central.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
931,Not really a haven,10,May 2017,"I would not recommend. Definitely not 4stars. My biggest disappointment was paying a premium for the one bedroom suite. Don't trust the photos from the hotel!

Here's a list of a few issues we ran into:
- Dirty bathroom. There was mould around the sink, dripping toilet bidet, sewer smell as soon as we walked in and the toilet needed a decent scrub!
- Bathtub was very hard to step in and out of. Mould stains around the edges of the bath turned us off having a bath in there.
- The hot water tap heated up while we had a shower and we almost burnt our fingers turning it off. This a safety risk especially if there are little kids in the bath.
- WiFi was poor. We had issues trying to connect and when I rang reception their advice was to try and try again. We got a letter the next day saying they fixed the problem. We still had issues so I think that letter was more to save their own back.
- Stains along the kitchen bench top. Nothing looks like it has been wiped down for quite some time. Dining table had stains and sticky spots.
- Air conditioning leaked through the ceiling and when we looked up the timber had black mould. Not to add to the fact we could have slipped from the water.
- The floor also had foot prints stained onto the floor. I don't know how long it's been there and that made us worry.
- Another issue was a request to have some table salt sent to the room. Simple request but it never arrived. So we had to walk and get it ourselves. The suites are at the back of the complex so it was quite a walk.
- The welcome drink was some wierd lemon orange juice. They should either not offer a welcome drink at all or offer a simple bintang to fix it.
- Breakfast was bland and didn't look very clean. We had to eat out and there is a place called grain 2mins walk away.

I have stayed at many 3 star/ $50 AUD hotels and I have never come across such a dirty room. We understand this is a older hotel and there is some wear and tear to be expected but we do not accept mould and dirty stains in a hotel which claims to be 4 star.

There are so many rooms to this hotel and perhaps that is the problem. Many of the issues could be fixed with just better house keeping and maintenance.

We paid roughly $135/night AUD and felt ripped off. We could see into the hotel next door called the horizon and that looked clean and simple and cost only $50/night. My advice is either spend a little more and stay at the courtyard by Marriott (150 AUD) or save your cash, stay next door and get breakfast at one of the many cafes outside.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
932,"Honeymooning in Bali, The Haven was a dream!",50,May 2017,"The Haven truly is a little haven away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Canggu or Seminyak. The hotel is stunning with an impressive lobby, a gorgeous pool area, restaurant and lounge, and spacious rooms. The tub alone is enough for a 5 star review but really everything about the room was lovely, with a window seat that looked out to the pool, double doors that lead out to an outdoor lounge and direct pool access, a super comfy bed, and gorgeous bathroom with fab amenities. As if all of this wasn't enough to win us over, Billy, the lead hospitality staff member was just the sweetest!! He surprised us with some honeymoon rose petals and a truly touching handwritten note. We felt like family immediately and were so appreciative of all his warmth and attentiveness. Thank you Billy, and your team at The Haven for an exceptional honeymoon!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
933,Beautiful and luxurious!,40,April 2017,"My husband and I stayed here for a week, and it really was such a lovely hotel. Beautiful crisp linen, comfortable beds...the staff were brilliant and very friendly! Would definitely recommend
:)

The only down side is that the restaurant was very expensive.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
934,Great value,40,May 2017,"First the hiccups: couple of room changes required...first was a twin, we wanted a double) second the air con wasn't working properly and despite two engineer visits didn't improve and the hotel didn't have a working electric fan to lend. On the last nights our electric door lock broke down twice and left us outside for approx 30mins each time whilst it was repaired. Asked if they could host us in the bar with a complimentary drink but this was not allowed...shame really, as that would have probably made us forget the inconvenience...

But positives definitely outweigh the negatives...good location (15 mins by taxi from the airport, 5 mins walk to the beach where the hotel has a reserved area), clean rooms, lovely pool area, and very friendly, welcoming staff who handled the above problems very professionally and in a timely manner! Breakfast was excellent, lots of choice.

So all in all a good visit.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
935,Great hotel,50,May 2017,"Great hotel close to restaurants & bars!.The rooms are a little tired and could do with a little bit of a spruce up but to say that they were clean and pleasant. The main pool ( front of hotel) the service was slow and sometimes you have to wait for a senior waiter to take you order a bit frustrating at times use the pool to the rear of hotel much more quiet and pleasing to sit . Also to the rear of the hotel you can exit to beach and restaurants + bars + you can also get the shuttle to the beach club ! .
The breakfast was good but not great coffee was always lukewarm! the staff always attentive and very pleasant. All in all a very pleasant stay and would definitely stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
936,Another perfect stay,50,April 2017,"Love The Haven , stayed for 2 weeks in April , and can't fault the cleanliness and service of this gem of a Hotel.
Staff are very friendly and happy to attend to any requirements, including providing feather pillows and a large fridge.Our suite was spotless and serviced to a very high standard each day by Agus, a delightful , Happy and obliging staff member.
It was a special occasion during our stay and the gorgeous Ms Dayu had organised a special treat for us which was a lovely surprise.
Looking forward to our return visit in July for another 3 weeks.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
937,Wouldn't recommend!,10,May 2017,"We started our stay in the two bedroom room which was absolutely disgusting. The room was not clean with mould in the bath & shower, a dirty kitchen bench, the floors were not well cleaned & the room was not well kept. Many broken things like doors, aircon hanging down from where it should be etc.

The worst thing was the smell. There seemed to be some sort of faint sewerage type smell in the bathroom that was covered up by an awful spray smell that gave me a terrible headache. I could smell the same spray smell coming from other rooms as I walked past too. Don't stay here if you have asthma or are sensitive to chemical smells!

After the first night I was so disappointed & knew I had a no refund policy so decided to ask to be moved to a villa. I had to wait another night but it was ready at 11am on the day they agreed. They also gave me a small discount on the extra rate although I think it should have been a free upgrade!

The villa was lovely, clean, a great size & the only smell was of nice essential oils coming from the bathroom. The complete opposite to the two bedroom room!

Although the villa was very nice I would not have chosen to stay at the haven had I known how much I would end up spending on my room. I would have preferred to spend that money & get something better elsewhere.

The resort is very big, much bigger than it looks online which means loads of people in not very big pools & lots of noise. You also miss out on the little things I enjoy about Bali like a welcome drink. Instead you get a welcome drink voucher which was just a yuck fizzy drink you have to drink in the restaurant area.

After having lovely accomodation for the start of my trip in other parts of Bali this was not a nice place to end my trip. I would suggest giving this one a miss unless you're happy to have a smelly dirty room!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
938,Excellent value,40,April 2017,"Excellent value for a comfortable room and clean bathroom. I stayed here for a couple of nights and this hotel was ideal for a short stay. Buffet breakfast was great and the staff all really friendly.
The pool isn't huge but there's a second option at the rear of the property that I preferred.
The hotel is at the Legian end of Seminyak so be mindful if you're planning on visiting restaurants at the other end, with the Bali traffic it's a long (but cheap) trip for a few kms!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
939,Nice Access to beach and great hospitality,50,June 2016,"This is the first hotel I choose on my first visit in Bali, I stay several night in Suite room and it's so comfortable and make me feel so welcome with nice friendly staff there.

They served nice breakfast, i spend quite few time in the pool with my books to read and just enjoying the calm vibe surrounding.

If you're night life lover like clubbing then this hotel really near with beach Club there.

Try and enjoy this comfy and stylish hotel as I did.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
940,"Not great, but good",30,May 2017,"I stayed in the two-bedroom suite recently with a friend for three night. The staff was wonderful, and the food was great. It's also in a really good location. It was not super clean, but it wasn't horrible. We shared our room with a lizard, but those seem to be everywhere, so it wasn't a big deal. The A/C didn't work well in the common area/living room, but it was very powerful in the bedrooms. And that is really where it counts. The front pool where the sun is gets very crowded, but the pool at the back of the property was never overcrowded (or filled with much sun). The beach is very close. Just beware that there is trash everywhere. It's sad seeing as the location is very beautiful. Still worth the experience. There is a shuttle to and from the beach and The Haven has a small area with chairs that are free. It was nice.

I had the Atma Experience package at the spa, and it was well worth the money. The only thing I didn't like was the reuse of cold water on my face during the facial and the cold water in the aroma therapy bath, but for three hours at $38, you can't really complain.

Overall the stay was good, but not great. I will try another property on my next visit.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
941,Chilled,40,May 2017,Safety of hotel - lots of selling on the outside! Need new pillows - too hard and flat. Pool near rear of property was very relaxing. Drinks are double the price compared with across road at convenience store.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
942,Haven is Heaven on Earth,50,August 2016,"The Haven should be called Heaven. It was the best Hotel I have ever stayed in Bali or the whole of Indonesia. The 1 bedroom suite had everything a person could ever ask for. Dayu from Front Office is one of the most Amazing Guest Relations Manager I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Coming from a Hospitality Management Background I would feel very lucky to have a person like Dayu to work for me. The Restaurant staff remembered my name, where I liked to sit and even what I enjoyed to eat. PLEASE do yourself a favour stay at this wonderful hotel, ask for Dayu and you will never regret your stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
943,Love their hotel and locations,40,May 2017,"The hotel is very nice and have a good location, but the suite 2 bedroom room is a bit outdated style. They need to improve their cleanliness as the pillow sheet is a bit smelly. Most importantly they need to improve their breakfast. Their breakfasy have several varieties but the quality of the food is just average. With their big occupancy if they improve their food it will be more benefit for the hotel too.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
944,Cozy and Perfect place to stay,50,May 2017,"Great Location, Seminyak is one of our fav location to stay.
Perfect location near the beach, shopping resto etc. Right in the middle of the long street. The room was spacious and clean with a great aircon to cool us down throughout our stay. Would stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
945,Love this place,40,April 2017,"I have reviewed this hotel many times and once again i cant fault it. We were picked up from Airport on arrival.
We always book a suite room at the back of premises.
Rooms are clean and welcoming. The linen is white and towels are thick and fluffy. Bathrooms are fully stocked daily. Rooms cleaned daily with 2 bottles of complementary water. Staff ALWAYS greet you when passing you this is a credit to management. Wifi in all rooms. Breakfast is extensive which a wide selection from western - Asian foods, latte/cappuccinos on request at no extra cost. We used the hotel spa on this occasion and it was very good can highly recommend spending the money. We did eat a few meals in the hotel restaurant mainly due to Nyepi day and the day prior as it was extremely difficult getting anywhere the night before due to road closures. The staff were very busy and looked after all hotel guests professionally on Nyepi day. Will stay again as this hotel is in a great location.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
946,A Real Haven,40,June 2016,The hotel is conveniently located in the center of all-type Balinese attractions and also the infamous night life. The pool and the breakfast is really top notch! I stayed in the hotel section however those bungalows at the back seemed really cool with private pools and facilities. I would recommend this hotel to fellow Bali lovers.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
947,"Beautiful, friendly staff",40,May 2017,"We stayed here 3 nights (my mum and I). We were apparently upgraded to a 'Deluxe' room, but i was pretty disappointed about the cleanliness and value of the room. Looking at the online pictures it looks superb!
It is a tidy room. Beds are comfortable, pool is beautiful and exterior is very well maintained..
But the bathroom was riddled in black mould, the shower flooded the floor because the it took too long to drain and the aircon leaked onto the floor (and note that there is a full length window between the shower and beds, so if you are going with someone non-romantic, this could be awkward!)
This disappointment was all over ridden by the friendly staff that will go out of their way to help. Breakfast was amazing and location is spot on.
Its a pity about the rooms, this place has a lot of potential.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
948,Birthday in Bali,50,May 2017,"Celebrating a friend's ""significant"" birthday in Bali we and a group of friends chose The Haven at Seminyak for our ten day stay. With a range of rooms available from units to junior suites, suites and villas there was something to suit everyone. We got breakfast included in the very reasonable room rate. The choice and quality of the food in the Sabeen Restaurant was excellent. The grounds are expansive and immaculate with two huge pools and a variety of day and night entertainment provided. We enjoyed the pool parties and the bands throughout our stay. Great location, friendly and helpful staff and good value for money!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
949,Very nice indeed,50,April 2017,"Hubby and I wanted a short getaway after a very hectic 2016 and a house move early 2017. So we booked a 5 night stay to coincide with our wedding anniversary.
Got an excellent deal via Expedia. When searching, a special popped up for the Haven in Seminyak for the one bedroom suites. They had been reduced to the price of a mid standard room. No brainer, we grabbed it and were not disappointed.
Organised pick up via hotel. Not a good arrival impression as no one to meet us, so hubby had to carry both bags up some very steep steps. As we had been picked up by the hotel, they would have known when we were arriving and had a porter waiting? Cold towel but no welcome drink. We were both a bit parched by this time.
Check in was painless and we were shown to our room.
The one bedroom suite was located on the fourth floor with a lovely view over the suites pool. The room was a bit dated, but spotlessly clean. Lovely balcony area and comfy bed. As the shower is over the bath, highly suggest that the hotel provide a rubberised bath mat as it can get very slippery.
Brekkie was included and was more than adequate in selections. Lots of yummy Indo options especially in the sweet areas which was a lovely suprise.
All the staff were so lovely and attentive and loved practicing our Indo and Balinese with us.
There is an exit for suite guests at the back of the hotel to Jalan Arunja and a short walk thru the hotel brings you out the front entrance to Seminyak Road.
Only 5 mins walk to the Bintang supermarket for a supply run. This shop has just about everything and not too expensive.
The Haven is split into three sections. Hotel rooms at the front, which could get a bit noisy. Pool villas in the middle which looked quite secluded. One and two bedroom suites at the rear, with a lovely tropical pool area with ample sun loungers while we were there.
Had a couple of massages at the hotel spa. Nice and reasonably priced. The ladies very pleasant.
If we go back, we would definitel book a suite again. Not only for that bit of space and luxury, but for the lovely staff in that part of the hotel.
Thank you for a lovely stay:)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
950,Nice hotel and location is great,40,May 2017,"The haven is a nice hotel. Modest rooms and amenities. My room was down the very back of the hotel which is was great as there was no street noise.
Pools were great, breakfast a must and very friendly staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
951,Pleasant Stay,50,May 2017,This is my second time staying in Haven within 5 years. The staff were extremely helpful and responsive. They were always smiling and polite. Location is great near shopping and f and b areas along the street and near the beach. Breakfast is good with a reasonable spread. Facilities and rooms were clean and everything is generally working well.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
952,Relaxing & rejuvinating,50,February 2017,"When we arrived at 9pm at night, the staff immediately helped us with all of our bags. the check in process was quick and easy, which was great because we where tired from the flight. we had our 8 month old bub with us so we got a 1 bedroom suite which was so accommodating for us. we got to the room and everything was clean and amazing, they had a cot and everything set up for the baby which was convenient. breakky every morning was great, everyone was so kind all throughout the stay. every time we walked past one of the employees they always greeted us. they have 3 pools which is GREAT for when the others may be busy. very central location and the hotel also has a rear access which is convenient when coming back from the beach. Sabeen restaurant does amazing food as well. I really couldn't fault this hotel enough and I highly recommend. if I had to pick one thing it would just be wear and tear, tiny little cracks etc but you get that in most places!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
953,exactly what we needed!,40,April 2017,"Stayed here from the 14th April for a few nights, was exactly what we needed upon arriving in Bali. Staff were helpful and professional, breakfast had a huge variety of options. The hotel was located perfectly, just a short walk to the beach and also to the main area for shops & restaurants.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
954,The villa was gorgeous!!!,40,April 2017,"I have read so many people having problems in private villa's but I loved the idea of my own private pool, but wanted the security of a hotel in a brilliant location, so the Villa at the Haven was a perfect compromise, if you are lucky and book early, maybe direct to the hotel you can secure one of the middle villa's There are maybe only 4 or 6 Villa's each with its own private pool, huge bathroom, and great amenities, we used Expedia, and although a VIP hotel received the first villa which was overlooked by the hotel (no skinny dips here) and rather noisy, I loved the huge doors that ran across the villa, one of the things I hated with Private Villa's was all the open air rooms, with so many mosquitos in Bali this would seem an invitation to be bitten, so a plus for the Haven for me. The Haven was an average hotel, it seemed to attract a wide selection of guests from all over the place, staying in the Villa I had the best of both worlds, quite nice breakfasts, in their restaurant, good security, and great staff and the privacy of a huge (over 2000sq feet of space to call my own) its location is in the heart of the shopping, and if you are lucky to get a Villa I'm sure you will be as happy as I was.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
955,Great Hotel...excellent value for money!,40,January 2017,"We stayed at The Haven for 10 days in January. Room was tidy, a bit dated but clean with pool views.
We complained our room was noisy and they changed us to the back of the hotel to a quieter room.
Staff was friendly and attentive. Breakfast had lots of variety to choose from and fruit and veg were nice and fresh.
We had a problem with the air con not working properly but the technician was promptly sent to fix the problem.
The wifi was quite glitchy,that was the only bad thing.
Overall it was a great stay.
Thanks to the Public Relations lady-sorry I can't remember her name- who quickly picked up our concerns and made us feel welcome and comfortable,",The Haven Bali Seminyak
956,Amazing,50,April 2017,"Good Location, Friendly staff especially at Front Desk and Pool Attendant, They are very helpful when we need something. We stayed at Suite room for 3 nights and really comfortable stay. Will stay again next year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
957,"Good location, average hotel",40,April 2017,"Legian side of Seminyak. Nice rooms (we had a twin bed basic room) with ice cold aircon, and an in room safe. Good value for money. Hotel service was very slow, especially in the restaurant (45 mins wait for a snack/drink). Pool area is nice and breakfast is fantastic. Close to some great shops and restaurants with a cheap taxi ride into Kuta. Beach shuttle is appreciated, but only runs every two hours.

Would stay here again, but wouldn't bother eating at the restaurant.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
958,Hot Water,30,April 2017,"Had short visit to Bali with a friend and booked this hotel for one night, we were excited when upgraded to Suite hotel at the back side, near swimming pool and restaurant for breakfast.
The room seems a bit old, air condition is not cold and water for shower only hot for the first 5 minutes, no hot water for second person shower even after waiting for more than 45 minutes.
The staffs are amazing, polite and friendly, breakfast also very good.

Overall the hotel is nice but need to work on some issues. Will definitely coming back",The Haven Bali Seminyak
959,I'm just coming back here again,40,April 2017,The people and service here are great. Breakfast is fantastic. Location is great as you can walk to quite a number of restaurants from there. The message here is great though a bit more expensive that the ones outside but the convince and ambiance really pays off. Stayed in the hotel section here with my wife but we decided to stay at its villa section next time.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
960,Needs an Urgent Upgrade,30,April 2017,"Have been years quite a few times, this time though felt they need to start upgrading.
Air Conditioning was pathetic so they got a fan sent to my room. Breakfast buffet was ordinary and not to write about. Super helpful staff though they were also sweating and that doesnt generally look good for a hotel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
961,Great place to stay,40,April 2017,We have stayed twice now at the Haven. Love the large rooms n breakfast is lovely. Lots to choose from and really genuine kind honest staff. Good aircon and grounds kept well. Restaurant s close by. Don't need to get a cab to anything as all near by. We will stay here again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
962,Lovely hotel.,50,April 2017,"We have had the best stay here.
The staff are all very friendly and nothing is too much. The front is quite heavy, as has been mentioned, but minor detail. Buffet breakfast is a great spread. The rooms are very comfortable.
A downside is that if you're staying in the rooms around the pool, it is quite noisy especially with kids. You also need to get in early for a sun bed in the sun in the morning.
The spa is amazing. I had an hour massage and facial and it was the best facial I've ever had in my life, even compared to the ones I Aus I've had. I also had a 1 hr massage and it was the best one I had in Bali to date. Yes you can get a cheaper massage somewhere else, but sometimes you just want to pamper yourself!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
963,Nella media,30,April 2017,Nice room but the electricity goes off from time to time. Very difficult to comunicate in english or understand something beyond coffee and toilette with the receptionists. Nice breakfast but if u want an omelette at 6.50 for flight necessities you have to argue cause the omelette guys starts at 7???!!!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
964,"Good Value, Great Location",40,April 2017,"Recently stayed on a girls trip for 5 nights in a 2 bedroom suite which was huge. Beds were comfy but the pillows were not, very lumpy and was really the only let down of what otherwise was a great place to stay. Had a couple of issues with the A/C but once reported were rectified the same day. Enjoyed some wonderful spa treatments at the onsite spa - Atma (AUS$60 for a 2 hour package) and the daily breakfast included with our room was very good. If you're looking for a good value hotel in a great location then The Haven will do the job :-)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
965,The Haven Hotel Seminyak ! Good Location !,30,April 2017,"Four Star hotel very well located on main road in Seminyak. Close to Bintang Supermarket and many restaurants, money changers and mini marts.
Our room was clean and well maintained but like most hotels in Bali the topping up of amenities etc was random.
The biggest fault of this hotel was that smoking was allowed in their Sabeena Restaurant at all times. Pretty disgusting to get mouthfuls of smoke as your eating your breakfast, lunch or dinner.
Unfortunately Bali seems to be the perfect place for smokers to intrude their habit on other people.
The hotel is strangely layed out re the reception and access to the pool area, and poorly lit at night.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
966,Haven on Earth,40,April 2017,"The Haven is what I would rate as a 4 star complex located in Seminyak. It is not on the busy part. Located a 5 minute walk from Bintang Shopping centre. It is not beach front there is a shuttle to beach or you can take the 12 minute walk.

Locally there are a smaller number of bars restaurants and naturally massage and typical local shops.

It is very important that you under stand there are three very different levels of accommodation at this complex. The hotel which is at the front of the complex, the Villas with private pools and the suites that are at the rear of the complex. If staying at the Villas or the suites be sure to use the rear entrance which is dedicated to those guests.

We stayed in a One Bedroom Suite on the 4th Floor 7-12 April.

OK Lets Go:

Arrival Process

This is where you get the first impressions of what will be your home for your stay. The hotel arranged our transfers and as such would have known when we were arriving at the hotel.

The entry to the rear lobby is up a rather steep set of stairs. There was no one to assist us with our luggage which is really a very big mistake. Dragging our own luggage up the stairs is not a good start to the stay.

Typically though the rest of the process went quite well. We were provided with a cool flannel to wipe off the sweat and refresh our selves...no welcome drink while we checked in which is standard at most other complex's of this quality.

The process was fast and efficient and we were assisted to the room by a staff member so things were getting back on track.

The Room

One Bedroom Suite (404)

Those suites all face the pool and courtyard area of the hotel. They are spacious including a Lounge, Dining, Kitchen area all are well appointed and comfortable. There is a full size fridge which we like so we can cater our own drinks and the like.

King bed plenty of storage area nice sized bathroom but the shower (rainforest style) is over the bath.

There are some minor maintenance issues as the hotel is showing some age. Some cracked tiles and calcification/rust (minor) around the taps but this in no way detracts from the quality of the room

Note the rooms are non smoking, but there is a huge balcony where you can smoke. The balcony also has a day bed for you to relax.

Pools

There are two pools in the Suite area along with an infants pool. While we were there we never had an issue sun lounges. I would imagine when the area is at capacity there could be a problem. Generally the pool side staff are quite attentive to you wants and needs and pool side lunch specials seem very nice.

If you are so inclined you can also go the pool located in the hotel complex. This one has games in the afternoon...Volleyball, basketball. It is a nosier pool and has a slightly more party feel to it.

Room Service

The room service menu is extensive (excluding the late night items) the pricing is moderate to cheap for a hotel menu. We only had a late evening desert from room service. It was fast in arriving so we had no problem with quality/quantity.

The late nigh menu is very limited.

Food and Beverage

To us the food and beverage look to be on the medium to high cost factor. So we did not try either at the complex.

Breakfast is served in Lemon Cello restaurant. This is not what you are going to expect, while it is buffet style it is not as extensive as you will be expecting. There are two breakfast areas. One for the suites and villas and one for the Hotel. Naturally we ate in the suites area. It is more interment than most buffets the selection was certainly adequate and crossed cultures a mix of Western and Asian.

I really like the fact that the pastries were served warm. There is as you would expect an egg station and your waffles and pancakes are cooked fresh.

Overall the food and service for breakfast meets expectations

Wi-Fi

This in now to most guests an important factor and the Haven delivers. we had excellent coverage regardless of where we were in the complex. We had multiple devices connected so exceeded expectations.

Staff

Across all area the staff were very good. Pleasant friendly and always will to help and respond to our wants and need.

House Keeping did a great job with our room daily again they exceeded expectations.

The staff realised we spoke some Bahasa so I think they enjoyed it when used the little of the language we have...what was nice was that they remembered and wold greet us in Bahasa.

Comment

We both enjoyed our stay and the Haven very much. While there were certainly family groups there the suite area is very much suited for couples. The whole area is about relaxation and quiet times. The grounds are immaculately kept in a very tropical setting.

We have no hesitation in recommending location for a sty and we will be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
967,Great hotel and good location,40,March 2017,"Stayed for five nights mid March and really loved the hotel. I stayed in a suite at the back of the property and really enjoyed the room amenities. The suite was large and well appointed with kitchen, dining table, lounge and nice bed room and bathroom and two TVs. A lot of different TV channels were on offer to help relax after a hard day's trekking around.

The hotel has two pool areas both are really nice and were popular. I enjoyed the buffet breakfast with a decent amount of food on offer to cater for differing tastes. I opted to have breakfast included when booking the room as it's nice to stroll down after a sleep-in and not have to worry about where you are going to eat.

The gym was good and had enough equipment to be useful with towels and water available and cool air-con. I used this daily to keep up my fitness routine and thought it was one of the better hotel gyms that I had used.

There are plenty of restaurants and place nearby and the hotel is located on the main road (Jl. Raya-Seminyak - Jl. Legian) if you plan on walking or taxing south to Kuta's shopping area, and a 10 minute walk to Double Six beach and a five minute walk north to the Bingtang supermarket with everything you need for supplies. The rear entrance can used to get to Arjuna (Double-six) street which can be used to go to the beach.

The hotel restaurant Sabeen was also really good with some good food and entertainment.

I also had a massage at the Atma Spa, which was fantastic. It's a little more expensive than some others but I had a 100K Rp voucher to use from the hotel which helped. I really enjoyed the ambience and presentation plus I had a great massage.

My only real negatives were that the room was showing some signs of age, but nothing really off-putting. The couches had a slight musty smell but probably to be expected in the tropics. On saying that, the room was very clean and house keeping did a great job at making up the room when asked.

I would definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
968,Real holiday feel!,40,April 2017,"The hotel was lovely. Great breakfast (we had the American breakfast which was plentiful), restaurant is great for lunch, dinner and drinks too. Beautiful pool and fantastic spa which is worth paying a little extra for vs the mini spas outside. Great location, it was easy to get dinner everywhere and it wasn't too hard to get to e.g. Nusa Dua. The rooms need a bit updating but the staff were so friendly and made us feel like royalty that I could hardly care about the rooms itself!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
969,Peaceful hotel with lovely pools,40,April 2017,Stayed here for 4 nights. The rooms were great for the money. I loved the 2 pools giving you the option of shade or lying in the full sun (my preference). A quick walk to Double Six beach and the fantastic bean bag bars. A fantastic hotel in this price range.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
970,perfect holiday destination,40,March 2017,"rooms were clean , staff were very helpful and friendly
food was every bit as good as the venue itself
had a wonderful stay and would thoroughly recommend
this hotel to anyone traveling to Bali
central location with everything available",The Haven Bali Seminyak
971,Perfect location!,50,April 2017,"Stayed 10 days at The Haven and loved it. Have to thank TripAdvisor posters for suggesting staying in a suite. It was in a much quieter section toward the back of the complex rather than staying in the hotel room, traffic noise , pool play, music playing etc. Top tip, get a suite! The Haven has just about everything you could want from a stay in Bali, friendly staff, great pools, Day spa, decent breakfast/lunch/dinner. But let's face it guys there's a lots more to see, eat and do out on the street!
That's what I loved about the Haven, its location. Some really great restaurants within walking distance or a short cab ride. All and any shopping, if you are so inclined. Thoroughly recommend The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
972,Beautiful Hotel,40,April 2017,"I instantly fell in love with this hotel, its so beautiful, clean, in a great location and the staff were amazing. The food at Sabeen Restaurant was really good. I stayed in a one bedroom suite, which was such a beautiful room, the only thing was the amount of mosquito's that were in the room, even when I had kept the doors constantly closed, but i guess this is an easy fix if they had coils in the rooms. The check in and check out procedures took a fairly long time as there was only one staff member on the desk who seemed to be in charge of everything, I actually felt sorry for the poor guy. Above all, a fantastic hotel and I will definitely be back!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
973,Grateful Ppl,50,April 2017,"We stayed at this lovely hotel in April. My daughter took a fall on the stairs, her ankle rolled. ( no alcohol involved).
We needed to get a doctor as she was in a lot of pain and we were concerned about a possible fracture.
The reception organised a doctor. She was escorted into the room by Security, who remained the whole time.
The doctors treatment was on par with any Western doctor. She brought appropriate pain killers, compression bandages and went and brought a pair of crutches for my daughter to use. She reassured us it will all be covered by travel insurance. The hotel staff were concerned and lovely.
I would rate them a 10 out 10. Very grateful
Aussies ❤️❤️❤️",The Haven Bali Seminyak
974,Thank you Haven,40,March 2017,"Recently returned from 9 nights in the Haven hotel.
Staff are wonderful, so accomodating and friendly.
Gardens are manicured to perfection. Pools (and there is another more secluded pool towards the back of the hotel next to the Lemon Cello rest) are beautiful. Great for lap swimming.

Unfortunately the building needs some attention internally. Re painting and the rooms could do with some new soft furnishings and colour as the hotel decor is very bland.

Room small but clean. Beds pretty comfy but the pillows were hard, despite requesting additional 'softer' pillows they were the same.
Fridge with mini bar, tea/coffee.
Very centrally located. 10 min walk to beach. Great little bars down side streets such as double six (runs down to beach with great beach bars such as La Plancha).
And the street that runs past Frankensteins Laboratory) JlCamping Tanduk???? MozerellA rest on this street is great too.

Spa is amazing.

Breakky is OK. A bit repetitive. Despite mentioning on several occasions to staff the bread was covered in tiny flying insects they still didn't cover it!!!

Hotel food and drink prices are quite a bit higher than restaurants on the streets. Quality is nothing special.

Suggestion: to bring in additional customers, feature theme nights with live music/entertainment!!

Would return and recommend!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
975,Service with a smile survives in modern Bali,50,April 2017,"This modern style hotel offers best of Bali! And best of Bali is service with a smile.

Coffee or tea will be served at your table. In Sabeen restaurant all staff is ready to give you a most pleasant start of the day when they serve you with a smile.

The Haven Seminyak and its friendly staff will make your Holiday in Bali a memorable experience! That makes you willing to return every time you visit Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
976,Hell in Disguise,10,April 2017,"We are forced to share our story for the sake of trying to prevent others from having such a terrible experience and poor service. We hope that it will stimulate management to actually do something about so that the entire hotel staff good work is not compromised by a few.

For clarity sake, our comments over this hotel takes place after having other Bali hotels to benchmark where we stayed the previous days.

For clarity sake, we are a well-travelled (35 countries and counting) couple in late thirteens, with expat experience celebrating our honeymoon with nothing but good experiences at Bali.

1) Service First impressions: two staff at the hotel street entrance seem to serve not much purpose other than antagonize guests while drop off, while fully accepting trucks to park ant take their time for deliveries instead of using the garage for it. We observe several situations. They are the fore front hotel image and should be aware of such.

In our case, they actually approached us and stayed staring at us right next to us generating a clear discomfort while we were taking off our bags, without assisting or even trying to assist my wife taking the luggage to the hotel while I was told to immediately remove the ….. maxi Scoooter, that under no circumstance could block or be a constraint to any other vehicle.

Reception – no wonder in the near future self-checking may become the norm. The reception single concern was payment.

2) The Actual Room: lack of proper minimum maintenance and care.

. The bedroom door has a strong door spring / clip that even for a male to open is with discomfort. Such strong door spring is best suited for a bigger and strong street door rather than a bedroom door.
. The bathroom door could not be closed at all,
. The bathroom shower shows rusty marks,
. Half the window curtain does not open and the half that does open has the poor view to a metal grid,
. As per the hotel information provided at the bedroom bomb threats over the phone seem to be normal and warning is given. When was the last time and how often does, anyone actually have a bomb threat over the phone?

3) Common areas: heavy tropical rain took place every day of our Bali stay. At this hotel we had to ask several times for an umbrella to reach the hotel bar. At a different hotel, the reception employee actually took the initiative to approach us to give an umbrella.

4) Breakfast: I suggest management to reconsider how reasonable is it to charge extra for a cappuccino at breakfast, when a continental breakfast has already been paid and a minimum number of coffee alternatives tend to be the norm in identical or even lower grade hotels.

Whilst we understand flaws may happen, we did report this in writing at the hotel and there was no contact or minimum express of concern. Is poor service the standard at this 4 star hotel?

Nevertheless, we would like to send personal note to the waffles trainee since it was actually the only one that had a kind word and a genuine interest that we enjoy the experience showing an actual sense of hospitality.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
977,"The haven, giving more value to money spent",50,March 2017,"Stay at this hotel before leaving to hard rock next day and i realize how much value this hotel given to our money! Only Booked the cheapest room but the room exceed our expectation for money spent. Well thought amenities (plentiful of cotton, they even incl rubberband for hair which is really appreciate by us,girls) the clean room, modern design of the bathroom, and the nice view towards swimming pool.
Stay in 4th floor 4016, perfect view towards pool and reception area..
Shower needs to be repaired tough.
Location, excellent in the centre of everything, near supermarket, shops, spas..
Breakfast is sufficient not extravagant but, tastes delicious..
We tried their spa .. Good, need maintenance in the building .
And on the way to spa we pass their villa area .. Very reccomended , will book their villa for family trip.
They do extramile, i dont like their pillow and asked them whether they have other pillow.. And .. They bring it promptly to us at 1.30am !
Same with spa, they suppose to close at 10pm but they accept us when we were there at 9.45.. They deserve five stars for their service..
Good work guys.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
978,great hotel for low price,50,March 2017,"This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel.
It is in a great location close to shop and Bintang supermarket.
The staff are lovely. The food is nice. Breakfast was limited but satisfactory.
We stayed in the suites which, as before could do with a slight spruce up (cracked floor tiles) But included in the suite price is afternoon tea which is great.
I can't say we had any problems at all while staying here.
If you want a quality hotel in a great location for a cheap price, then The Haven is for you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

txs Mrs Ernita and txs The Haven..wait for our next trip or next meeting",The Haven Bali Seminyak
980,Great value,40,July 2016,"The haven is not on the beach but has a connecting buggy to their private lounge on the beach. The rooms are varied and if you get too close to main road ie the front reception, the noise from traffic starts very early in the morning and emails until late at night. The breakfast and food from the Haven is wonderful. The whole place is very good value with very helpful staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
981,Great location and staff.,50,January 2017,"Stayed at the start and finish of our stay in Bali. We booked 2 bedroom suites and it was perfect for the 4 of us. Breakfast was really good with lots to choose from and fresh coffee. Had a little look at the villas too and they are beautiful. Nice balcony off our rooms with day beds.
I would recommend The Haven, location is easy and staff make you feel welcome.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
982,Excellent stay,50,March 2017,"Spent 2 weeks here in a one bedroom suite, amazing views over the pool area, staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. Room was very spacious and would definitely stay here again. Breakfast has many choices. Nice and close to Bintang supermarket and plenty of good restaurants around",The Haven Bali Seminyak
983,Couple Holiday,30,March 2017,"Stayed here for a week in March. Check in was a bit of a hassle as they didn't have our room ready, so they decided to downgrade us to a room with two single beds, which wasn't a good start to our holiday spending the first night in separate beds. But we asked to upgrade our room instead and they accepted so that was good. Room service food was pretty average and reasonably expensive. Cocktails were some of the worst we had while in bali and way overpriced. The room had a couple cockroaches in it and also a lizard that we tried to get rid of, so my partner was pretty horrified about sleeping knowing there was a lizard near the bed somewhere. Also buffet breakfast wasn't bad but wasn't amazing either. Besides that the room was fairly good, nice shower, good air-conditioning and the bed was very comfy and so were the pillows. Also the hotel grounds were quite nice as well. It rained one day so we had a swim and it looked so nice the pool and surroundings while it was raining. With all the downsides and factoring in the price I think it was pretty fair, although there's plenty of other places in seminyak I would rather stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
984,Disappointed stay,10,March 2017,"Nice looking hotel. Don't be fooled - People are waiting everywhere in lobby more than 7 seperate families for there rooms to be ready and it is 5pm (check in says 2pm). Haven rooms are terrible absolutely terrible smell, and noisy from traffic. Studio okay I guess very dirty. We asked to move rooms and they told us we could move to a room with two single seperate beds and then will move us again tomorrow night, not happening when this is our honeymoon and we just want to relax. Very disappointing. Restraunt very expensive. Wouldn't stay here again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
985,Central location to most Bali attractions,40,March 2017,"I was glad to have chosen to stay at The Haven Bali based on the reviews I read on trip advisor. It was within our budget as well as it has a gym and pool. Our room boy Santana made sure our connecting rooms were cleaned to our standards. The security guards in the front of the hotel also made sure we crossed the road safely by stopping the scooters and cars as well as ensuring we did not leave our belongings inside taxis. I would not hesitate to stay in the Haven again as we enjoyed our stay there a lot plus the fact that most restaurants, supermarkets, shops , tourist attractions were either walking distance or driving distance!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
986,Bad first experience,30,March 2017,"Travel to Bali many times and we usually never had a problem as we check all the reviews etc. before booking a hotel. Our check in was terrible, there was no one to help with bags (plenty staff inside though) half way up the security guard assisted; our room was not ready which would of been ok as we were a hour early; except the people in front got an upgrade to our room type and were taken straight to their room (accepted that as well). We were advised to sit in restaurant and have our welcome drink which we did after asking where to store our bags. Then went back around checkin time to see if ready and were advised another 45 mins ! Advised staff that we are in the restaurant could they let us know when room ready. So had late lunch which came out warm and we could hear the bell going off for ages before the 5 staff standing around responded. Went to check on our room hour later and they advised ready - asked why weren't we advised! (then found out later we could of booked in down other end being in suites - no one advised). No one showed us to our room just got told on level 2, so we went up to L2 and could not find our room, went back down dragging our bags around - really not happy by this time. Spoke to the checkin staff and finally they sent a person with us who took us 3 wings away to our room. Room was big spacous and great verandahs but really smelly (couch was truely rotten - to give dues they replaced straight away). Breakfast was good and the staff very friendly, including the suites staff who helped to arrange appointment at dr's for me. Used the spa that was good and staff very good as well. We booked an upgrade to a villa for our last night, then got told all sold out but they put us in the 2 bedroom and shut one room off but then the morning of shifting, got an early phone call and told that maintenance had started 7am on villa as they found a leak but we checked an no villas had maintenance workers in them. My bag also that night when got back I could not open till we worked out the combination had been changed! It was one number out and same number for years, there was white stuff stuck in the master key section - advised hotel but they said must of happened elsewhere but I locked my bag every day and had been there for 3 days told them all this but.. We would not go back again just because of our experiences.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
987,Can't fault it!,50,March 2017,"From the moment we stepped out of our taxi out the front, it was amazing! The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, every time they pass you they say a warm hello. The rooms are lovely and spacious with huge beds and large bathrooms. TV at, loads of channels and good connection. Nice balcony with a comfy seat. The hotel has two pools and our room was in the second building so it's a bit of a walk to the reception but it's a beautiful path with water running down the sides and a koi pond! The food in the restaurant was really nice and it had a wide variety of options. Great location, right on the main road by all the shops and cafes. They have a lounge at the back of the hotel which is for guests who have checked out but need somewhere to hang out, great shower room and changing room and free buffet food also. I can't fault this place, it truly is an amazing hotel and I'll definitely come back",The Haven Bali Seminyak
988,Just good enough not really special,30,April 2016,"I stay for 3 night with my family..
staff very kind but slow response..

The room is good but not really comfort, mybe bcause i choose superior room..
Tasty breakfast.. and i love the pool.. 💕
But the bathroom key is horrible.. i be locked on the bathroom for +- 25minutes until the staff coming 😦",The Haven Bali Seminyak
989,Nice place!,40,February 2017,"Stayed here from Feb 24 - 28, 2017 with my boyfriend and our friends (two other couples)
Hotel is nice, clean, well located, nice staff
Many shops and restaurants around
Breakfast is excellent
Good spa
Would definitely recommend",The Haven Bali Seminyak
990,dishonesty and bad communication,10,March 2017,"I have stayed at this place 8 or 9 times before and used to like it a lot.

Room was also not so clean with too many ants and hairs from previous guests.
my room was also very loud and could hear neighbors watching a movie and talking at night + people talking at breakfast as I was located right next to the breakfast restaurant

On my last stay, I booked a rate including free voucher for the spa and restaurant.
There was a problem on their website so I paid at the hotel and got an email confirmation of my payment stating the benefits voucher.
Yet for some reason, the manager decided I was not eligible for the voucher. Despite me having a written email mentioning them and the staff confirming them as well.
I could not speak to him as he was over 1 hour late getting into work and they never bothered calling me or responding to my emails.
Communication was very bad ( non existant)

I will probably never stay at this hotel again and never book via their own website as it gives you 0 protection against their dishonest practice.
( and for 20 USD, they know that no-one would start suing them in court...)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
991,Fantastic in every way,50,March 2017,"This place was fantastic. My husband & I have had 5 nights here for our honeymoon and everything has been amazing.
Our villa with private pool was so beautiful. Maybe a little run down but nothing that impacted on our stay at all.
So close to shopping, 10 min walk from the beach and amazing restaurants.
Breakfast every day was lovely, as was the late dinner we had on the night we arrived.
The best part was by far the staff! Everyone was SO lovely and helpful, couldn't have asked for more.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
992,"Simple, Comfortable, Accomodating, Perfect",50,March 2017,The title says it all. Friendly staff always looking for a way to help and make things better. Particular mention for their guest relations officer Ernita Chandrayani. Such a nice lady always helping even when dealing with large family and multiple rooms at once. She and the other staff at Haven really made the trip to bali a good one. Even gave me pointers on where in bali to visit!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
993,Great place to stay,40,March 2017,"Fabulous air-conditioning, clean room, quiet with amazing staff. Second visit, always meets expectations. Close to everything and the pool is great. Come and stay, family friendly. Looking forward to my stay, 7 nights never enough.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
994,Communication is terrible,20,March 2017,"I'm not sure on other people's experiences but I have sent this place multiple emails asking what I think are VERY simple questions about breakfast, the room (more pictures) etc etc.

My sister stayed here and said the place was amazing - so we were basically going to book with them - they were our number one pick for a private pool villa. We were about to spend $2,000 for 10 days, but just wanted to clarify a few things.

They take days to respond - if they even do respond. The last email I sent them was on Monday morning it's now Wednesday still no response. I've had to contact them via Facebook to get them to reply. If this is the type of service they provide BEFORE i'm even there I hate to think what they're like once you're there. Certainly won't be wasting $2,000 on them and will look elsewhere for accommodation on a business who actually appreciated my money and who will actually reply",The Haven Bali Seminyak
995,Amazing place to stay on our last night!,40,February 2017,"The pool villas are absolutely incredible - you have to see it to believe it! I could hear dogs barking in the night, but I am not sure if that was anything to do with the hotel. We could also hear a LOT of shouting from the main pool during the day - when I think the staff could have asked the group there to keep the noise down.
The room had everything we could have wished for an more - comfy beds, two sinks, umbrella, iron, bubble bath etc etc
I would have given the hotel an 'excellent' rating, but the time it took to check out was absolutely ridiculous (with a cab waiting). It even turned out that our room was being checked while we were checking out (absolutely fine) - but by the person that had come to pick up our cases!! We then had to wait even longer for our cases to arrive.
At breakfast, we were asked to wait in reception, as the restaurant was too busy to cater for us. Then they let new arrivals in before us. We finally sat down. Five minutes later, the staff came to tell us the buffet was about to close and they were clearing all the food away. If they let hotel guests in late, they need to leave the buffet there longer.
Moans aside, I really do want to visit this place again. I would love to come with the rest of my family. The location is excellent!! The staff are very lovely!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
996,Central location with lovely service,40,March 2017,"Haven is a great spot to stay, it is central an easy 30 minutes walk into Kuta and Seminyak central road as well as a quick walk to the beach. We stayed in a ground floor hotel room across from the pool. Clean and cool.
Staff are always friendly with a smile and a hello. Always helpful
Breakfast at the Sabeen caters for all tastes and plenty of food. A great way to start the day, the service and staff attentive from Desy showing you to a table with a wonderful smile to the lovely trainee Chrissy on the waffles/pancakes.
Im into being indulged with having massages and the Atma spa is a peaceful and relaxing place to have them, had a good Bali/deep tissue massage by Sumi, reasonably priced.
Only had the one bar/service meal which was average. But the coffee last thing at night at anytime we returned to the hotel served hot and with a cookie.
A nice place to stay and we will return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
997,Awesome Breakfast,40,February 2017,"Stayed for 4 nights by my self on a short holiday
Great service, friendly staff
Nice pool & the best breakfast 👌

Location is also very good

Recommend hiring a scooter so you can explore

Would definitely stay again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
998,The friendly service never disappoints at this well-run and appealingly appointed hotel,50,March 2017,"My company has been coming to the Haven since 2015 and we have twice used the conference rooms there to hold workshops over those visits.

While it is an attentive and well run machine for business purposes, thanks especially to Ernita and Nur on this last visit (although we know always smiling Nur from previous visits too) , it is the way The Haven blends the sense of leisure, relaxation, and staff friendliness that set it apart. Before after and between meetings we enjoy our downtime walking through the nature-lined paths and chilling pool side. The breakfast buffet is fantastic too. Luckily the beach is near enough by to run off those extra pancakes!

On this most recent visit, Ernita, the Guest Services Manager really went the extra mile, by finding adjoining rooms for us in the Suites area under short notice and with the hotel heavily booked. Insider tip: the suites area in the more quiet back of the hotel are spacious great value rooms that function perfectly for our needs as a workspace/downtime social space.

Can't wait to get back here for our next work/fun trip.

999,Strategic Location,50,February 2017,"This hotel provides two kind of rooms, which are hotel room & suite room. Every room has its own lobby, pool, and lift. I stayed at the suite room for my holiday with family. The room is big enough, the view is nice (I can see the pool from my room), the service is good. The hotel is located on Seminyak street so its very strategic to do a sightseeing, find cafe & restaurant, close to Legian & Kuta.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1000,Amazing service for our honeymoon.,50,November 2016,"Amazing hotel with amazing staff. Went above and beyond for our honeymoon.pool areas are great, rooms and bathrooms are perfect! Staff could not have been better, servicing our room more than once a day and providing rose petals on our bed!Thankyou, you really are a haven!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1001,Impressed,40,January 2017,"I booked the Haven because we got a deal through Expedia. My husband & I were travelling with our niece (22) and daughter (23). We had a 2 bed suite. I was expecting tired & tight but it was quite the opposite. Fresh, clean, bright, spacious. Loved the relaxing pool area. We loved the location right in the heart of the action. We also discovered the back entrance lead to the beach, more shops & little restaurants & cafes. This was my 9th trip to Bali & I can truly say the Haven was most suitable for the price point. We used the Lemoncelo Restaurant & pool area. Lovely gentle attentive staff. Would recommend & book again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1002,Worst service and food on Bali,10,February 2017,"Dont eat in their vaganza restaurant. Took 1 hour to get a Nasi Goreng that was awful, dry chicken, a cold pizza and fish and chips that tasted like dishwater and service that said the reason for the delay was the many guests. We were the only ones.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1003,Heaven at the Haven!,50,January 2017,"Located right in the heart of Bali, The Haven was the perfect resort to be at! Just steps away from the beach, amazing restaurants/bars and shopping. You can relax in peace at the Haven - where it feels like you're in your very own private tropical oasis. I stayed in their two-bedroom pool villa. They had a really big pool, but having my own private pool (or rather, 2 private pools was just unreal). Perfect place to stay in Bali - truly felt like paradise. The staff was amazing - very accommodating, and even upgraded us during our stay. Can't wait to come back to The Haven Bali and would highly recommend!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1004,Fantastic Service,50,February 2017,"Although the rooms are a little dated the outside area's are beautiful and the staff provide impeccable service. Breakfast is amazing, staff are always friendly and helpful.

Good location.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1005,simple hotel/ nice suite,30,February 2017,"First of all you must know that this hotel has 2 very different parts.(Haven rooms and Haven Suites) The simple Haven rooms are in the first part of the hotel. This room is absolutely not 4 star quality, i would say that it looked like a nice hostel room. Small, the glass bathroom door is just a step away from your bed. We were promised to get priority check in, free vouchers for the spa & beverages and free upgrade to suite if available, because we have the gold status from expedia. I let the hotel know about our arrival time one day prior to arrival. When we arrived, we had to wait 1,5 hours (so forget about priority check in). The receptionist ""forgot"" to give us our vouchers, i had to ask for them. And the worst part was, that we got room 2001 which is in the corner looking out on a wall. So no upgrade to a suite room. We did not accept this room, so they gave us 2007 which is the same size, same quality but 7 rooms further on the corridor. We requested a nicer room, because this was really not what we expected. We stayed in 4 star hotels in 3 other cities in Bali, and the rooms were all much much nicer, better, bigger. At the end we got a one bedroom suite for which we were supposed to pay 25 euros extra per night. So the promised free upgrade was not free at all. They also forgot to tell us that there is a lounge room for the people who stay in the suites, where you can get coffee/thee and some simple food. I contacted expedia each day 5 days long, but they did not help. After 5 days i decided to talk to one of the supervisors again, and at the end we did not have to pay the extra 25 euros per night. It is a pity, that it had to go this way, because it ruined our holiday a bit. But it was a big relief that the upgrade was free of charge at the end.

Good things about the suite:
- lots of space, big kitchen, big living room, big sleeping room
- huge balcony with a bed for 2 and a single bed, chair, table
- nice view of the beautiful garden and pools
- the best breakfast ever! Everything you can imagine was on the buffet!
- entrance at the quiet end of the street
- many restaurants near by
- close to the beach
- bathrobes &slippers
- good lunch for a reasonable price
- spa: we went 3 times for massage, it was heaven :)

Not such good things:
- all the furniture had a sour smell, like people's sweat, even the cupboard where the safe was, but also the sofa and the chairs in the living room.
- bathroom is old, can do with some refurbishing

All in all we had a great time, but it is a pity that it started the way it started...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1006,"Safe, clean and close to beach",40,February 2017,"Staying here for 8 nights. Stayed in the suites which are huge! 2 separate bedrooms with king size beds on each room. Each room has an ensuite, so plenty of privacy. Big lounge and kitchenette in the middle of each bedroom. Each room had a balcony overlooking the pool.
One end of the hotel is the suites, the other main entrance side is the hotel rooms. 6 minute walk to beach.
Cab fares to Kuta about $3.00 Aus (30,000 rupiah) - travel tip when in Bali when making small trips, use The Bluebird group of taxi's - they use meters, otherwise negotiate at your leisure!
Buffet breakfasts are ok, good start to the day.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1007,Reasonably priced hotel in a great location,40,February 2017,"The staff here are very helpful and great you every time you arrive and leave the building. Checking in was quick and easy. The rooms are quite roomy with very good amenities. The hotel is in very close proximity to the shops restaurants, beauty salons etc. Their restaurant has some decent food choices.
The pool was quite spacious and clean. The gardens are well manicured and maintained.
The only downside were the lifts as was a bit narrow and constantly smelt of cigarettes.
The hotel was a fantastic price for the 2 nights I stayed. If I were to come back to Seminyak I would stay here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1008,Good location,30,February 2017,"Stayed in for two nights, we checked in very late due to our flight being delayed but the check in process was still very quick and a porter took us to our room and explained the room to us.
We had a room that was on the ground floor and the balcony walked straight out to the pool which was really handy. We had breakfast there once and was a good variety of food and was delicious. Was close to a lot of restaurants and shops and wasn't too far away from Seminyak Square.
The rooms do look a bit out dated but they were still good either way. Would stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1009,Atmoshere,50,February 2017,"After arriving from Ubud along conjested roads this place is a santuary. Staff from the checkin to restaurant made the holiday with such friendly greetings. We were upgraded to the suites in the second block which is more tranquil and has its own breakfast area. Breakfast selection is generous, with personally cooked eggs and Capucinno coffee not drip! An easy 15 minute walk to the beach and many restaurants and bars to choose from. Stayed 5 nights and intend booking this hotel again",The Haven Bali Seminyak

After being fetched at Ngurah Rai, we recently stayed for 6 nights in a spacious 1-bedroom suite fitted out with a super comfy bed with spacious ambience, two private balconies with beautiful views out over the tropical gardens and swimming pools and an oversized daybed on the balcony. The use of the bathroom, which need some maintenance (it took a long time for the water to flow away), was problematic for older people, because of the high entry level in the bathtub / shower, in case a shower was taken. But the staff solved this problem in an excellent way by providing us with an additional small stair.
Our suite, located at the back end of the resort, was a long walk from the main lobby on the one hand but offered much privacy on the other. This led to a situation that many guests from the hotel sought rest in the pools between the suites.
There was fortunately another lobby at that end, much closer for us and accessible to a side street off Jalan Double Six. Breakfast was great with a good variety of different cuisines to choose from.
The service at The Haven was perfect, the staff was very helpful and could not do enough for you; a high level of customer service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1011,Wedanniv getaway,40,February 2017,"Spent 3 nights here. Overall is good stay. We requested to upgrade the room because we felt the room that we booked was so small. We paid additional cost to move to studio room. It will be better though if they offered us complimentary upgrade for our special occasion, but we get reasonable price for the upgrade itself.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1012,Only went for breakfast,50,February 2017,"Great buffet breakfast, we stayed at a nearby villa and went here for breakfast each day
Great coffee fresh made and not Bali coffee, great value.
Really good unlimited buffet for only 115,000rp per person",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1013,Favourite Hotel in Seminyak,50,November 2016,"We love The Haven and go every April as a family and sometimes in November as a couple. We stay in the 1 bedroom pool villa which is very spacious and amazing. Staff are beautifully people. The Sabeen restaurant serves amazing food and Made Nuraska serves the best drinks, he has also become our friend! We love the luxury of the pool villa but the also that we are in a beautiful hotel with all the facilities eg: 2 main pools, 2 restaurants, room service, security etc. Location is awesome and close to everything Bintang supermarket is a 5 minute walk away.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1014,Great find,50,February 2017,"Stayed here for 5 nights as a group of friends travelling. Stayed in a two bedroom suite at the back end of the hotel which was amazing.
Check in process was a little slow and the room ready just after 3pm, however it is Bali so you can let these little things slide. A porter helped us with our luggage right to our room and explained hotel facilities and the back exit which is close to the beach which was a nice touch.
Wifi didn't work one day after a lot of rain but staff were very apologetic and it didn't end up being a major issue.
Definitely recommend staying here and will return!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1015,Good Hotel,40,February 2017,"It was a good location, great breakfast, but very touristy area! It's hard to bargain with the local shops because they get so much business. Great local restaurants. Easy to get taxis and when you go to local restaurants, some places will tell you about good prices on tours. Can be a little loud at night because across the street there is a bar with loud music and only complaint I have about the room is that there was only 2 plugs (one in the bathroom and the other in the room).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1016,Great central location,40,December 2016,"We stayed here for 3 nights in December in a one bedroom suite. The suite was a good size and modern with a super comfy bed and pillows. Our suite was located at the back section of the property, which was a long walk from the main lobby, but we soon discovered there was another lobby at that end of the hotel which was much closer and accessible from a side street off the main double six street.
Breakfast was lovely and there was a good variety of different cuisines to choose from.
The staff were all lovely and very helpful, a high level of customer service.
Our only issue was with the bathtub/shower. It would fill up while having a shower (no the plug wasn't in) and take a long time to drain. There was also a leek from the room above that when it rained, dripped into my suitcase.
A bit of maintenance needed here and there, but overall a lovely place to stay with 2 nice pools and nice gardens.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1017,"''Comfortable""",40,February 2017,"First time at this hotel.Stayed one night . After a long day tour ,i was glad to settle in a very comfortable hotel with all ameneties.Ordered room service for dinner. It was quick and prices very reasonable. Honest staff , forgot some chocolates in the fridge they were quick to catch me before i got into the cab to leave for the airport. Thank you. Will stay in this hotel again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1018,Comfortable in animated area,40,February 2017,"Stayed one night in suite with small bacony overlooking nice pool.Nice modern room and bathroom but in need of upkeeping(doors of furniture do not close properly,mirors needing repair) but good bedding and linen and excellent staff service.At first desapointed with check-in since we arrived at noon and room ready only at 3hres20pm but seems check-in is late at this hotel since it's at 3 hres pm.Room needs better cleaning and furniture upgrade to meet a higher standard.Ok for one night.Hotel situated in animated town of Seminyak so a lot of shopping and restaurants around,very big buzy clean beach at 10 minute walk,never found the Haven Beach Club but enjoyed a light snack at the vip lounge in afternoon tea time.Also had room service Vietname rolls gastronomic!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1019,Great hotel,40,May 2016,This hotel is in a perfect location. Breakfast was good and the pool and bar are fantastic. The staff are very friendly and professional. The bar has a great night life atmosphere. Highly recommend the hotel.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1020,Great Hotel,50,February 2017,"Stayed here with my partner after travelling through Asia for a few weeks. Spent a week here in a suite and it was amazing. Very modern and comfortable, great balcony overlooking pools. Staff very friendly and welcoming all the time. Pretty reasonably priced. Walking distance to beach and surrounding restaurants. Very upmarket sort of area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1021,Nice relaxing stay,40,February 2017,"This was my first time to this hotel and it was only a short 3 night stay in a ""Haven Room"", but it was very good. The breakfast each day offered a good variety and the pricing at the hotel's restaurant was on par with other establishments around the area.

We were staying with our 9 month old infant and requested a baby cot, when we arrived it was very nicely set up in our room with rugs, a couple of guling pillows and a stuffed toy, it was very nicely done.

The pool is good but it is down stairs from the room we were in, and because we had a pram we had to use the lift and take quite a walk to get there. If we didn't have a pram it would have been much quicker to walk straight down the stairs from reception.

The location is OK but not fantastic, it's about a 400m walk from the Bintang supermarket but there's not as many traditional market shops around close to the hotel compared to if you were staying in central Kuta. This can be a good thing though, because it's not as busy around the area.

The staff were friendly and nothing we requested during our stay was an issue.

I look forward to staying here again in the future.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1022,Excellent service and delightful place,50,February 2017,Great place at the heart of Seminyak that is a hidden gem. Service from every staff was warm made it feel like a second home. Rooms were modern and bathroom had a bigger than usual bathtub with hot water and good pressure. Highly recommended!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1023,Pleasant holiday experience.,40,January 2017,"I stayed at Haven hotel for one week. During this time I only had positive experiences. Nicely maintained infrastructure, tidy rooms, nice gym . At Sabeen restaurant delicious food is served.. The suites are truly spacious and luxurious, the staff is extremely friendly and always willing to meet your demands.
With special thanks to Ms. Nita who put extra effort in making my stay even more enjoyable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1024,Great Hospitality at The Haven Hotel - Seminyak,50,February 2017,"All the staff at the Haven are very friendly, knowledgeable and professional.

Dayu, Guest Relations Officer at Reception, in particular was most helpful in organizing my booking and transport. She is a great asset to the Hotel.

Housekeeping was excellent.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1025,Beautiful hotel with a few problems,30,January 2017,"I recently stayed in a suite here for 5 nights with some friends of mine. The hotel scenery is absolutely beautiful with all of the fountains, ponds and pools. The trees give it a nice atmosphere too. The staff were extremely attentive and polite. The restaurants offered a nice variety of choices during the day. The location is nice, not too far from the airport and lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. The beach is a 10 minute walk. The spa was also amazing, I did the ultimate 3 hour package and felt so relaxed and comfortable the whole time for such a low price.

The suite itself was really spacious and comfortable, however we had a few problems. First, we had a leak from the ceiling in our bedroom and bathroom. We called the front desk about it, but whatever they did didn't work because rain water continued to leak through during our stay, leaving messes on the floors. The floors also had ants. Our bathrom smelled, particulary near the toilet. It could have been from the water dripping down. A few times we would enter our room only to have the electricity shut off right after. They came to fix it pretty quickly, but the fix didn't seem to last long.

My friend and I who were staying in a suite weren't allowed to eat breakfast with our friend who was staying in one of the regular rooms. They told her it would cost extra to eat in the restaurant closest to us, which doesn't make any sense. Both rooms had breakfast included in our stay so why does it matter which restaurant we eat in?",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1026,Holidays,50,January 2017,"Had a great time being with The Haven. Amazing working stuff and the hotel itself of course.
Gym, swimming pool 👌
Good location if you want to stay at the centre and just walk down to the shopping road of seminyak.
Was really satisfied staying with Haven. They have a hotel room, suits, villa rooms! Its really big hotel and beautiful build!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1027,Great stay,40,February 2017,"Reasonable price..clean room,great service and good food. Quite near the beach as well.The service is fast n good.Trust me you will be greeted by every staf which feels so welcoming.The only thing was the wifi in the room was so weak that i had to keep changing places to get a connection but it all good..don miss out the breakfast, so many choice and the best part is they have a live waffle station always the best..Keep it up and will def tell my friends back home abt this hotel..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1028,BEAUTIFUL RESORT SHORT WALK TO DOUBLE SIX BEACH,50,June 2016,"FANTASTIC STAFF, FANTASTIC ROOM, GREAT FACILITIES.

We had a great time here and loved the location near double six beach which has loads of bars and surf schools. short drive to the main area with restaurants etc also",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1029,"Great location, friendly Staff",40,January 2017,"If you want great location this is the place to be massage, shop, restaurant just around the corner, but going to Seminyak Legian beach must catch a shuttle bus. We had 1 bedroom suite and If you like cooking this is the better deal as it come with the big kitchen. The room design is nice but the room itself needs a refurbished. They have nice pool, reasonable gym but took 6 days to provide exercise mat. The good thing about Haven hotel the staff are very friendly and you can feel their sincere greetings to guess, which I like the most of this hotel, and that's the reason that I will come back again in Haven in my next holiday in Bali.

Just a quick tip for new comers in Bali, always ask for blue bird taxi as they use meter & more honest driver, and the rest are rip off, always negotiate the price first before you get in the taxi......

Use big money changer instead of small one, because the small one might be higher exchange rate but they are always trying to play tricks on you.

Please be generous giving tips to hotel staff and to the people who were doing massage as they get pay peanuts.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1030,"Great location, excellant staff",40,January 2017,Stayed here for 10 days with family. Four rooms altogether (two double suites & two hotel rooms). Fantastic location basically on the boarder of Seminyak and Legian. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Only downside is the place is staring to look a little tired. would we stay again - Probably.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1031,Comfy Hotel,40,January 2017,"The hotel location is strategic, about 1km walking distance to the nearest beach. The room is comfortable, suitable for business and leisure, but not so romantic for honeymooners. The breakfast was yummy, but the receptionist was not very friendly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1032,Amazing!,50,January 2017,"Me and my partner just spent a week at The Haven and didn't want to leave! The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was delicious every day. Our room was great and housekeeping did a fab job every day. Great location too.
Our friend even checked out from her hotel early to stay there with us! We'd happily stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1033,Haven of relaxation,40,January 2017,"This hotel lives up to its name as a haven of relaxation. We had a poolside room away from the main road, so it was very peaceful. There are a few pools in the hotel and we were lucky enough to be beside the quietest. The sun loungers / day beds were so comfy. I particularly liked the policy that towels were removed from sun loungers after 30 minutes of non use, meaning you could always find a spot to sit.

Food was reasonably priced and tasted very good. I saw a group doing a cookery class which looked great fun.

The rooms were very plush with a huge bathroom. Bathrobes, slippers and a large selection of toiletries were provided. The bed was very comfortable.

The gym was excellent. It had modern equipment and everything worked well.

For us, we didn't find a lot to do in the area around the hotel. It is situated in the main shopping area and there is heavy traffic. However, there is someone outside to assist you in crossing the road.

Would fully recommend if you are looking for relaxation or shopping in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1034,fabulous,50,January 2017,A very pleasant hotel with lovely staff. Two of us stayed in the classic room overlooking the pool.. It was big enough and a good size balcony. The hotel is in a great location. A great breakfast is served at the restaurant overlooking the street and beautiful water features. The only negative I had was the lighting in the bathroom was too dim otherwise all was perfect.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1035,They have Evacuation plan for tsunami 😂 👍 and they have villas with private swimming pool,50,January 2017,"One of best hotel in Bali in legian area
Good location
Good services
Good breakfast
They have room, suits, villas. And there us two entrance from main street and from small St in back choose what nearest to your room
I stay at suit room and was so nice but need better AC coz the room is big.
I will recommend for my friends for sure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1036,Great Hotel and location,40,January 2017,"I think this hotel would be great for couples and solo traveler. Breakfast is standard in variety, the hotel provide local cuisine for dinner once a week. the room cleanliness and hospitality are great. The bathroom is made of glass wall, if you don't mind then this hotel is prefect for you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1037,Great Hotel!,50,January 2017,"The Haven was great for our stay this January, we spent 4 nights here and were very happy with our room and service we received. The one bedroom suite that we stayed in was spacious, comfortable and clean. The hotel has 2 main pools for use which are great and the buffet breakfast was delicious with pancakes, waffles and eggs on request. The restaurant at the front of the hotel provided delicious cocktails and pizzas. Highly recommend!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1038,Great hotel and great location,50,February 2016,"This was a really great place to stay. We had such a good time and were really relaxed. The breakfast is awesome and the suite rooms are so big!! we had 3 persons in the one bedroom suite. The staff were super friendly, and we really appreciated Ria's help in settling us in and preparing fun activities for us",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1039,Friendly staff and Great hotel,50,January 2017,"I fell comfort at the Haven in Bali, start from arriving till departure all staff were friendly and always shown help. They have 3 diferrent concept of Room. The building in front was called Haven room, in the middle was Haven Villa and the building in the back they called Haven suite. The atmosphere was great, natural ambience. If you stay at the back mean suite room, this will help you to stay healhty by walking should you go to front desk and resto. I WANT TO STAY AGAIN AT THE HAVEN.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1040,Holiday,40,January 2017,Nice hotel with good Price. Cosy stay and good location. Welcome drink was nice and breakfast menu variety was a lot and changes daily. The massage was ok but it can be better. Reasonable price.. ok to visit again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1041,Great stay,40,January 2017,"Arrived at the Haven at 12noon knowing fully that our room may not be ready until 3pm. But was pleasantly surprised when we were able to check in early. Checkin was smooth, efficient & staff very friendly. Stayed in a two bedroom suite on ground floor overlooking the pool. Lovely and roomy for our family of 5. The suite was clean & spacious with a central living area. Each room had a flat screen tv & a balcony overlooking the pool. There was also a dvd/cd player & a full sized fridge. The suites are at the back of this hotel which is good as less noise & very private. There is also an entrance/reception at the back of the hotel which is handy and takes you out to Double Six street which takes you down to the beach. Breakfast selection was good with egg/waffle station & usual offerings. Was able to order latte/cappucino which was a bonus & tasted like real coffee. The aircon worked perfectly & wifii was fast. Pool was a little shaded and the water a quiet cold but refreshing in the humid climate. We checked out at 4:30am & received take awsy breakfast boxes which was a nice touch. Overall a very pleasant stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1042,Great Place ..,40,December 2016,"It was a great stay a The Haven, the location is very close to Kuta as well. we stayed in a 02 bedroom suite. the rooms were quite spacious and so was the living area. but was quite a walk to the suite and at times of rain, you have no complete indoor access to the rooms as such would need to get wet. the AC was not upto the expectations but since it was raining during the period of our stay( 16th to 20th of December 2016) it was not felt too much but would certainly matter during warmer periods of the year.

The buffet was average and so was the room service menu. pricing on the high side. service overall was good and the spa was amazing..

Despite the few areas of concern, overall it was a pleasant stay and will return again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1043,Friendly service,40,January 2017,"We stayed at The Haven for two weeks in January 2017. The rooms were comfortable although fairly small. Unfortunately the room overlooked the main swimming pool which was very popular with children who loudly invaded it from dawn to dusk (but that is not the hotel's fault). The rooms were serviced daily and our housekeeping attendant 'Edi' was a delight and extremely courteous. The service in the restaurant was slow at times but once again the staff were always very pleasant. The hotel is situated in a great area of Seminyak only a ten minute stroll to the beach and a five dollar (AU) taxi ride to some of the popular restaurants such as La Lucciola and Potato Head.

The only complaint that we have about The Haven is its WiFi connection. This was extremely slow most of the time and kept fading in and out. When we enquired at reception if there was a problem, the receptionist checked her mobile phone and said 'mine is working'. At the time we complained there were two other guests at reception complaining about the same thing, so we can only assume it is/was a systemic problem.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1044,Definitely book a suite!!,40,October 2016,"Had a lovely few days here - it was my first trip to Bali and I finished up my trip with my last 4 nights here.

Booked a 1 bedroom suite - which was great - large and very comfortable. Loved the pool near the suites. Particularly the double size sun beds - magical.

Hotel was convenient to restaurants and for my first stay in Bali, it was ideal.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1045,Fantastic Service by staff and great value for money close to everything,50,October 2016,We stay in the 2 bedroom suite on most stays at this hotel. Housekeeping is of a very high standard. Gardens are beautiful. Nice swimming pools. Good food in Restaurants and room service. Breakfast has great selection. Also when you stay in Suits you get daily afternoon tea and drinks in the lounge and free shuttle to the beach club. The staff go of of their way to make you feel special especially Dayu she is amazing,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1046,Wonderful villa,50,July 2016,"Stayed at Haven for a week with family. We had two villas and one couple in a suite. We all loved our time there. Beautiful accommodation . Villas are magnificent with private pool. Great buffet breakfast and friendly attentive staff. I make special mention of Dayu in Guest Relations. She looked after us and attended to all our needs. Dayu is one of the most efficient and nicest people we have met in Bali - we have been to Bali at least 10 times. The Haven is in a great location, close to restaurants. They have a shuttle service to the beach. Thoroughly recommended for couples and groups of friends. We are going back In March and cannot wait.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1047,Great place to stay.,40,October 2016,"I stayed here for a total of about 9 nights all up and found it to be a nice place to stay. Rooms were spacious and always kept clean and made up everyday by the staff.
I had the buffet breakfast every morning and found it pretty good and plentiful.
The location was good right near shops and restaurants and about a 10 minute walk to the beach
The pool was nice and relaxing bit a few more lounges to sit in would have been good.
I also requested to change rooms when I checked in the second time as I wanted to be near the back as its away from the street and its quieter. The request was met with promptly.
All in all I'd recommend staying here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1048,Bali retreat,20,January 2017,"The hotel does not look like wat it claims to be in the picture. It states partial seaview but nowhere can the view be described as partial seaview. The view is of trees and just a glimpse of the shoreline.
The airconditioning is very poor. We set the thermostat at 18degrees but it felt like 28degrees and took so Long for the room to be cold. One day it's too cold and the other night, it's not working. Woke up few times in sweat as it's too hot. 2 ""Engineers"" came and matter was only rectified the next day.
Food selection not great and appetising.
The hotel room needs upgrading. Broken tiles and chipped woods are not exactly what you would expect from a 2 bedroom suite. The bathtub was dirty and it takes quite a while for the water to go down the drain. We actually had to take the stopper out so that the water would flow better. Furnishings could have been better with refurbishing.
Housekeeping came to clean the rooms with their shoes on and just a mop. No vacuum of the place.
Power point plug is the master bedroom is spoilt and there are so few power points.
The pool is small and is always filled with people.
Location is good though as it's within walking distance of what u need.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1049,Day 1 first impressions,20,January 2017,"Checked into 2 bedroom suite today. Here for another 5 nights.

Th staff are friendly, the location is great close to the action.
The grounds look amazing.And Food is good.

Downside, Suite can do with a good clean. Tired and smells.

Final review when we leave on 20/01/17",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1050,Very nice hotel in the center of Seminyak,40,January 2017,"We stayed in a suite. I know the hotel has also smaller rooms and villas. Our suite had a bedroom and a living room with sofa bed and kitchenette and one big balcony, facing the pool area. The studio was slightly outdated but clean, huge, on the fourth (highest) floor and you could get a glimpse of the sea from the balcony. A TV set in each room.

The air conditioners in the suite were very noisy and outdated. As you are given only one key to the suite, the A/C turned off every time you leave, and it then took c. two hours to cool the rooms. But anyway, it was good value for money for this size of the room and location.

The closest entrance to the suites wing is from a quiet side street of Jalan Arjuna, not Jalan Seminyak, which we found slightly confusing.

The buffet breakfast was served in the open restaurant by the suites pool area. It had a good enough choice, including Indonesian dishes, but the taste of the food was not great - rather, it was just ok.

The personnel of the hotel was nice and friendly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1051,Great location!,40,January 2017,"We stayed here for 6 days and found it to be really enjoyable. We were in a ground floor room directly across from one of the swimming pools which was just perfect. At night no one swims so you have the pool to yourself.

The only slight issue we had was the kids waking up early to get into the pool and shout, but if you're an early riser this shouldn't be a problem.

The staff are friendly and always greet you when they go by. The Haven is in such a great location as it's surrounded by many shops and great restaurants and about a ten to fifteen minute walk to the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1052,Genuine customer service,40,January 2017,"Stayed in a one bedroom suite, situated at the back of the complex. The room was spacious and the double balcony overlooking the pool was a nice feature. Having a separate rear lobby and access was a bonus. The one criticism is that the rooms don't come with standard cooking utensils so they're not self sufficient like some apartments (it is possible to request a basic supply).

We found the breakfast average as was the one lunch we had. The location is very good and we had several quality meals within walking distance of our room.

The standout for us though was the customer service, which is evident across all departments of the hotel. Respectful and attentive at all times, special thanks to the housekeeping staff of Agus, Eka and Yasa.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1053,Good location and 10/10 Customer Service,40,January 2017,"I cannot start to compliment the staff that work here - so friendly, helpful and attentive. The customer service really made this resort a standout.

We stayed in a room with pool access which was great breakfast buffet and room service was also delicious. And we met a lot of great guests also

Great location. Will be back soon guys!!

1054,the bathroom smells,20,December 2016,"at first when we arrived, we liked this hotel because it is on a busy street and looks good with a pool in the middle of the property. we have a family room of 2 bedrooms, it seems modern and spacious, but when you actually live there, you will find that the bathroom had no ventilation and its door is directly facing your bed, really smells. We booked and paid for 5 nights, and left after the second night. Would not stand it!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1055,"average hotel, great pools, flies flying around in Sabeen Restaurant",30,January 2017,"I arrived at the hotel by about 0800PM , but the reception said I have to wait a while as my room wasn't ready as some guests had extended stay till 0700PM. I said to him didn't you have another room , as this is 0800PM and still no 1 ready room ?
The Haven room is so standard, I got my room on the 4th floor by the edge. I noticed that the room has no double lock key room, I think this is not common at such 4 stars hotel.
Breakfast is average, open air Sabeen Restaurant, many flies flying around on our dishes, very unfortunate.
I love its pools, you can swim in the shade of trees and plans. Another advantage is every room has its balcony, nice.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1056,Great location and spacious suite,50,January 2017,"We stayed in 2 bedroom suite for 3 nights. We are family of 5. The 2 bedroom suite are very spacious, comfy and clean. We had 3 balconies including a large day bed on one, with amazing views of the pool and garden. Our kids enjoyed the pool and breakfast was good.
The location is great, walking distance to plenty of restaurants, shops, spas and double six beach. They provide beach shuttle every 2 hours to their beach club.
The staff were very friendly and helpful, Thank you Ms. Ernita for your kindness.
The suite was perfect for family.
Highly recommend this hotel !!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1057,Spacious rooms and great pools,30,November 2016,"The stay was good with the accommodation being very spacious and well air-conditioned. The Breakfast was limited in selection so pretty much having the same thing everyday. Lunch time we were there twice and was hassled by bees coming into the restaurant and flying around the table. The restaurant is fairly open and the staff couldn't do much but it was annoying. They have their own beauty therapy (ATMA Spa) but I must admit the massage I got I did wake up the next day with a stiff neck. The pools are beautiful. The staff are very friendly and very accommodating on request and inquiries. I must warn travelers beware on the ATM on the streets. I did get skimmed and lost 2k which the bank returned after 3 weeks, The locals are friendly but also beware.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1058,Ask for a room away from the street!,30,December 2016,"Stayed here over New Years eve. Rooms are the standard hotel quality. We were allocated a room that was on level 1, right above the main street.

Ask for a room which is not by the street, as the rooms aren't sound proofed so you will hear everything! New Years eve was expectedly loud (that's okay though, as we came home pretty late and were tired). However, the next morning you could hear every honk and shouting from the street. Luckily we were moved to a quieter room for the next two nights.

The Haven do have rooms that are farther away from the street that are pretty nice, such as their ""studio"" rooms, which we got to experience as they upgraded us. The upgrade was not as a result of complaining about the noise, rather, we had requested a double/queen bed and were given two single beds. They were fully booked out for New Years Eve, and then the next day did not have any standard rooms with queen beds available so they reluctantly gave us an upgrade (as I was advised on the phone - that they had no choice!).

As you can tell, the service provided in my experience was mediocre, and not as friendly as the typical Balinese service we experienced elsewhere. Probably won't stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1059,Good,40,January 2017,"I stayed three nights with family in 2 Bedroom Suites, Room 0101 and 0102. The room was very spacious, but the smell of the wood in both rooms quite disturbing.
View to garden and garden is nice, and balcony is so comfort. Very good...
The breakfast is quite varied and tasty. The process of check in and check out quickly and simplel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1060,Good value for money,40,April 2016,"My girlfriend and I stayed at The Haven Bali in April 2016. The staff were welcoming and polite and the Haven first floor room we stayed in was spacious with a large separate bathroom and toilet. Rooms also have a balcony facing one of the two swimming pools which provides a lovely view. The resort is in a good location on the main street and has good access to shops, restaurants and a Bintang supermarket close by. The beach is about 15 mins walk with an array of restaurants and shops on the way or you can use the free shuttle bus from the resort to get to the beach which runs every few hours. Overall it's a good value for money resort and the breakfast has a good Indonesian Buffett selection as well as an egg station and a waffle station. They did have some problems with the air conditioning in the rooms whilst we were there as it was not cooling to the desired temperature but were always prompt in getting the service man out to have a look at it fairly promptly. Not sure that the problem was totally rectified as it seemed to work on and off as did the WI-FI but for most of the time it was O.K.
One of the guests we met whilst we were there was staying in a suite room toward the back of the resort which was larger and more well appointed than ours and she had no air conditioning or WI-FI problems in her room so it may be worth paying a little extra for a suite room on our next stay at The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1061,Lovely pool quite noisy,30,March 2016,Stayed here in between work. Beautiful pool which is peaceful. Rooms are very spacious with a nice shower. I had a room near reception area as it is all open planned i found it quite noisy especially when they had the live singer who was very good. Found breakfast quite poor wasn't topped up enough and not a lot of choice.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1062,A good value hotel,40,December 2016,We stayed in the 1 bedroom suite hotel. A good and decent hotel. Clean and tidy. But the hotel discourage using Uber and Grab as a transportation. Breakfast was very limited for the class of hotel. Not much of varieties for the breakfast.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1063,Courteous staffs,40,December 2016,Stayed 3 nights and staffs were friendly and accommodating. Room shown its aged but still well maintained. Bathroom kept clean with plenty of amenities and the good thing the room still has balcony for you to enjoy the air/views. Breakfast surprisingly good for the size of the hotel with plenty of local/westerners options. Location is another highlight as located in the center of Seminyak. 24hrs stores located opposite and next to the hotel and plenty of cafes/restaurants to enjoy.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1064,Good value for money,50,December 2016,"Rooms are spacious and all the rooms have a balcony facing the swimming pool that provides a good view. Good location on main street having boutique to branded shops. Beach is 15 mins walk with various restaurants on the way. Good value for money.

Breakfast spread is good, but has Indonesian touch.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1065,Fantastic location in Seminyak,40,December 2016,"Breezy and well kept hotel right in the center of Seminyak. Well maintained and comfortable spacious rooms. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite by the pool, everything's great except for the noise made by the breakfast crowd as our room (No:911) was right by the restaurant. We weren't affected that much as we were already awake by 7am, if you prefer a quieter location, ask for rooms 906-909 or 916-919. Good breakfast spread with great service. Lots of shops and eateries around the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1066,Nice hotel but could be so much better,30,December 2016,"This was our first trip to Bali so I wanted to stay in a mid range hotel so I could be reasonably sure we'd be comfortable. The Haven was recommended to me so that made my mind up for me.
The hotel is lovely, with a lovely setting and well positioned in Seminyak. The rooms were bright and clean with a good sized balcony. We were very comfortable.
The breakfast was included and was a good buffet with many choices available including an egg station and a waffle/pancake station. We filled up every morning and loved it!
The staff, like everyone in Bali, were incredibly friendly. They all made a fuss of our children and they seemed to genuinely love kids. Twice when we got back to our room after it had been made up they had left towel models on our bed, one of a dog wearing my daughter's hat and sunglasses. The kids loved it.
There are two swimming pools which are fairly large and well maintained. One end of one of the pools is very shallow and was great for our 3 year old to splash in.
So, how could it be better? In my opinion the hotel is not very well managed. At breakfast there were a lot of staff, but we had to keep asking for coffee or even just to get cutlery. The staff serving were super friendly, but seemed to be lacking management.
At the pool one day a guy came to try to sell us poolside drinks, promoting a 2 for 1 offer on mojitos. I agreed and when he bought them I asked to sign them to my room. He disappeared then came back and said we couldn't because we hadn't arranged that facility with reception (first hotel I've been to where you can't sign to your room). I gave cash and then they didn't have change. I wished I hadn't bothered with the drinks he was trying to sell me. Again, poor management I think.
There were other small annoyances, like having to sign poolside towels in and out. I wouldn't expect to do this in a decent hotel.
We were given free welcome drinks vouchers, so went down to the bar for a beer/cocktail only to be told it was soft drinks only. I'd rather they didn't give me the voucher, or state on the voucher it's for soft drinks only. And Bintang is so cheap why not allow a free beer!
I think the Haven is a nice hotel, but it is relatively expensive for Bali and for that reason I expected a bit more.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1067,Value for money and well-located,40,December 2016,"Nice and clean rooms. Courteous staff. A small gym and nice swimming pool. Sumptuous breakfast, but cleanliness standards need to be upped. Access to the beach from within hotel. Well placed with lots of spas and shops around. Decent wifi and tie up with good tour operators",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1068,Pleasant stay!,40,December 2016,"I think it is my 3rd time staying at this hotel. The staff is very friendly - every where you met them, they will greet you.

The breakfast was also great. My room has been upgraded to suite.

The team at the front desk is really helpful and want to ensure that we enjoy our stay at Haven. Thanks!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1069,My son loves the pool!,40,December 2016,"We stayed here for two nights and overall we were very happy! We had a Haven room on the ground floor, right in front of the hotel's pool. Though it's not big, but it has kids pool area, and a basketball ring. A small kids playground with only one slide is also available by the pool area.

There are two more pools on the back area of the hotel. Another small to mid sized adult pool and bigger kids pool! Really loves it!

The room smells a bit mouldy when we get in for the first time but no more since we often open the balcony door.

They have a dedicated beach club a shuttle bus away but unfortunately we didn't get the chance to use it.

Oh, they need to improve the taste for breakfast menu. Most of it were bland for my Indonesian tastebud.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1070,Family trip 20th Dec to 24 Dec,30,December 2016,"Based on the reviews it seemed to be good hotel. We booked 2 bedroom suite for our family of 5 .Our flight was early and we reached the hotel around 10am.
The reception was good enough to let us hv a room at 1pm. The property seem abit old and slightly dirty, the floor near the bathrooms were cracked and stained. we asked for a change of rooms, they offered another but almost the same condition. we decided to remain in the room. When we had a shower the problem started . The water leaked thru to the bedroom. Approached the reception for change of room , initally they didnt hv rooms. I offered to pay for an upgrade to the villas but their prices is very expensive. Finally they assured us they will hv a room available by end of the day. On our return we had a better room. Except for this incident the rest was a pleasant experience.
- Ground floor suites facing the pool is nice. At night with the light it was serene and beautiful.
- restaurant/Sabeen - Ms Lily - her service was excellent - very attentive and made our dining enjoyable.
- restaurant /Cello (near the suites) Ms Riyani - she attended us for our breakfast. very pleasant, attentive and a good start for our day.
- Spa - compared to other spas, its avearage.
- Breakfast - standard breakfast , its was the same for the 4 days we stayed there.
Overall the staff all over the hotel were polite and courteous. whenever you see them , they always greet you with a smile.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1071,Good value of money,30,December 2016,"If you look for a hotel that is just walking distance from everywhere this is the place.
This hotel is closer to legian than seminyak. So if you want to hang out to seminyak you still have to take a taxi.
They provide shuttle bus to the beach club every 2 hours.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1072,Great place,50,December 2016,Bit more upmarket than I'm used to. Even though it's on the main road and about a 10 minute walk to the beach it is quiet and laid back. A great pool area and a range of rooms. The room was comfortable but they do lack drawers to put your clothes in. Plenty of choice for breakfast with western and Indonesian food. Not as hectic as Kuta or Legian.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1073,Be Very Careful,20,December 2016,"This place is a nice quiet spot with two OK pools. Bit far from stuff. Closer to Kuta than Seminyak.

I had a major issue: my wife and son suddenly couldn't travel with me to Bali, so I went solo for a few days, as was meeting a good mate there, whose backpacking trip we had orchestrated to coincide with our family holiday.

The Haven refused to give us a refund on any of the NINE NIGHTS we had booked there. I had thought they might charge for one or two nights and refund the rest, as is standard practice. They gave us nothing.

When it transpired I would be on my own, I had at this stage planned to stay elsewhere in Seminyak, since, without the family in tow, I didn't need a lovely big suite all to myself (and they are beautiful rooms, to be fair). But I thought, screw it, if they weren't going to refund me ANY MONEY, I'd just use the suite at The Haven for the three nights I was in town.

The day I went to check out, they expressed their surprise, as I wasn't meant to be leaving for the best part of a week (this was in spite of me telling them when I checked in that my trip would be cut short). But I told them I simply wasn't able to stay and that I'd like to leave. What they did next was simply insulting.

The receptionist printed off a pro forma declaration for me to sign, stating that I couldn't stay for ""personal reasons"" and that I wouldn't look for a refund on any part of my stay. Is this the same hotel which blankly refused to refund any part of my stay regardless? Was the point of making me sign that declaration solely to ensure I would write a poor review on this website? Ridiculous. I wish I had had the presence of mind to tear it up and throw back at them. It still rankles.

In summary, The Haven is probably a good spot for a family holiday, but book at your peril.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1074,SUPERB!!,50,July 2016,"perfect hotel!!

1075,Good hotel but less in cleanliness,30,December 2016,"Overall this is a good hotel with good location. Hotel have unique swimming pool and unique restaurant. But, there was some flies flying in restaurant that make me felt disgusted to eat. The bed sheet also not too clean.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1076,Loved it,50,December 2016,"The haven was great, room was large and well maintained. Buffet breakfast exceeded my expectations great range of delicious food. Close to the beach and shops. Short cab ride away from the center of seminyak.
Highly recommend the haven hotel, I plan on returning on my next trip to Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1077,Perfect start to our Bali trip!,50,December 2016,"We arrived in the evening after a couple of long flights from the UK. We felt extremely welcome from the moment we checked in right through to when we checked out. The rooms were great, the staff couldn't do enough for you and were very helpful when we wanted to visit areas outside of Seminyak.

The airport is only 30 minutes or so away, the beach is a short walk and local shops and restaurants aren't far either.

For our first 3 nights in Bali it couldn't have been any better. If you're looking to relax by the beach, do a little shopping, eat at great restaurants and have the option to visit other sights at a great price, this is your place!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1078,Great service & location,40,December 2016,"We stayed at the haven suite room for 4 nights and we were pleased with the service. The rooms are large and decent.
Unfortunately one of the robes was a bit dirty and the bed had hair but it was off putting. The hotel manager attended to it straight away.
Our son stepped on a sewing needle that was in the rug which was unfortunate. In the hotels defence, the needle would not have been found even in your own home so it wasn't due to the place not being vacuum properly.
The nurse was called and the doctor just in case it was anything serious. The hotel manager came and checked he was ok and called the next day also. Even though it wasn't pleasant, we were very happy with their attentive service.

There are two pool areas and a kids pool also.

The venue it's self is nice and the room attendants are fantastic. We were pleasantly surprised with our towels being folded into different animals each night and because we were so happy with the first one, they made lots of different ones on our last day. Our son loves them! Thank you especially to Arta, wijaya & Juli :)

The location is great as you can walk everywhere. It's very central to the beach and great restaurants, cafe and bar.

The hotel is great value and great for families.

The breakfast has a good Buffett selection.

We would definitely recommend the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1079,Outstanding Hotel,50,December 2016,This was my third stay at The Haven and I enjoyed every aspect. The Haven is a beautiful sanctuary in busy Seminyak - this stay I was accommodated in a Junior Suite which was fabulous. The room was spotlessly clean and furnishings really lovely. Every comfort has been catered for. The pool areas are stunning and one could quite easily spend all day relaxing there. What makes The Haven very special are the staff - some of the most delightful and friendly I have ever encountered. Thank you to the Management and Staff for a perfect stay.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1080,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,40,December 2016,Located just between seminyak and Kuta! All the staffs are very friendly. The hotel room is bigger then I expected and with a balcony! The room is facing the pool and probably the best when they had band performing at night as I can hear it from my room (free live music who doesn't like right?) Should definitely try their traditional facial spa 👍🏻,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1081,Great hotel in a handy spot of Seminyak,40,October 2016,"Rooms ok for a short stay. I feel there are much nicer places to stay in Seminyak but this hotel is ok for somewhere to rest your head.
Restaurant is really nice with that said. Breakfast is just a great range and well set out.
The villas in the newer part of the hotel are nicer than those at the front.
We would definately re-book but as mentioned would try for the newer area of the hotel. Our room was a little run-down and tired looking. Shower head was loose and the doors to the balcony would not shut properly or lock.
I had to say the glass door to the en-suite was odd. As a couple we are close...but not THAT close if you know what I mean!
we found the room small but was ok for a short stay.
Great pool area and bar.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1082,Average hotel at convenient location,30,November 2016,"Nice that staff upgraded me to a suite at a quiet corner of the hotel. However, the suite appeared to be slightly run-down in terms of the interior furnishing. Overall, room still considered as comfortable. Pool is acceptable, but can be better. Breakfast was disappointing. lack variety and quality.

Convenient location. near supermarket and restaurants.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1083,Beautiful and relaxing,50,November 2016,"Currently staying here and am absolutely thrilled with everything so far...

Excellent location close to Legian, Seminyak and the beach... easy access to everything.... shopping, restaurants, supermarket...

The staff here are absolutely super friendly and offer warm Balinese welcomes with every interaction...

Rooms are extremely spacious and well maintained, very luxurious; you will be very pleased...

Pools are great, nice and fresh with plenty of lounges to chillax on...

Buffet breakfast is included and you have two great options to choose from...

They also serve a good afternoon tea daily in the club lounge where you can relax prior to going out for dinner....

Very happy here at The Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1084,Adequate for 1 night but wasn't impressed otherwise,30,November 2016,"My brother and I stayed here for 1 night as we really just needed a place to rest our heads as our flight landed in the evening and we'd be heading to Ubud the next day. We didn't want to spend a considerable amount of money for the nice resort we were staying at when we wouldn't fully get to enjoy it the first night.

The Haven Seminyak fit the bill nicely, as it was very reasonably priced (we paid the equivalent of $48 USD total including taxes via Expedia). It's located along one of the primary streets in Seminyak which means it has a great location to restaurants and shops nearby, but also has insane amounts of traffic in front of it as is typically the case with Seminyak these days. Fortunately, the rooms are set far back from the road so you don't really hear any noise from the street.

Check-in was quick and efficient and initial first impressions were positive. We were given a room on the ground floor which meant we had a porch that opened up to the walkway and pool. I would highly recommend avoiding the ground floor rooms, as there was an insane amount of foot traffic on the walkway outside early the next morning and you could hear EVERYTHING. The doors here were paper thin so if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs.

The room was nicely appointed but basic furnishings that weren't over-the-top or terribly luxurious. The room had a musty smell to it though as the aircon hadn't been turned on prior to arrival. The musty smell went away some after we ran the aircon but was still there enough to annoy us. There was also a very unpleasant and weird smell coming from the bathroom and drain.

The craftsmanship of the finishings/installation wasn't very good in my opinion. Some of the sockets and light switches were loose, a light was blown out in the corridor near the door and safety box in our room as well. Interestingly enough, when we were checking in, another guest came to the front desk to complain that his roof was leaking and made a motion with his hands that made it sound like the roof had caved in a bit. Staff seemed unsure how to handle it and it had me wondering what I might be in for craftsmanship wise. Nobody wants to hear that when they first get to a hotel!

Beds here were decent but the pillows absolutely sucked and were way too hard; hence I didn't have a great nights rest.

Perhaps one of the most annoying things about this hotel though is the taxi / car drivers at a desk they have just opposite the lobby that you have to pass to exit the hotel (and from what I could tell this was the ONLY way to get out of the hotel).

They were terribly annoying and always tried to hawk their taxi / car services every time we walked by. I don't think they were part of the hotel but were allowed to be there by the hotel though. Even just waiting for our driver out front they were nosey and wouldn't bugger off and mind their own business.

This alone is a reason to avoid a hotel in my book; nobody wants to get haggled EVERY SINGLE FREAKING TIME they walk past a desk that is unavoidable to walk past to get in and out of the building.

Would I stay at The Haven again? Probably not, there are many other places in Bali to experience and explore, especially in Seminyak.

Was it adequate for just a night? Yes, though lets just say we were glad to leave.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1085,What service is supposed to be like.,50,November 2016,"Let me start by saying that this is not our first stay at The Haven.
Only rated at 3-4 star we were expecting the basics, well what a pleasant surprise.
The hotel staff seemed to be everywhere waiting for their next assignment.
The Haven has three resturants and swim up bar. Its own spa on site. The food is fantastic, and make sure you prebook the breakfast package. The staff will also prepare a picnic lunch if requested.
There are nightly music events with local and overseas guests. The Haven is clean tidy, spacious better than some 5 stars we have stayed at. P.s. we're going back again. I might see you there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1086,Brisbane Couple,40,October 2016,"This is in a excellent location close to shops and restaurants. The rooms are good size, clean and the breakfast very good choice. The staff are very good and helpful and keep the hotel clean. It has nice restaurant and bar.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1087,We stayed for 12 days in a private villa at the Haven.,40,November 2016,"Ths villas are wonderful.. Each villa is spacious with a large open bedroom with large separate bathroom & toilet. Heaps of room with a kitchen where you could cook if you wished. A full size fridge was handy for lots of drinks out by the walled private pool. The outside courtyard & pool were perfect, the water warm, lots of sun in the middle of the day but also lots of shade. Handy lounges, perfect for an afternoon snooze. Right in the heart of all the action but really quiet in the villas. The Haven breakfast was a buffet with a large choice of fresh hot & cold options. Perfect poached eggs & omelettes too!
Attention to detail was spot on A huge bathtub with loads of salts, oils & pomades was wonderful.
My only real complaint is with the lighting. As an older couple with older eyes we really struggled to find things in the wardrobes after dark as there are no lights!

All in all a great place to stay with wonderful staff & a fantastic location if you like to be in the thick of the action.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1088,The Haven - not quite heaven,30,November 2016,"Stayed for a week in a one bed room suite. Check in was off putting as yes - I could pay for the room upgrade but I will have to pay for food/drink/room service as I go. Excuse me? I was told that I hadn't supplied a card as a guarantee (well you haven't asked me to) but they were happy to take the card after that.

Rooms are as described by other reviewers - in need of a bit of TLC but also very roomy and clean. The one bedroom suite had a kitchen area....but no kitchen items like pots and pans! Standard is 2 plates, 2 glasses and 2 wine glasses, plus two sets of utensils. Rooms were cleaned to a very high standard every day and the king size bed with lots of pillows was wonderful.

The hotel has 2 pools - one right at the front and one hidden at the back. Yes it doesn't get direct sun but the water is lovely and cool on a warm day. The pool day beds are a mix of double and single beds and the towels plentiful and clean.

Private beach area is just a 10 minute walk via the back reception area and the regular golf cart transport (every 2 hours on the dot) was very welcome.

All things aside, I could not fault the room service or breakfast or lunch by the pool. The location was fantastic and the suites being at the back meant it wasn't noisy. The place is perfectly located on Jl. Seminyak and is just a walk to the private area on the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1089,Normal spa,30,November 2016,It is my second time to come the Haven. The spa was still good with good massage skill. But it would better if the environment could be improved. Because I found a little bit noisy in the surrounding environment.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1090,Holiday Stay,50,November 2016,What a fantastic stay so far. The staff are super friendly and will accommodate your every whim. The rooms are clean and quite spacious. With two pools and two bars to choose from you could stay here all day and just chillax. From the moment we arrived we have felt nothing but welcomed. Highly recommend this place,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1091,Large rooms needing TLC,40,November 2016,"Stayed 7 nights in a very large double room with friends. The room and 2 balconies were huge and had everything. The kitchen bench and bathroom were needing much needed TLC with large cracks in floor and around bath and very mouldy/in grain dirt. The room that was to contain 2 single beds had a wooden base that could not be moved which meant friends were only sleeping 3cm apart. However the service was fabulous, breakfast was excellent and the grounds goegeous. The pools dont get alot of sun at all with being so close on both sides to high buildings. I loved the location, close to kuta and the nice part of seminyak and in between the beach and the shops. They also provided a birthday cake without any asking!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1092,Over booked!!!,20,November 2016,"Even though are group of 6 booked 5 months prior we didn't have the rooms we paid for the havens solution was to give us temporary rooms for a couple of days then pack up again and move to the rooms we paid for.A stand off with the manager led to us ringing around for another hotel which changed his attitude. After 2 hours waiting we finally got a upgraded room.Staff we're good ,breakfast good but room was run down,air-condition rattling and inefficient some lights didn't work. I won't be back. Lack of maintenance and grotty.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Our kids loved the front pool and the breakfast was great too. Staff were so friendly, and even went into the gardens to fetch the kids pool toys that got thrown around 😂. Such great value for money!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1095,Great hotel. Quiet but in the middle of the action!,40,November 2016,"We had four nights here. The location is in the south of Seminyak, almost in Legian.

The hotel is well run, busy and efficient. Our room was clean and the beds were very comfy.

Note that the hotel has two blocks of accommodation with duplicated pools and amenities. My brother was in a different building to us and it was a good five minute walk between our rooms. It seemed that the Suites were in the back block.

There was a shuttle bus running from the very back of the hotel to the beach. It was every two hours. We didn't use it. This exit was a short cut to another street.

We found we did a lot of walking around the hotel but we needed the exercise! You could get rooms closer to the pool.

The very long pool is good for doing laps if you need to work off the wonderful breakfast on offer! We liked how the pool had shaded areas and a basketball hoop to keep us active in the water! Drinks at the pool weren't cheap. $4.00 for a bottle of water!

If the price is right for you, don't hesitate to stay here.

Massages every night at Chiara, just down the street, were fabulous and oh so cheap!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1096,Great Spot,50,November 2016,"Just returned from a 3 night stay . Great location , clean friendly hotel .

1097,Not too bad,40,November 2016,"Stayed for 3 nights, first visit. 30-45mins away from airport. hotel is located on a busy street with many eateries, 24hr convenience stores, surf and beachwear shops, souvenirs shops and a supermarket nearby. 15mins walk to seminyak beach but there's also free shuttle from hotel to the hotel beach club at scheduled timing. quite a distance away from famous bars or restaurants or cafes, about 10mins ride. check-in was fast. room booked was the haven room with very basic amenities, shown on the website that the room comes with a bathtub but it doesn't have. so went to recept to only found out that you have to request for it. the front office staff was very nice and efficient to assist me in a room change and got me a much nicer room with full amenities. am super pleased with the room thereafter. room is inclusive of breakfast and they served quite a good variety of food from asian to western. in-room dining menu has a wide variety of food as well and is tasty, however is alittle expensive. wifi was pretty good as well. a good size pool with basketball hoop for some fun play. overall, service is great and the room price is reasonable. would be better if the staffs could further elaborate on their shuttle services.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1098,Great Location,40,November 2016,"Located an easy stroll to the beach, great restaurants, friendly staff and two big pools. The grounds are lovely and well maintained. There is a choice of two restaurants for breakfast - an extensive choice in both. The shower was over a very deep bath which would make getting in very difficult for anyone with mobility issues - I think some rooms have walk in showers, so check. Great to have a private beach club option with plenty of shade from both trees and umbrellas. Bintang supermarket is close by and stocks everything you might need.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1099,4good hotel,30,November 2016,This was an ok stay. Rooms were clean but not like the balinese style we had grown to love. Felt a bit clinical. Air con wasnt working so changed to another room but it was a twin instead of double. The pool was ok. The staff were fine. The location and breakfast were the best things about this hotel. Good for the price,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1100,"Very good, recommended",40,November 2016,"This hotel was very good, got it in a package deal with return flights from Melbourne for around AUD$950. Rooms are a decent size, beds comfortable, air con failed once but came back on. Had a slight problem with a blocked sink and leaking shower, but they came and fixed it promptly. We had a room that opened onto the pool area. I thought the locks on the sliding doors were a bit flimsy, a bolt lock into the floor would bet better and I wrote that in the customer survey. Room as a safe however. Breakfast is very good, larger variety, some items change daily. Coffee is just black filtered coffee but it's ok to start the day. The grounds and amenities are well kept. The safe as friendly and helpful. Reception staff have good English, the housekeeping staff a bit more limited, but they will go out of their way to assist you. I like a top sheet on the bed and after I asked for it once they made the bed for the rest of the week with it for me.
Easy walk to the beach, apparently they have deck chairs and transport down to the beach, but I didn't see it specifially noted anywhere obvious. The shopping strip and restaurants of Seminyak are a short and cheap taxi ride away, or walkable in about 25 min or so. There is a good supermarket a few doors up.
Overall I would stay here again and recommend it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1101,Awesome place to stay,50,November 2016,"Found out about The Haven online (Expedia) ... read a few reviews and was slightly worried, but no need to be. It was a fantastic place to stay. We're middle class people on a middle class budget and The Haven exceeded our expectations. Great aircon, great breakfast, great location, great rooms, great pools, great everything. This was our second time in Bali and our second hotel, and we'll definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1102,Excellent place to stay,50,October 2016,"After staying at a very average hotel for 5 nights it was fantastic to arrive at The Haven. I was surprised to find the hotel is huge, had previously been for dinner & seen only the front hotel units. WE stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was marginally more than a hotel room. HUGE. The suites have an entrance from double 6 street and separate reception & restaurant so you don't have to walk all the way back to the main entrance. That area is much quieter. Included in our suite booking is 2 hour window each afternoon where we could have drinks & canapes in the club lounge. The pools were a bit cold but welcomed the tropical landscape around the 2 back pools, maybe the main pool was warmer. The only downside was we were only there for 3 nights. Will definitely book there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1103,"Beautiful suites, fantastic service and great location",40,October 2016,"I stayed at The Haven for 5 days as a solo traveler in October 2016 and spent my first two nights in a suite, after which I moved to a standard Haven room because the suites were booked out.

The suites are beautiful, large and well-maintained with good pool side views. Definitely worth the extra money as I doubt you'd get such spacious accommodation in Bali for a similar price. They are located in the quiet area at the back of the hotel. The only complaint I would have about my suite was the poor water pressure in the shower, but this was not a big deal. I had decent wi-fi connectability.

The standard Haven rooms are very inconsistently maintained. There are many reviews on here describing them as dated and mouldy etc., and indeed the first room (third floor) I was given was very poorly maintained. I requested for a room change, and was then moved to a room on the first floor with a beautiful pool side view that was in much, much better condition. This new room was definitely worth the money, with my only complaint being poor wi-fi connection.

On the whole, The Haven was a great place to stay and I would definitely like to return. The customer service is fantastic and the reservation manager is quick to reply to any e-mails and requests - I managed to easily book an airport transfer and in-house massage before my arrival. The buffet breakfast has great variety with both Indonesian and Western food. There are two large pools to choose from, and a private area on double six beach. The beach is only a ten minute stroll from the back of the hotel, and there are shuttle services that operate throughout the day. I quite liked the food at the hotel restaurant, and thought the live music was good and not too loud to interrupt sleep.

My recommendation would be to pay the extra money and book a suite. If you decide to choose a Haven room, try scoring one on the first floor with a poolside view.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1104,Nice place,40,November 2016,"Very nice and friendly hotel, breakfast is good, staff are very helpful. They only problem is our room is a little far from the lobby.
Money exchange and a small super market are just in front of the hotel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1105,Great place to visit,40,October 2016,"We were actually not staying at The Haven but spent the day there visiting our friends. We were very happy with what we saw while we were there.. our friends loved it there and they stayed 2 weeks. We had a 2 bedroom apartment where we were staying in Nusa Dua but after seeing the size and Convenience of the 2 bedroom
Apartment at The Haven were very impressed.. they were so clean and spacious!! Swimming pools look like lots of fun and we didn't go obviously but our friend said that the Happy Hour was excellent!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1106,Great service. Good room and good food,50,October 2016,We stayed at The Haven recently and it was a beaut experience . The friendly staff were always ready to assist. I had a problem sending emails and their IT guy helped me work through it . He was outstanding .,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1107,Location,40,October 2016,"Stayed here recently for a week with family & a friend in 2 bedroom appartment which was quite nice with loads of room. There was a kitchenette but it was not stocked with any kitchen stuff such as plates or cutlery. I know you are mostly going to eat out nut for those with a young family then they might want to be able prepare some food.also had a problem with a table lamp in my room which gave me a shock when trying to figure out how to turn it off! Discovered it had been repaired (dodgily!!) with some tape. When we reported it the maitence guy was just going to put more tape on it but we insisted it be taken away as it was a potential health & fire risk! The breakfast was good & included. The location was great with The Bingtan Supermarket just a short walk up the road, lots of great shops nearby & resturants (including a great Japanese restaurant The Ryoshi). Double Six is very close & it will take you around a 20-30 minute walk to get to the beach(that's if you don't get sucked into the shops along the way!). This hotels has 2 large pools, 1 medium size one & a kids pool but like most hotels there are a limited number of lounges. The staff were great & very willing to help you. The spa was amazing & I recommend you have a massage. Overall I enjoyed my stay at The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1108,Relaxing getaway,40,October 2016,"Located in Seminyak clean, great service, friendly staff ,pools including a kids pool, close to shops, approximately 10 minutes from beach, great restaurants nearby really good buffet breakfast 5 minutes walk to supermarket",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1109,Worst stay in Bali,10,October 2016,"It is not a 4 star hotel because rooms are dirty and so noisy that you can't sleep or relax there. Breakfast is good but you have to pay for your coffee if you want something else than black coffee. Staff on the breakfast restaurant are a bit arrogant, not baliness kindness as elsewhere. Photos on internet are mostly from the suite area. If you are going to book a haven room read bad reviews.
I would never come back because the hotel wasnt as expected..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1110,Lovely Winter Escape,40,September 2016,"Stayed at the Haven for 4 nights in early September 2016. The hotel is in a really great location, close to lots of restaurants, shopping and a short taxi ride from central Seminyak. Staff are very friendly and polite. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment in the back building of the resort, which was quieter and had a really nice pool area. The room was comfortable, air conditioned and well appointed. The only issue we had was that our room keys were deactivated a couple of times, which seems to be an ongoing problem. However, the staff were reasonably quick to supply us with new ones. Generally a very relaxing pleasant stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1111,"Good but not great...a bit dated, dark and gloomy",30,October 2016,"Situated on the main shopping strip the Haven is amongst the hassle and bustle of Seminyak just north of Legian. Great spot with access to shops and bars and some really good restaurants. It is about a$3AUD taxi ride up to the top end of Seminyak to “eat St’ section where you can find Ultimo and Red Carpet champagne bar. About 15mins in a cab.
The Haven in not on the beach however it is a 10min walk. They also have a shuttle service golf buggy in the mornings and afternoons to their dedicated beach lounges. This is sectioned off specifically for Haven guests on Seminyak beach so you can relax under an umbrella on a lounge and have a cocktail or two. It’s not fancy but it’s functional.
Other amenities are a few different pools surrounded with trees which provide shade on hot days. You need to get a poolside lounge early to beat the mums and their kids. Poolside drinks are expensive. I booked a single room suite which had a kitchen and lounge area as well as the bedroom with 2 balconies for not much extra. It was nice to have the extra space. This also meant that I had free access to the Havener's Club from 4-6pm each day. This is like a business lounge where food and drinks are served and are free to guests with suites. It wasn’t really over the top and not well marketed by the staff but I used it twice for a free afternoon snack and a beer.
The staff were friendly and room service was prompt and cleaning thorough.
The buffet breakfast was good and served in the front restaurant and also the rear restaurant for those staying in the back section of the hotel. Saved a lot of long walks. The rear restaurant food was better than the front restaurant.
There was a supermarket within 5 Minutes’ walk which meant I could stock the kitchen and cook in the room which was handy. Also a circle K across the road for a last minute water or coke.
Gym was good but small. Get there before 7am.
There were a few things I was not happy about.
It was dark in the rooms. Due to the fact that it has 2 parallel buildings in the back section meant that the sunlight was blocked by the buildings so it felt dark and shadowed all the time. I wasn’t in the room much but it felt a bit gloomy. The décor is timber which is in need or a new coat of lacquer. It looked weathered and the rooms a bit dated. The windows were also quite dirty and hard to see through in spots. Made it even gloomier.
The main restaurant at the front had a fairly good menu but was a bit expensive and not high quality. Better options along the street. I suggest getting out of the hotel and finding other restaurants. Pantarei Greek restaurant is a good option with great music.
The room safe auto locked itself twice and then the batteries went flat meaning I had to call maintenance to open it. Not a big deal but indicative of the lack of attention to detail and maintenance within the whole hotel. Our room air conditioner started leaking water on 2 different occasions and had to be repaired. I slipped and nearly fell on the water. The bathroom was big but the lighting poor. The bath kept blocking when I was in the shower until I completely removed the steel plug so the water could flow out freely. The business centre at the rear had no working printer so I had to walk to reception. They couldn’t get their printer to work either and trying to print my itinerary and boarding passes was a 1hour episode. No-one knew what to do or how to get the printer working in the “business centre”. The PC’s were slow and using Windows XP which tells you all you need to know.
The free hotel Wi-Fi was very weak and dropped out regularly. It meant having to reconnect often and became annoying after a while. This hotel has all the facilities such as pools, restaurants and Wi-Fi and business centre but each is not well maintained. Food was average, Wi-Fi was unreliable, pools were small but ok, business centre useless and Havener’s club dark and a bit lifeless. Staff seemed unaware of the issues and took ages to resolve any issues encountered. Each of these issues were not major but combined were enough for me to feel my holiday was compromised. It was good but not great.
This hotel is tired and not maintained to a 4 star standard. It is cheaper than other, newer hotels in the area and that’s to be expected I guess. Given that I spend half my working life in hotels I’d only give this one 3 stars. Overall the place was comfortable and quiet and well located for the price. I would stay here again but there are newer, trendier places further north in Seminyak….however they are also full of teenagers.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1112,GREAT HOTEL IN BEST LOCATION,50,July 2016,"Great hotel in best location. Can walk to many restaurants and a 7 min walk to the Big Bintang Supermarket is a real plus. Back Entrance is a real bonus as takes you down to the beach in 10 minutes walking pass lots of shops and restaurants along the way. Best buffet breakfast served here, with so many options. Hotel room has everything you need. Stayed in a hotel room in July but this time trying out the suites when we return back in Nov for 14 days. Wonderful caring staff. Have been to Bali 20 Times like this location the best. J Gould from Perth",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1113,Pleasant and Comfortable Stay,40,October 2016,"Overall a pleasant stay, nothing much to complain. Hotel ambiance and amenities are well kept. I think some of the comments on here are exagerrated, about the hotel being 'too noisy, rooms are dirty and old.' Number one, if you want to stay way from the noise then can I suggest staying in quieter area like Nusa Dua, Seminyak is generally a busy area and the hustle and bustle is what makes the place unique.

About the rooms being dirty and old, again there is much exaggeration to this. The rooms albeit maybe, are not exceptionally kept but still were very comfortable and pleasant. My only comment on this would be- the cupboard doors in our toilet were worn out and hanging loose on its hinges. Apart from that, the bathub could have been kept better, visible residue of mildew could be seen.

Apart from that, we were a bit dissapointed with the menu of the restaurant. You claim that the restaurant is halal, as in the meat and poultry is sourced from a halal vendor but still choose to serve pork. This caused a little uneasiness for me, as there is no official halal verification. We had paid for your hotel breakfast but had to stay away from the meat and poultry because pork was being served along with other food that you claim to be halal, but fail to provide certification for. We acknowledge that Bali is denoted by a majority of Hindu believers, but that doesnt mean you can dismiss your Muslim and local guests who constitute to the majority of the Muslim population in Indonesia. Hope the hotel can consider this in the near future,.

Nonethless, we had a very pleasant experience and wouldnt mind staying here again. It's also a central location to the shopping, spas and the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1114,Good place to stay,40,October 2016,"The most memorable and outstanding things about this hotel are:
Staff very friendly and polite
Breakfast just perfect ( agree with egg man - more help required for him)
Security man always there to help you cross the road
Central to all bars and restaurants - better selection from the back entrance to the hotel
I've seen reviews about the music etc - being on holiday and hearing the band at nights added to the holiday feel - it did in no way keep us up or wake us up
However : they do need to work on the deactivation of the room keys - ours deactivated at the most 3x a day which was ridiculous being on the 3rd floor 36 deg heat and having to go back down to get it sorted - don't put it by your phone they said ... 9 times outta 10 we didn't.
Need more sun loungers - the greedy put their things on them then disappear which is not good travellers spirit ...
Clean and tidy - my friend did however have to get them in to clean mould from the fridge and bathroom ... ours was ok .... rooms made up everyday ....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1115,"Great location, friendly staff",40,October 2016,"Stayed in one of the suites, very large room, we had to change rooms as the first one we were given was dirty and very tired, Dayu, manager on duty did her best to accommodate us. Had a room facing the pool at the back of the building and it was very quiet, never heard any noise from the street. This hotel is very handy to Double Six street, plenty of cafes and restaurants at very reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and accommodating and some of them could do better if they had better English skills. Smoke is allowed everywhere so the hotel stinks of it, even the non smoking rooms. Buffet breakfast plentiful, freshly made waffles and pancakes and all sort of Asian dishes. The hotel doesn't have any facilities for disabled guests, stairs difficult to negotiate as no holding rails anywhere. The bathroom in our room very large but so difficult to get in, bath tap in the wrong position so water hit the side of the bath instead of going in the bath. Very poorly designed. Haven club available for guests in the suites but we attended just a couple of times as food offered appeared to be the leftovers from breakfast. Plenty of beer to be had though. All and all a good hotel, it could be much better if the rooms were updated.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1116,Not a 4-star hotel,20,October 2016,"We read many earlier reviews of this hotel and after reading complaints and replies from the hotel management we decided to give a try for this hotel. When we arrived we were anyway very disappointed. Things that the management has promised to fix in the replies is a big lie. I think it tells enough of the service in the hotel.

First thing that we noticed was the noisy room that people had mentioned in the earlier reviews and management has promised to fix it. Even if the balcony door is closed you can hear clearly the voice from the pool and the traffic. Later the music from the restaurant was really really loud. At this point we went to ask if we could change the room to the quiet one. Receptionist told us that it was only possible the next day and the music would stop at 10pm. Next day we changed the room but it was only a bit more quiet and voice from the outside is still easily heard. So going early to bed is simply impossible at this hotel (not good for families with small kids or people who come after a long trip).

And second, rooms are really plains and definitely not a 4-star hotel level (Haven room). Bed is very uncomfortable and rooms are old and dirty. Anyway, facilities in the room are pretty good and breakfast is nice.

If you want a hotel with good service, cozy and quiet room with a good bed and relaxing atmosphere you should not choose this hotel. Be careful when you read the reviews and look at the pics, don't let them blind you. We made a huge mistake by choosing this hotel because there is many better hotels with better price available in the neighbourhood. And we have been in many 4-star hotels in the same area, but none of them has been bad like this.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1117,Great location,40,October 2016,"I stayed four nights and the location and staff are great. I had two rooms, first was a twin bed and then a double. Both could have done with some minor refurbishment to bathrooms but are overall very clean and serviceable.
There is a beautiful pool area and restaurant is good. Hotel is located very close to everything.
I would stay here again without doubt.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1118,Fantastic suites,50,October 2016,"This was our second time staying at The Haven. The first time we stayed in the hotel section.

This time we were traveling with 2 children and so we chose a 2 bedroom suite. It was an excellent choice.

The suites are huge and perfect for a family. You basically get two good sized hotel rooms which a large living, dining and kitchen area in between. Each area has a balcony or terrace - 3 in total - including a double bed sized day bed on one.

We chose ground floor for easy pool access with kids, but for a quoted option a suite on a higher level might suit others.

The suites do look like they could do with a bit of renovation in places, but not to the extent that they look scruffy or that it impacts on your holiday. I do think some better lighting in the bedrooms would be good.

The pool area at the suites is lovely - quite shaded with stunning gardens. It was sometimes hard to get a sun bed and I did find the sun beds fairly uncomfortable.

Breakfast was fantastic with great (proper) coffee that was included.

The staff were friendly and very helpful. The location is great. Yes we will be back again if traveling with kids.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1119,Good Stay,40,October 2016,"We stayed in a Suite for 5 nights and requested 410 for the great views. We have been to Bali many times but never stayed at the Haven before. I really like this hotel. Great value for money, fantastic location with friendly and professional staff. The rooms are a bit worn, but they are by far the largest rooms we have ever stayed in. The property itself is beautiful. The pool area for the suites is like a green grotto and my favourite pool area of any hotel we have stayed at. We did have an issue with the air conditioner in the living room, but this was fixed quickly. I would stay here again just for the suite pool, handy location and value for money. Coffee with breakfast was pretty good, but we would also recommend “Repeat Offender” café for great coffee and food which is a two-minute walk from the back exit of the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1120,Great value for money,40,October 2016,"Great location, staff very friendly and provided great customer service. The complex offers great swimming facilities and the restaurant was pretty good. My only criticism was of the staff who did the egg station in the morning, he needs either assistance or some guidance on how to prepare eggs. He was so focussed on the omelettes (not multi skilled) if you ordered boiled or poached they were hard. I gave him feedback and tried to help him with the timing but still no good. So really a great experience, if eggs was my only criticism then couldn't be too bad.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1121,No working air conditioners?!?!,30,October 2016,"The hotel is very outdated, probably could do with a much needed make over. We were moved twice due to air conditioners not working - not great when it's hot & steamy (temperature not us). The towels & dressing gowns were grey not white.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1122,Amazing Villa!!!,50,October 2016,"Love Love love The Haven!! We stayed in a One Bedroom Pool Villa, and it was amazing. We have been to Bali over 10 times before, and never stayed in a villa with so much space... it's huge.
Great huge pool that gets sun all day! Great spot... great staff. It has become our fav !!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1123,Less than impressed,20,October 2016,"My partner and I have just stayed here and left a day early having paid for 3 nights. Majority of staff are good people with the exception of tour/taxi stand guys on the left as you exit onto the main road through reception. I asked them to book a day package turtle island trip temples dinner etc @ a cost of $55USD as advertised through a brochure at airport. This request was refused outright and instead they would try sell us a simular deal (themselves now running the tour) only catch is it took 2 hours longer didn't include dinner boat tickets to turtle island or water because ""you can buy yourself"" and wasn't in a group setting.

Breakfast was awesome great buffet variety yummy as.

Room was dirty and dated (haven room) with grotty bathrooms and safe boxes that aren't even screwed down so not safe at all.

Overall I wouldn't return just for a yum feed.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1124,Good location,40,October 2016,Second time at this hotel this time booked a 2 bedroom apartment with breakfast. The apartment is very spacious and well laid out. I would like to have the cooking facilities in the room as standard and not have to pre order but not a big problem. Staff at the hotel were helpful and always willing to help. I think they need to change the loungers at the pool to single beds as space is limited and many couples were using a double each. Liked having access to the private beach area and the club lounge in the afternoon. Breakfast good value based on the priced of the apaprtment. Would visit again,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1125,The Haven absolute bliss!!,50,October 2016,"We stayed at The Haven the first week of October,everything about the place is perfect located great shopping nearby! The staff can't do enough for you , I celebrated my birthday there they left me a delicious chocolate cake in the room .The spa treatments were fantastic,happy hour by the pool every day!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1126,Was a little disappointed this visit not sure if I will rush back,20,July 2016,"We have stayed here previously. The last time in a suite which was great. This time was not so great. We had booked a Haven room as we were arriving late and leaving early so thought we would just go for the room. As we had stayed here before we thought that we would get a return customer treatment but this was not so. We walked into the room and immediately went to open the balcony door as the room smelt damp when we opened the door we then were looking at a brick wall hmmm. After a while we decided to shut the balcony door but it would not lock so at 2am we were waiting for the maintenance man to come and fix the balcony door not what we really expected at this very early time of the morning.
So just to finish this off the next day I went into the bathroom and locked the door and went to leave the bathroom but the door would not unlock so I was locked in the bathroom. My husband rang and they were not in an hurry so after 15 minutes and me starting to feel a little claustrophobic he went looking for someone and they said another 10 minutes he emphasised that they needed to get some one now. spending this time in the bathroom allowed me some time to look at the cleanliness and I would say this has not been looked ay closely for a long time upon further inspection in the room showed that the room was not as clean as it looked on the surface. The management did upgrade to a suite which was nice but we were heading out for the day and not getting back until that night. When I was checking out I wanted to speak to the duty manager but they said they already knew what had happened. I then spoke to the receptionist that I was returning about a week later and did not at this stage have a booking anywhere. they gave me a card and said just book on line BYE. As you can guess we decided not to go back which is such as shame as great location but think will take a bit for me to return here. Such a shame",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1127,Another Perfect Stay at the Haven Suites,50,October 2016,"This hotel hasn't disappointed me yet.
On arrival at the airport after a 1 1/2 delay we were pleasantly surprised to see our driver from hotel still waiting for us at 12.30am!
The check in was fast, friendly and efficient.
We had a ground floor twin share room spotlessly cleaned every day and stock bathroom amenities everyday. Bed linen white and clean as with the bathroom towels white and fluffy.
Room air con was cool and on 24/7 with spare key.
Breakfast is extensive and lots to choose from all lattes and cappuccinos all included.
Hotel gardens are immaculately groomed and maintained.

I have to compliment the hotel management on how very friendly the staff are here always greeted with a hello and smile.

I haven't got one bad thing to say about this hotel its very good value for money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1128,Hot and underwhelming,30,September 2016,When we arrived there was no booking for us. We showed the paperwork from the on line booking site and then had to wait another 3 hours before our room was ready. When we finally got to the room there was no air conditioning and was told there was upgrades happening. The Internet was non existent in the room and could only access on the balcony or by the pool. The balcony door lock kept sticking (which we reported) and was never fixed properly. My friend was locked out there twice during our stay. A very disappointing experience overall. Think I'll stick with Kuta next time.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1129,Very welcoming staff and super relaxing,50,October 2016,"Great location, great staff. The 2 bedroom suites are HUGE and the 2 bedroom villas are AMAZING! We had our small intimate wedding in the villa by the pool and can highly recommend. Their attention to detail was outstanding and nothing was a problem. Would definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1130,The Haven Suites Stay...,40,October 2016,"We had 3 boys to accommodate with us aged 18, 20, & 22 yrs so the 2 BR suite was perfect. The boys had their own bedroom & BR/toilet,separated from ours with a spacious kitchen, dining, & lounge area. There were 3 flat screen TV's (1/BR & also ""living"" area). A wide balcony ran the length of our suite including daybeds. It overlooks a 2nd pool accommodating the suites primarily, so never crowded. Afternoon tea & drinks were a special treat for my hungry boys each day (inc. in accommodation). Suites were at rear but both front & rear entries/exits were onto busy shopping/restaurant strips.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1131,Mouldy and dated,20,September 2016,"Mouldy rooms & very dated. We payed the extra for a suite and did not expect to be greeted with mould growth especially when you pay the extra for a superior room. After asking to be moved, we moved to another mouldy suite. Again we asked to be moved we ended up moving to the a normal room for a night and then to a suite for a for the rest of our week in seminyak. Overall our stay in the haven was a disappointment to say the least.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1132,Nice Hotel in Seminyak,40,August 2016,"I was staying in The Haven for 6 days. The staffs were friendly. The facilities were good. The room was nice. Only the wifi in the hotel room was slow and it was hard to catch up the sun when I was at the pool.

Breakfast buffet was good. I loved the live music in the night.

4/5",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1133,Relaxing Stay,40,September 2016,"Loved this hotel. Great décor in the communal areas and in the rooms. Although not keen on the glass sided bathrooms. I was sharing a room with a male friend and even with the frosted sections I felt a bit exposed. I would prefer more privacy. The hotel, rooms and pool are all very clean. Really nice pool although not in the sun all day. The staff put towels out every on the beds so no need to bring your own.

The buffet breakfast was the largest and had the most variety of any of the hotels we stayed in during our trip. You could order omelettes, pancakes and waffles at the various stations that were cooked to your specification. There were plenty of other hot and cold choices, Western and Asian choices.

The staff were lovely, very polite and professional. Excellent tea and coffee making facilities in the room plus towelling dressing gowns and slippers. One thing I noticed all over Bali is that the hotels are not very generous with their towels and at every hotel we stayed in I had to ring housekeeping for an extra one to wrap my freshly washed hair in, as the hand towels were far too small and if I used the bath towel I only had a hand towel to dry myself on.

I would certainly stay at The Haven again; it was my favourite hotel of the trip.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1134,"Good, clean & value for money",40,October 2016,"I just got back from 10 nights here with my boyfriend. It's a good hotel with excellent value for money.
The rooms and facilities were clean and modern enough. The staff were lovely especially after we had a phone stolen (elsewhere, not at the hotel) and they sent us to the police station with a staff member to translate for us.
The cocktails were cheap (always a bonus) and rooms were cleaned beautifully each day.
There is a basketball hoop and balls in the pool and sometimes they set up pool volleyball and bar wrestling. They also offer free pool side yoga classes a few mornings a week.

A few downsides though:
- The hotel is split into three sections, we were towards the back of the first section and it's VERY noisy at night. The restaurant plays live music till about 10:30/11ish and it's so loud even with the doors closed. The bass actually vibrated through the pillow which was annoying when trying to sleep.

- The pool is nice (there is another pool down the other end). However, there are only two seats in the sun. All the rest are shaded by palm trees or the building which is a shame if you're trying to get some colour.

- It's quiet far out from all the action. The bars, good restaurants etc are a really far walk away. We walked to one one night and it took 50 minutes even though it was also in Seminyak. It's a taxi or scooter ride everywhere.

- Whilst the breakfast is good, the pool side and room service food isn't great. We had it a few times and were always disappointed. Fairly sure the pizza is from a box.

Would recommend it for a cheap and cheerful stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1135,Seminyak,40,January 2016,"Great stay. Lovely pool but hard to find the perfect spot to catch the sun. Although several days in I discovered a second pool. Hotel is lovely and clean. Room faced pool and all was totally lovely, especially the bathroom! The only real issue for me was that I had to catch a taxi into the main area or nightlife of Seminyak (oberoi st). On my next visit I'd prefer to be closer to the action. Totally depends what you're up for. I travelled solo so I'd rather not have the 5 min taxi ride home alone if I could avoid that. Breakfast was a little boring in selection - I'd personally be happy to skip brekky altogether. Staff were lovely and accomodating. You can catch a buggy down to the private beach where towels are supplied for you by hotel staff. Could also walk down but probably a 10 min walk to the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1136,Nice Hotel,40,October 2016,"Rooms a bit dated. But aircon, pool, lobby and restaurant all good. Buffet breakfast not the best I've had but nothing to complain about.

Wifi in rooms very slow. But restaurant pool and lobby all good.

Good for the price",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1137,Great location,40,September 2016,"We stayed 6 nights in one of the villas. The photos on the website do not do them justice, they spacious, light and very relaxing with a private pool. Breakfast was lovely and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Close to the beach and lots of beautiful restaurants. We will definitely return soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1138,A Pleasant Experience,40,August 2016,"I had the chance to be booked in one of the suite rooms. I like how spacious it is, and the bed is really comfortable. It has a balcony which is surprisingly well arranged for guests to relax but with an effort to make it still private. This place is a resort in itself. It has a swimming area all over the place (not the usual pool), and gardens are also all over which added to a resort feel environment. The place is located in the mainstream of Seminyak in Bali. I wasnt able to have a chance to experience the resto-bar, but it looks nice and cozy. The staff are accommodating and pleasant. I would not have second thoughts of going back to his hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1139,A Haven from the busy street,30,August 2016,"Overall happy with our stay. Bottom floor was great, just a few footsteps from pool. Dark room though and outdated. Lovely breakfasts and very friendly staff. Very close to plenty of shops, be prepared to barter!,,,",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1140,Great location,30,September 2016,"We stayed 8 nights at The Haven. We were impressed by the surroundings, pool ,gardens, restaurant etc. However the quality of our room left alot to be desired. Every day we needed to get maintenance to the room to fix something, sometimes twice a day. Twice I was locked in the bathroom without even locking the door which was unsettling. Made me very nervous using other bathroom facilities within the resort. We eventually got moved to another room was was an improvement. Overall we enjoyed our stay, but would have been better without all the maintenance issues.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1141,Well located Hotel,40,September 2016,"We have just spent ten nights at The Haven in Seminyak ,our stay was good with the staff pleasant ,helpful and cooperative at all times .
The rooms are becoming dated and the first room we were issued had some issues re mould in the bathroom before we were allocated another room . Rooms are being updated as you can see building works in progress. A Warning to all please keep all of your clothes off the ground and either put away in the wardrobe provided or your suitcase zipped up as friends of ours had several items of clothing destroyed because some of the cleaning products contain bleach and once squirted in the air disapates around the room in droplets .
The food at breakfast whilst good becomes a a bit same same over a ten day period but the standard is good for a hotel and the staff are welcoming and friendly .
All in all a good place to stay as its location is so central and drivers are always available outside the hotel to transport you around for a very fair price and there is a courtesy shuttle to take you to the Haven Beach club.
We will again stay here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1142,"Fantastic Stay, excellent location and staff",50,September 2016,"I was surprised after we checkin to hotel, looks and maintained better than in picture. Almost perfect location in Seminyak, beach within walking distance, they have beach club just in front of double six hotel which is free for suite and villa guests.
We stayed 4 days in 2 bedroom suite 201 and it was fantastic. For guest convenience they have 2 reception one at front and another at the back near suites and villa. 2 bed suite is spacious and has all amenities except Ironing board, they deliver kitchen pack only when you ask for it which is fine as not everyone cooks.
They have beach shuttle which runs every 2 hours (Strange frequency ) and last one runs at 5pm.
Staff is fantastic, best I have seen win recent times, every time they see you they will greet you and eager to help. 10/10 for them.
Their SPA although Expensive than shops outside but is worth and is very good.
They provide USD 15 F&B and $10 Spa voucher per stay.
Breakfast was good and suites and villa guest have addition privilege of tea and snacks between 4-6pm at lounge which was great. They have one way free pickup or drop off to airport which is plus.
Sabheen restaurant is good.

Only 1 negative, when we were ordering lunch from Sabheen restaurant and paying the part amount from F&B voucher provided by hotel then one Chinese looking staff made some comment (was making fun of us) to another staff in front of us as if guest using vouchers are ..... This happened one day before checkout on 21st September at 2:25pm, this is ridiculous behaviour.

Everything else was perfect.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1143,Horrible,20,September 2016,I had a great experience of staying in Haven in 2011. Hence I decided to stay for another night in September 2016! I was surprised by the condition of the room. The first room I got was in the basement floor which have direct access to the pool. But the room was smelly and moldy! I started feeling sick after staying 10 mins in the room. I asked to changed to a new room and the staff wasn't too happy about my request. I ended up getting another room which is one floor higher. It's slightly better but I could still smell the mold in the air.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1144,Very good hotel,50,September 2016,"Very clean , good stuff , clean rooms ,beautiful , we stayed there for 9 nights , we went to bali for vacation and did all sort of activities (sea walking,diving , flying fish , dolphin watching at sunrise in Lovina , interacting with dolphins ... Visited all type of places like waterfalls and temples ....) we woke up and had breakfast in the restaurant at The Haven ( sabeen restaurant) every morning and there is all kind of Indonesian food ( which i personally didn't like much in taste and smell ) and missed the food presented in mediterranean and european breakfast but i enjoyed mostly the fruits ,and after spending all day outside we came back every night to find our rooms clean and well organized , the rooms are big with comfortable beds , everything was very good with nothing to complain about ( the only problem we encountered is that they asked for a master card to keep with them or they will take everything from the fridge , as we had one and i didn't want to give it away as we may need it , the second option they proposed is to pay in cash whenever we wanted to eat , and take out everything from the fridge in our rooms which wasn't a problem because you can fill it up with anything you want from the nearby stores just next to the hotel) , we tried once the pool and it was nice swimming there ( it wasn't too cold) , unfortunately we didn't have time to try the beach even though we spent there more than a week ( as it is also far away from the hotel by walk) , so i can say that our stay in The haven in our trip to bali was a very good choice , we also got lucky with a very helpful driver (referred by some friends) who was always smiling and never complained once and helped us a lot , if you want to visit bali and visit many places there i recommend him ( he agreed on 35$ (his car can fit to 6-7 people) per day for the ride but we gave him more than 50$ per day because he is such a simple trustworthy and very honest guy called jhonn +62 815-5836-5188 ) . Enjoy bali , a must see destination!!!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1145,Second time better than the first,50,August 2016,"Stayed 10 nights in Villa. What's not to like - from staff, accommodation, private pool, drinks, etc I could go on. Have stayed in suite previously but the closeness to general pool can be too noisy. Will be back next year without a doubt.

Bonus three A/C units in the villa - no problems.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1146,What's not to like!,50,August 2016,"We stayed in a private villa for a total of 2 weeks and it was everything we expected. Large rooms, kitchenette, luxurious bathroom area including spa bath and inside/outside showers, beautiful thick luxury towels, very comfy large bed, and our own private pool with deck. Staff are very friendly and efficient and respond to requests very quickly. Breakfast is the normal buffet type but everything is so fresh and staff will cater for all needs. We certainly recommend highly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1147,Great place for a family stay in the heart of Legian / seminyak,40,September 2016,"We stayed at the haven for over a week in a 2 bedroom suite. It is a great location close to shopping and plenty of restaurants, massage places and the beach. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the buffet breakfast is fantastic, with many choices available.
It has 2 main pools which are both great.... We would definitely stay here again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1148,Still a good place to stay in Seminyak,50,September 2016,"This was our second time at the Haven still a very good option for the Seminyak area central to the beach and also Seminyak square ,about a 5 minute walk to the beach and 20 minute walk to Seminyak Square or 5 minute by taxi at cost of about 25000-30000 rph .The hotel facilities are very good and the breakfast is not bad for a buffet breakfast also , we stayed in suite which was very spacious and comfortable 2 large balconies overlooking the pool area was also very nice . The staff where very helpful and friendly, would not hesitate to book at The Haven the next time we are in Bali",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1149,Hot Haven,30,September 2016,"My partner and I stayed at the Haven for a week. Pool was fantastic, the SPA was relaxing & the spa ladies were so welcoming. Food was average but there are so many great places you can eat out at.

Our room was very disappointing, no air con for 1 week despite telling the hotel staff. We had a technician look at our a/c and he advised it wasn't working but would look into it asap. Front desk shortly called after with great news it would be fixed and in working order within 1 hour. Once we returned back from dinner a/c still was the same. It was a hot & sweaty week getting ready to go out. On check-out the front desk didn't seemed too fussed our a/c wasn't in working order, no compensation was offered.

The bathroom lighting could also be better (very orange and dim), not great for women trying to get ready.
I have had read other reviews and these seem to be common issues with the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1150,It's good hotel nice location,40,September 2016,"Its okay..room good enough for 2 balcony small one, bathroom is fine.
Good swimming pool.
Nice food at lobby view on street.
Location excellent if you looking shopping, bar, food,massage and walking.
the ocean just 10 minutes walk.
Good price.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1151,Average stay,30,September 2016,"My partner and myself stayed here for 8 nights after reading good reviews here on TripAdvisor. We arrived around 6pm where the porter was helpful in bringing out bags to the reception however when we checked in we were informed that the room we had paid for was not ready as they had some how doubled booked us with someone else. The staff member apologised however we had to stay in a twin room for one night. The staff member said they would put us in a king sized room the next day. We were slightly annoyed however it was only for one night.

The next day we were told that we could move into the room around 3pm after the 12pm checkout and cleaning of the room. 3pm came and we contacted the reception, even though they should be contacting us since we are the guests, and they then informed us the guests in that room were having a late check out. The new time to move to the room was now 6pm, we were getting a little more annoyed because our day was wasted arriving back at the hotel prior to 3pm as we thought we were going to be moving at that time. So 6pm came and we didn't hear anything from the reception so we called them and again was told that we couldn't move to the room until 8pm. At this stage we were more than annoyed and the hotel had made me feel like we made a mistake staying here. Finally 8pm came and 30 mins later we were finally in the room. The room was on the lower ground level with pool access but it was quite noisy in the mornings.

The breakfast was good with a good range of choices with my favourite being the fresh cooked pancakes. The pool area was nice but there is not much room for many sun beds. The hotel restaurant had a good selection of asian and western dishes with nice pizzas. The hotel itself is in a great area in walking distance to most shopping areas and restaurants.

When we checked out we rang the reception for a porter to assist us with our baggage. The staff member on the phone said someone would be there soon, we waited for about 10 mins but no one came. I stood outside and asked passing staff members if they saw a porter coming to our room but they did not respond, either from the language barrier or because they didn't not want to help us. In the end we just took our luggage ourselves to reception as we didn't want to be late to the airport. The staff member at check out completely ignored the fact that no on helped us with our bags, I could not wait to get out of that hotel. No surprises when no one helped us with our luggage from the front desk to our transport at the front of the hotel.

Overall it was an average stay because of the bad check in and check out experiences we had, I wish we had a better experience that others have had at this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1152,Loved this place,50,June 2016,"Myself and three friends stayed here for the first leg of our trip to Bali. What made this stay so special, was the tourguide - I cannot recall his name but he was so friendly. We did 2 day trips with him having only met him at the desk in the hotel. He was so accommodating and it was great that it could all be organised between us and him in the hotel. The food in the hotel was gorgeous, the pools were fantastic, the rooms were great and cleaned every day. The location is PERFECT for exploring Seminyak and is close to shops, bars, restaurants and spa's. We went to the spa beside the hotel which was great also.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1153,Lee,50,September 2016,"The Haven is a great choice for Bali.
Firstly the Haven was clean and comfortable. The location suited us to the ground. Shopping at the front and back door and the beach just down the road.
The staff were excellent.
Security excellent.
My husband and I have no hesitation in recommending The Haven, in fact we are in the process of booking our next trip.
Cheers",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1154,"Nice hotel, but could improve",40,September 2016,"Hotel itself is beautiful and staff in the restaurant, pool and porter were very helpful and welcoming and were great at acknowledging each guest and assisting them when needed. Shame the same can not be said for the Front Office team. Front desk team did make it slightly difficult and were not so welcoming or easy to deal with at any point. When trying to organise a late check out it seemed as thought i was being a pain. On check in as well the staff were not very helpful, however they did upgrade me for the first night of my stay. The 1 bedroom suite i stayed in on the first night was beautiful, clean and had an amazing view. I was then moved to my room i originally booked on the second night, which as i was alone was perfect for me and had a lot of natural light however i would not recommend the room for a couple, too small. The room on the first day was clean, however every day after the cleaning of the room was not up to standard at all. I found a bloody band aid in the room and no rubbish was taken away until the second last day, room amenities was only refilled once and i came back to my room on one of the days to see that the housekeeper must have left in a rush as she left a packet of cotton swabs behind and some rubbish. I also discovered on the last day when doing my last check of the room to make sure i had everything that there was some old meat bones under the chair on the balcony that must have been there throughout my stay as it was not me who left them behind. Breakfast was great however could be extended till 10:30 for those late risers. Customer service, cleanliness and attention to detail could do with improvement. Pillows were great!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1155,2nd time at the Haven,40,September 2016,"We booked a one bedroom suite and it did not disappoint. It's very spacious with a kitchen, living area and comfy big bed. Staff are friendly and they greet you when you walk past. I agree with other comments regarding the upgrade needed regarding the broken tiles but honestly it didn't bother me at all. The air con was cold. It was on 18° and after a couple of days we had to turn it up to 22°
Definitely worth getting the suite, you also get access to the lounge area for afternoon tea. Breakfast is a tad better than the hotel side (IMO)
The smaller pool closer to the restaurant is shaded so it's colder than the main pool but we see it as our own private pool as no one else was in there.
Overall, it was an enjoyable stay and will definitely come back here next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1156,Beautiful hotel with friendly staff,50,June 2016,"We stayed for 10 nights in the hotel, staff are amazing and so friendly! Their breakfast buffet was delicious and had different varieties everyday, would recommend their spa facilities to everyone. The location is so central and it's only 10 mins walk to the beach!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1157,It's just a room,30,September 2016,"Outside of the hotel looks inviting and pleasant once inside most staff are friendly. Unfortunately the check in staff were not helpful or friendly when we first checked in making us wonder what we have got ourselves into. The porter was lovely that took us to our room however the bed was set as a twin when the reception staff asked specifically what arrangements we required. The room is average. Hotel has been around for 7 years and requires upgrades, especially the air conditioning. We had ours set for 15C and the lowest it got was 21C otherwise it was 24C for the entire trip. We did receive a letter saying they are upgrading the air conditioning this month, hopefully this happens. Mattress was comfortable and pillows ok. Curtains blacked the light out apart from the ends. We had a couple of issues with the key cards but easily fixed once we went to reception. Wifi kept dropping in and out and is very very slow at times. The walls aren't sound proof, the music from the restaurant is heard clearly from the room but stops around 10pm. Breakfast was included and was a good selection of food from traditional Indonesian to western. Staff at restaurant were good, the front of house lady remembered us everyday and we did not need to let her know our room number, our name OR if we had tea or coffee! We mainly stayed around the lovely pools which are cleaned daily. The staff were nice always asking if we wanted drinks. We ate by the pool most days and the food was lovely, highly recommend to share the triple decker chicken burger! They have a spa here but never tried it. Can always get cheaper on street for similar services. The location is good, not far from double six beach, were they have a ""beach club"" (a section of beach with sun lounges) they do shuttles down during the day. Lots of shopping around. They have a Havener's Lounge that you'd only go for a look if included in your accommodation. We paid to enter and have afternoon tea but it was not worth the money we paid. We got the room at half price for the time we spent here and that is all I would have wanted to pay. I would not pay full price for the room. Overall it's relatively clean, good location and most of the time nice staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1158,Better than expected,50,June 2016,"My wife and I stayed at the haven in a one bedroom suite for 9 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. The suite is well worth the money as it is huge and very comfortable.
The pizzas at the pool could be improved a bit I think and the wait for drinks at the pool was sometimes very long. Breakfast was very good with a good selection of foods to choose from.
Overall excellent
Will stay again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1159,"Fantastic, but a little tired",40,August 2016,"I spent 10 nights at The Haven in a one bedroom suite (0315), I would've given 5 stars, but the place is in need of some TLC (cracked tiles and furnishing are little worn)
The suite I was in was massive, apparently around 97sqm, so as you can imagine for one person, I had all the space I needed.
The suites are located at the rear the resort, so it's very quiet and peaceful. Pool area is shaded and the water on the cold side, but after the heat of the day, it've very welcoming.
Rooms are clean, the bed is huge and comfortable, kitchen (which I never really used), lounge area is good space and 2 balcony areas (one with a double bed).
Staff are friendly and very helpful.
I didn't have breakfast, so can't really comment, but walking past most mornings, it looked pretty damn good.
All in all, The Haven is in a great place and I can't wait to get back there in March next year.
I can highly recommend and if you choose to stay at The Haven, pay the little extra for a suite.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1160,Perfect!,40,September 2016,"One bedroom suite was amazing, plenty of living space and cooking facilities however there were no saucepans or fry pan which I thought was strange. In saying that you could easily stay a week or more no problem. The pools were lovely and lots of lounges around the pool. Great location within walking distance of restaurants, bars, cafes, shopping and if you don't mind walking (approx 15 mins), not too far from Seminyak beach. Brekkie was plentiful with lots of choices. My only complaint would be there was an awful sewerage smell that seemed to come from the drain after taking a shower. Staff were friendly and always helpful. I would definitely stay again and recommend to others 😀",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1161,Nice,40,July 2016,"a comfortable stay at the haven. They have nice rooms, a nice pool, a nice bar/restaurant. It was clean and comfortable. they offer a shuttle to the beach were they provide lounge chairs next to a restaurant and surf school.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1162,second time around,40,July 2016,"We like the larger suits , good layout , however the place need some refurbish , the floor tiles and also the furniture are partly not in good shape . but location and relative easy way to the beach . The breakfast could be better , Very much on cost constrain , not much choices if you are a breakfast person",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1163,Shaven Haven,40,August 2016,"I have just spent 10 nights with my wife and 18 month old child in suite 0919. (The photo is the view from the balcony.) If you like a bit of extra space and want value for money then look no further than the suites at the Haven.

My daughter is a noisy sleeper so her cot was placed in the lounge room which enabled my wife and I to get a good night's sleep in the adjoining bedroom. My slumber was broken regularly every morning around 0500 by kitchen staff pulling trolleys over gaps in the paving ""clunk clang clunk clang"". A small oversight in landscape design which could be rectified I'm sure.

Check in was fast and fairly straight forward, but it would of been nice if reception was forthcoming about the free wine and cheese on offer every afternoon between 1600 and 1800 for suite and villa guests. They did mention however if there were any problems to dial 1 on the phone. I won't go into detail, but all the problems were fixed within half an hour and there were no more problems with the room for the rest of the stay. Three cheers for housekeeping and engineering! They did everything required.

Yes, the pools are a little on the cool side, but after spending a bit of time in the tropical heat the last thing you want is to swim in warm water. The other upside to the shade over the pool is you are not constantly reapplying sunscreen.

Lastly I'd like to say a big thankyou to all of the staff at the suite breakfast buffet. My daughter made such a terrible mess there every morning. After the first day you served the coffee just the way my wife and I like it, which by the way is free at the suite buffet and not at the Sabeen restaurant buffet. You are all wonderful, with your cheerful smiles and obliging nature's. X",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1164,"Loved our stay, would stay again!",50,August 2016,"We are still at The Haven, and thought we'd write a review whilst still fresh in our mind! We were going to book the standard hotel room but then decided to pay the extra for a suite as I'd read they were in a quieter location and near back of the property overlooking the more lush gardens and pool. Our room was fantastic, to be honest we didn't use the living area or kitchen but was nice to have so much space! A great day bed out on the balcony and looking out towards the trees and pool. We stayed on level 1, we'd reccomend requesting floor 1 or above as the ground level you have less privacy with guests walking past to the restaurant or lying next to the pool. Buffet breakfast was great, day spa was beautiful (we had 2 treatments! And would highly reccomend booking, a beautiful clean and relaxing spa environment surrounded by the gardens with treatments around the $25aud mark). I would definitely stay here again (in a suite) as I can't vouch for what the hotel rooms are like, they are located at the front of the property close to the road so a little bit noisier. Hotel location great- in between Legian and Seminyak and heaps of shops and restaurants on Jl Seminyak and nearby",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1165,Stopped in for a drink,40,August 2016,"Only one in our group ended up having a drink, a Bintang, but we found that they have soy milk available for Soy Lattes. The environment was beautiful and the friendly staff shared the wifi login. Overall it was a cool respite and a rest for four pairs of feet which had trudged much of Jalan Legian.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1166,Beautiful villa,50,August 2016,"Stayed in a one bedroom villa on advice of our travel agent.

Beautiful, private and quiet room with private pool. Luxury touches in the room with great, high pressure shower.

Convenient location and yummy, wide variety buffet breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1167,Happy Stay,40,August 2016,"This the first times i stay at this hotel at bali. The hotel location is in a heart of seminyak bali, the hotel decorations is very nice and very warm, have a villa and the suite. I stay at the suite one bed room, the guess room is very big and the bed room is big enough. The lighting is very nice.
The service is good and the staff is very helpful.
I think the breakfast menu should be improved the menu and make more variety of food.
i will be back to stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1168,Hmmmmm,30,August 2016,"Such a mixed review of this place. Its got a good location right on border of seminyak and legian and is well known for its great food at the restaurant. We stayed for 1 night,which understandably meant we were put in a basement room right next to noisy part of pool. The bed is comfy and room is good sized with a tv wifi etc.
The bathroom however....right next to the bed with glass walls so NO provacy when in the shower or toilet. I could actually see my fiancee in the loo. Hated it. Another thing is we arrived and mentioned we had paid for breakfast but had an early check out so could we cancel it....they insisted it was fine nd they would organise an amazing breakfast box to be delivered to us t 6am. We waited for nearly 45 mins but nothing came. As we checked out the guy did he had no idea what we were talking about...so we paid for something we never got! Also be mindful the standard check in time on really late...3pm!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1169,End of a wonderful Bali and Lombok holiday,40,August 2016,"We've chosen the Haven suites as a reasonably cheap end of our trip to Bali, Gili and Lombok.
Their family room offer was very interesting (paid around 300 euro for 2 nights, incl breakfast for the 4 of us). Didn't expect that much, but too be honest it exceeded our expecations. The room turned out to be 130sqm - 2 large bedrooms ensuite, plus a sitting and eating room. For those interested: 3 tellies and their DVD...
Breakfast buffet was taken care of. The pick up at the airport was very nice and friendly.
And the (small) beachclub was very convenient for us. My children took a 2 day class in surfing (age 10 and 7) - absolutely to be recommended!
The Haven even offers a ""executive club"" - basically like the Hilton and other business hotels who offer this specific floors with extra's. But very interesting to use on your last day - you can change, shower after beach hours and even drink / eat something here. After you've checked out!
In short: don't expect to be in Anantara, Oberoi or W here in Seminyak. But if you look at the price difference: this is by far a much more interesting deal, saving you quite some dollars to spend at other things to do here!
So why not a 5 star rating: staff professionalism. They are friendly, but I think it is due to a lack of communication (and English skills): we faced quite some administrative issues. Which is very annoying during holiday...
But still a very satisfied customer.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1170,Our favourite Haven,50,August 2016,"Just spent another wonderful 3 weeks back at The Haven.
It really is a gem of a Hotel, with simply the best staff and management team,
All so obliging and friendly.
The grounds are beautiful , rooms are cleaned to the highest standard , and maintained very well.
Loving the new room service menu also.
A very Happy 7th birthday to all The Haven team and we look forward to returning in a few months.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1171,Fabulous stay- recommended!,40,May 2016,"We stayed in late May/ early June 2016, husband and 20 month old baby in a one bed suite. We definitely enjoyed having the space in the suite, we put our little one to sleep in the lounge room/ living area, there was a door separating the two areas, which meant we could relax in the bedroom after she had gone to sleep. The downside to the living area was the curtin in the room was not really block out and let light in a bit earlier then we would have liked. Saying that she managed to sleep to almost 7 am most days. For naps we moved her cot to the bedroom which the curtains were blackouts. We had requested a portacot, but ended up bringing our own, which I'm glad we did as the one in the room was a bit soft and had definitely seen better days. Our bed in comparison was excellent, firm yet soft enough. Breakfast was great, very wide selection and good service. Several pools, all with plenty of comfortable shaded loungers. Location was great, easily walk out and grab lunch and dinner and easy walk to beach. All in all great trip and highly recommended!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1172,10/10...or in this case 5/5 :),50,August 2016,"Amazing hotel could not fault it - super friendly and helpful staff, great location, excellent facilities - the spa is fantastic - oh and breakfast is sooo good! Great value for money too. Highly recommended!",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Thank you for making our holiday so wonderful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1174,Pleasantly surprised!!,40,August 2016,"The Haven represents great value for money in Seminyak. We stayed in a Haven Room - huge rooms with a large balcony. The beds were really comfortable & the bath towels are of a 5star standard!! The staff are all very pleasant & friendly. The only thing I could complain about, is that breakfast starts to get repetitive after a couple of days.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1175,Beautiful stay!,50,August 2016,"From the time we checked and all throughout our stay we have been greeted with smiles and happy faces all round.
Check in was a breeze (although there was a mix up with two singles instead of a double, that was our fault and it was fixed the next night without hassle). Staff were very friendly and more than accommodating to anything we asked for.
The buffet breakfast is a must. We dined here every morning before trekking out for the day and was pleased every morning. Even the chef cooking omelettes to order would remember what you liked.
The beds are super comfy, crisp linen, plenty of pillows and the rooms are extremely clean and tidy.
Room service is fast (Bali fast) and exactly what you order.
I'm definitely coming back to stay.
Thank you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1176,Quite surprise,40,August 2016,We booked at the haven not knowing what to expect and were very surprised by the accomodation.

1178,Have fun at the Haven Seminyak,50,August 2016,"I stay for 3 nights (12-16 august 2016). It's comfortable place, affordable price.... I'll gave 3 star for breakfast, cos not much variation during stay there & 5 star for room, facilities, service....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1179,Absolutely Stunning!,50,August 2016,"Staff were very accommodating and welcoming. The room was comfortable, right near the pool, very clean and the food was to die for. It is only about 5 minutes from Seminyak square with plenty of choices of restaurants bars around. The food at the restaurant and breakfast were to die for and best Nasi Goreng I ate all trip. Perfect for families, couples or friends. Can't wait to stay again at The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1180,One of the worst places you could stay in Bali!,10,August 2016,"My boyfriend and I have been to Bali many times, however this was our first time staying in Seminyak. Based on the reviews on Trip Advisor and the word of a travel agent we decided to book 10 nights at The Haven. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and were told that our room would not be ready until 3pm. We decided to go and check out the hotel restaurant while we waited. We were served a pizza that was less than satisfactory, however it filled the spot! We finally checked into our room at 3.45! We walked in and were immediately hit with a damp, mouldy smell. My partner suffers from bad asthma and this room was not going to be suitable for our 10 night stay. We rang reception immediately and asked to change rooms. We waited in reception for another 35 minutes while they sourced another room for us. They took us to the next room which smelt like they had placed a frangipani tree in the air vent! Whatever they had sprayed was far too strong and I knew it would only temporarily mask the smell of yet another mouldy room. This room however also had an aircon set on 32 degrees. We called reception who sent the aircon 'engineer' who told us that infact the temperature that the device was displaying was the outside temperature!!! (We are not this stupid). We went to reception and asked to speak to a manager. We were left waiting by reception staff who went back and forth and encouraged me to speak to a manager over the phone. I refused and asked for someone in person and strangely enough, the managers office was approximately a 5 metre walk. Our experience on our first day and checking into this hotel was a disaster!!! We asked to move to the other side of the hotel and be placed in a suite, however we were told these were all booked! They finally moved us however much to my disgust we had to pay 25AUD extra a night! This hotel is run down and old and the customer service from the management team needs major improvement! This should be classed as a budget hotel with the likes of evaporative air conditioning (definitely not suitable for Bali)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1181,"Great hotel, room, position, breakfast and pools",50,August 2016,"First time at the Haven.
Position was great, close to shops and 10mins walk to beach. Room was fine although I understand the suites and villas are better. A/C was great and balcony pleasant. The daily breakfast was really very good and the gym quite adequate with all machinery in V.Good working order.
The staff were all very friendly and the resort very clean and tidy.
The best part were the pools which were great for either a relaxing sit or a more energetic lap swim. Although moost of the seating was shaded.

Looking forward to returning with friends where we'll book a suite.
Highly recommended !!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1182,Very Happy.,50,August 2016,"For what we paid, we were pleasantly surprised :) sitting at the buffet breakfast now and the food is not 5 star but still very nice.

The rooms are spacious and clean (finishing isn't perfect though).

The service and staff and very nice.

Highly recommend for couples and families (we left the 4yo at home)! We are staying at the back of the hotel, personally we believe it is a nicer area than the front.

Overall, a top hotel... for first timers to Bali!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1183,Great stay and excellent room,50,January 2016,"We booked into the Haven after a ferry journey from the Gili Islands, and the Haven was a welcome break!! The main entrance has a lovely view, with nice gardens and a waterfall.
We checked into the main the reception desk and was offered a cold towel and taken to our suite, on the ground floor at the back off the hotel. The suite was amazing, nice and big the main the living room was comfortable with a balcony that had a view off the gardens and swimming pool, and the same for the bedroom.
The kitchen was in the suite was clean and well equipped.

over all the suite was comfortable, clean and good value for money. A short walk to the beach too.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1184,"Noisy, noisy, noisy",20,September 2015,"This hotel has a great location, great atmosphere sitting out the front watching the world go by, nice pool, friendly staff but that's it. Rooms are starting to look old. Once it's time to go to bed, the music from the front of the hotel is soooooo loud! I struggled trying to get to sleep and I had ear plugs in!!!!! Can't imagine if I was there with my kids, that would have been a nightmare trying to get them to sleep! Also my swipe card to my room didn't work 5 times, each time I would have to walk the long distance, catch a lift, walk to reception to complain and get it fixed. This happened 5TIMES!!! I was losing my mind in frustration! I would not stay here again and I would not recommend this hotel to my friends and family.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1185,GREAT HOTEL ROOMS ARE GREAT,40,September 2015,"This is a great hotel,rooms are very clean and cosy,service is a little off,reception is busy at the front ,check in at the back is better and much faster,nice pools there are 2,and the buffet fast is fantastic.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1186,Value for money,40,August 2016,"This Hotel offers good value for money with very good sized family suites, and very nice recreational areas split between the hotel complex in the front and the family suites at the rear.

There are restaurants at either end of the facilities and the outstanding aspect of the hotel is the quality of service. Staff are friendly, extremely well trained, and are very responsive to guests requirements.
Menus are available to suit all food tastes.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1187,Disappointment at The Haven.,20,August 2016,"We checked in on the 8th August and was given a very basic dirty room. The Haven room. After contacting front desk they offered us another room straight away. Not much better but slightly and was towards back of hotel so not so noisey. Very dated broken bed not clean and was not 4 star as advertised at all. Today Day two 9th when we were showering, the drain blocked and had to call to get fixed. They sent someone straight away to fix but at 10.30 at night is a bit of a pain. Staff and food are very good and cannot complain about them at all. Very happy with that side of service. Just the state of the rooms. Location is great. Definately not 4 stars as advertised on most websites.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1188,A nice three star hotel.,40,August 2016,"What I expected for a three Star hotel. Daily room service with basic amenities. Staff were very friendly and the 1,500idr breakfasts are insanely great value. Definately worth considering for an average price/average with stay in Central Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1189,Great location,40,August 2016,"We stayed here for the second time in August in a villa. Stayed 3 nights, great large villa, fantastic bathroom, huge bed, fantastic pool. Only problem some of the villas pools are overlooked by the rest of the rooms. The villas are very clean and well equipped, all the staff are very polite. The club lounge was great to have a shower and freshen up before a midnight fight home. Very central location.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1190,Great stay!!,40,August 2016,"Stayed in 2 bedroom suite, very spacious & clean. Few cracked tiles & stains on kitchen bench top. Front of the hotel is not impressive until you enter & see the beautiful gardens & several pools that are well maintained just like in the photos. Staff are very friendly & helpful. Hotel is located on a very busy street & close to Bintang supermarket, BMC Money changers, spas & shops. Good variety of Indonesian & western food for breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1191,Don't let the star rating fool you.,20,August 2016,Unfortunately this hotel looks nothing like the photos. We were excited to stay here as it looked amazing and the star rating was high. The staff were lovely and check in was very easy but unfortunately that's where it stops. We were apparently given a room upgrade as there was a problem with our initial room. I would hate to see what the original room would have been like if that was anything to go by. The place was falling apart and the only thing clean was the bedding. Within a half hour of being in the room our air conditioning unit became deafeningly loud and dumped water all over the floor. This was fixed but the mess left in the process was not cleaned at all. Overall we were very glad we stayed only one night. Very central but would not recommend. Not worth the money.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1192,Paradise!,50,August 2016,"We stayed two nights here in a one bedroom suite. The suites are in their own separate wing with lovely gardens. The room was great, some grouting issues in the bath and shower but apart for that loved it.

You also get free breakfast and fee afternoon tea included.

The staff were fabulous and will definitely be staying again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1193,RETURNED TO THE HAVEN AS ITS A GREAT PRICE AND GREAT PLACE,50,August 2016,"Second visit to the Haven and it hasn't disappointed me. I loved it last time and love it this time. Once again I requested a ground floor Haven room right by the pool and got it! Love to just walk out of my room and onto a lounge by the pool. Different time of the year as last time so the front pool got all the sun whilst the back pool was shaded.

All of the the staff through from reception, pool, restaurant, security and the cleaners are all wonderful, very friendly and polite and helpful. The room and bathroom are really nice and even has a DVD player and is cleaned to a top standard too, very happy.

This time the price was a bit higher but possibly due to higher season and I also had breakfast included this time so the price reflects this I guess. As long as the price doesn't go up I will continue to return.

The breakfast is fantastic with a great selection and even though I don't eat waffles, crepes etc they are there and are amazing.

They still have music most nights in the restaurant but I think the band may have changed but it's lovely to sit by the pool or on your verandah listening if you aren't eating in the restaurant.

The location is great too with bintang supermarket up the road one way not far and Double 6 the other way a few metres. Then can walk down double six to the beach and all the bars there to the right. Go take a beanbag seat, buy a drink and watch the sunset at Champlung bar which also has a great covers band from 6pm, its fantastic.

I still have another 2 nights here and wish it was more as its so nice and relaxing. Ash cloud please come back lol

Thanks 'The Haven' I will be back :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1194,A piece of Heaven right in the heart of Seminyak,50,July 2016,"Conviently located - Wonderful and very friendly staff - My fiancé and I choose a Pool Villa and were highly impressed - clean - comfortable - Butler - Private Pool - Air con works well - comfortable - outdoor and inside shower - Close to Bintang Supermarket - Breakfast is fantastic - Room service was great:

Negatives: The pizza was poor - 3pm check in is far too long - we actually checked in 4 rooms as we had friends and my sons checkin didn't not happen until 4pm.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1195,AMAZING!!!!,50,July 2016,Stayed here with the family and couldn't rave about it more !!! from service to rooms to food.... Such a lovely atmosphere!! My 15 year old daughter fell in love and i loved this experience for me and her. will be back,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1196,Jody,40,July 2016,"The Haven is located in Seminyak close to Bintang supermarket. The 2 bedroom apartment we had was spacious, clean, had inter connecting rooms, and was well set out. Staff went out of their way to make you feel welcome. Nothing was too much trouble. Great shopping on the street and walking distance to Legian. Would definitely stay here again. The 1 negative was check in was not until 3pm. We arrived at 12. But a great place to relax and stay.😊",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1197,Nice rooms but improvement needed,30,July 2016,"We were really impressed upon presentation of the hotel and our suite room, but after staying the previous 5 nights elsewhere, we found the service to be lacking and the mosquito problem not really acceptable. There were mosquitos in our room daily. We couldn't figure out where they were coming from until we noticed the gaps in the sliding doors to the balcony. The rooms don't have spray provided so you have to ask for it but room service is so slow!
When having breakfast downstairs by the pools with still water, people were swatting themselves constantly, mosquitos were everywhere. It wouldn't be much work to install a few waterfalls so the water moves to deter the mosquitos instead of offering mosquitos the perfect breeding ground. Little children we saw were literally covered in mozzie bites. Mosquito coils would probably help but there were none of those around. We had to cover ourselves in repellent just to go down for breakfast.
We wanted to heat up some meals we had on the stove but even though you have a stove in the suite, there are no cooking utensils or pans provided. We called room service to ask for it twice, but half an hour later no one showed up so we ended up going out to eat. Not sure how long it took them to arrive because we weren't there.
We would think twice before staying here again due to the discomfort of the mosquitos. The villa we stayed in elsewhere for the previous 5 days provided coils and spray and there was a waterfall at their pool so we hardly saw any mosquitos, The Haven was riddled with them.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1198,Good location & good service,40,July 2016,"I like this hotel very much, the experience at the front desk is very good.

I was very pleased that they upgraded my room to the suite building. Very nice room but there's one thing I didn't like is the mosquitos & the housekeeping.

They made me waited like 1 hour when I requested for the iron , ironing board & adaptors. I got to call the housekeeping again to check, they came & brought the wrong adaptors.

We end up buying our own instead from the convenience stall.

Overall I like staying here despite the little issue.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1199,Impressed,40,July 2016,"Our stay here was booked by our travel agent but we have been impressed. We are most impressed with the variety offered at breakfast and love the vegetable pancakes available. Coffee good too which hasn't always been at some places we've been in Bali and Flores to the east. It was my birthday while here and we returned to our room on the day to find a message and small cake wishing me a happy birthday. I was a little surprised they knew but then had a memory of having to add birth date to a form somewhere. Finally when we were notified of a delay in our home bound flight, we were able to add a night to our stay and even be in the same room.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1200,Nice stay...,30,January 2016,"Stayed as a family in a two-bedroom apartment with a full sized fridge and the ability to prepare meals (though not much equipment to do that) if you wanted to - but why? There was also a lounge room with a TV which was comfortable. The servicing of the rooms daily could be improved - we had to ask a number of times to have our rooms cleaned, though the sign was on the door. Our room was beautiful and cool. There are some general maintenance issues which can be addressed within the rooms as well - just minor issues.
Breakfast was included in our room rate. There are two breakfast areas - one at the entrance of the hotel and one by the pool - closer to the rear of the hotel. We were told there were two but nothing specific. When we had breakfast in the area at the front of the hotel they made you a 'real' coffee. So we decided that was where we would go the next day - which was fine until they tried to charge our coffees which we'd ordered to our room tab. When asked why the charge? We were told it was because this area was for short-term guests; we were not charged for our drinks but didn't go back to that area again. It was noisy anyway as it faces the front street.
The pool area is lovely and is shaded for a large part of the day which keeps the pool cool and refreshing on those nasty hot days. However, when it is 'busy' the poolside furniture is in demand and guests think they can 'reserve' their positions by leaving towels on recliners by the pool for hours. This needs to be supervised better.
The hotel is close to many shops either out the front of the hotel or behind the hotel and down the street are little shops and restaurants that were good for food as well as 24-hour shops to buy water.
Not a lot of information is given about the surrounding area - this could be improved for guests staying at this resort and of course better instruction of where guests can have breakfast, what's included in the price and any transport available to any local attractions.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1201,Not too impressed,30,July 2016,"A lot of things were wrong at this hotel. Air con was very loud and often didn't respond to changes on the remote, there were water marks and drips coming from where the air con was situated in the ceiling, the floor had cracks and mould and not to mention that the door to our room completely fell off the hinges! The lighting of the room was also terrible, and not much sunlight could come in through the window. Despite these negatives, I would definitely praise the upkeep of the gardens and pool as they were absolutely gorgeous. Spa was amazing also with lovely staff.

A good idea would be to spend a bit more money for a pool side suite or a villa as the cheapest rooms are rather average. Make sure to include breakfast with your room for about $10 extra a night as it is $12/pp every morning which is ridiculous.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1202,Would stay again,50,July 2016,"The service was excellent staff were very helpful accommodation was clean and had no issues with noise, like in Kuta,
Walk out the door and everything was close by shops supermarket and food 20 min walk to Kuta straight walk up the main road would stay here again for sure",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1203,Great to be back again!,50,June 2016,"We recently returned to The Haven for a second visit, after enjoying a wonderful experience the first time.
We weren't disappointed as the service, facilities and welcoming nature of the staff were again a pleasure to enjoy.
The suites here are very comfortable and enable a really relaxing experience in a prime location.
We will certainly return again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1204,Amazing visit!,50,July 2016,"I couldn't rate The Haven any higher! The staff are so welcoming and sweet! Our room was great! We had an obstructed pool view however we never used the balcony which was fine! The buffet breakfast!!!!! OMG sensational!! I found myself counting down the hours until I could have breakfast again!
We ate at the Sabeen restaurant quite a few times and ordered room service and the food was amazing! On our last night they had a buffet BBQ which was fantastic also! If you looking at staying somewhere that is friendly to your budget and also get the 5 star experience, I would recommend The Haven! Will deffinatly be staying here on my next visit!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1205,Outstanding,40,July 2016,"The name, The Haven, is apt as this property is a haven from the sometimes busy Bali scene. As soon as we walked into The Haven we felt welcomed by the very pleasant and super friendly staff. The Haven also gives the best of two worlds, having a bar overlooking the busy Seminyak road and another out the back near the suites in the quiet and laid back area overlooking the pool. The food here is good and the rooms are clean and tidy. If you're looking for somewhere to stay in Bali - don't go past The Haven!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1206,A lovely surprise!,50,July 2016,Stayed here as for the start and end of my dive trip. Both times we were offered room upgrades to suites which was larger and in a quieter region of the hotel. Nothing we did not like in the room - clean and fresh. The wow factor was the customer service which was amazing - each and every staff we met was all smiles and friendly! Will stay there again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1207,Second stay and will come back!,50,July 2016,"I guess my tittle said it all. This is our second time staying at their two bedroom suite. Love them, my kids love them too. Their coffee was great, i had to had 2 cups on my last day,just as indulgence. I tried their spa this time and fell asleep during the session, which is pretty rare for me. I was so relaxed and afterwards i felt refreshed. I'm curious to try their other spa treatments, well maybe next time.

Stay here, especially if you like seminyak area. I will definitely book this hotel again, next time i'm staying in seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1208,What a prize!!,50,July 2016,"We stayed at the Haven after winning a holiday to Bali through my husbands work. We upgraded to a suite which was lovely and spacious and a bit more comfortable then the standard room. There was nothing we didn't like about it. The staff were very friendly and always attentive. The breakfast catered for everyone, and dinners at the sateen restaurant were great Take some time out to say hi to the security staff, they do a great job, especially helping you across the street We hired a private driver, Comang Tock who took us sighttseeing, we recommend him if you need a driver. Overall a lovely relaxing trip,",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1209,One stay before leaving Bali,50,July 2016,"I hosted a yoga retreat in Ubud for 2 weeks from July 1-15. I then went to Seminyak after booking a night's stay at the Haven. My taxi driver asked around a few times where the hotel was and finally we got directed to it. I was assisted immediately with my luggage to the front desk, and the receptionist was very, very professional. My first impression was more than met!! She asked for a credit card, but I declined as my room was pre-booked. She smiled. I was so surprised when she told me I was upgraded to a suit. Man, oh man! I was. Not expecting what was in store on the upgrade. I was escorted to my room by one of the assist who would re-iterate everything from the pools and the times open; the restaurant and the times open. He was professional, and knowledgable about the hotel. Once I got to my room, I was in utter shock.

My upgrade: A huge master suite with a kitchen and stainless steel refrigerator. A huge living room with family sized sofas. Dual balcony looking over the dual pools. The bedroom was huge with a queen size bed with a modern stylized head board. The bedroom wall where the tv is has a nice backsplash of wood & tiles. There were two modern styled drop lights over the bed with just the right lighting to settle in bed for the night. The bedroom is separated from the bathroom with a thick frosted glass - enough to peer in yet enough privacy. In the bathroom is a deep sunken white tub perfect after a long drive. Just fill up with warm water and let your body release all the day's accumulated tension. Both decks looking over the twin pools have large sized day beds to lay out and read, relax or tan. This place is truly amazing with all modern amenities you find in a California million dollar home!! Thank you, Dear Professional Staff at The Haven. This is a must stay if you come to Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1210,Family hotel,40,June 2016,"The room size of this hotel is very suitable for family and equipped with appropriate tools for cooking. TV available in all bed room and dinning room. The location of this hotel is close to Seminyak Beach and Kuta Beach with decent rate. Unfortunately, the glass wall of the bathroom is not sufficient enough to hide people when taking a bath.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1211,Enjoyable,40,July 2016,"I came with my best friend and we stayed in one of the suites. They were lovely and more than big enough for two people. The balcony was especially lovely with two sections, one with a day bed great for some day time reading. The shower was in the bath which required a large step up and into so would not be good for older people or children. The pools were nice but small given the number of guests. They were often in the shade and there were only limited beds. There was lots of little ponds and steps around the resort which would make it hard if looking after small children or if u are elderly. The restaurants were nice and standard food. The breakfast was good too. I liked the location- short walk to double six beach, mini mart/circle k next door and a cheap massage place next door too. We had a very enjoyable stay and didn't need to go to far from the hotel if we didn't want to. Very enjoyable stay and relaxing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1212,Not impressed,30,July 2016,"We arrived last night to a room which was smelling terrible of mould. The receptionist did move us to the 3rd floor to a cleaner room. This is my first time in Bali, unimpressed by what I have seen. Streets dirty and crazy with scooters. The hotel is very impressive when u arrive but on the whole it is defo not 4 stars.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1213,Steer Clear,30,June 2016,"On arrival check in experience was fast but went downhill from there. Showed to our 2bd suite to have 2/3 A/C not working. One in living area blowing warm air, other in bedroom leaking water. Technician ""fixed"" leak only for it to pour out on other side after he'd left. Didn't look at living A/C until I called reception a third time. On fourth contact & after 2.5 hours, I requested another room & was moved from 3rd floor to ground floor. If you have small children, the balconies are off limits. The barriers are ladders and a medium sized child will fit through the lattice. Resort photos look beautiful but pools are cold due to buildings around them not allowing the sun down to warm them. Shower/bath combo leaked through a crack in the floor which both my husband & I slipped in. Breakfast buffet is good. Spa experience was nice & reasonably priced. Hotel was well located. Staff were all lovely but seems all too young & could do with some senior staff managing things. I'd avoid this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1214,Great location for some,40,July 2016,"Whilst conveniently located on Jl Raya, access to shops is excellent, it is a noisy/busy location. In particular the restaurant, Sabeen, is located right on the roadside. So if you want a quiet peaceful dining experience this is not the place to go. We had the buffet breakfast each morning, the range is good and the Indonesian/Asian breakfast items are delicious. The rooms are a little old but clean. The pools are quiet shady, which is good for those of us who tend to burn easily in the sun. The shade does make them a little cool. Staff are wonderful, helpful and cheerful and really made the stay enjoyable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1215,The Haven - a piece of heaven,40,July 2016,"We booked a 1 bedroom villa with pool and this has been the quietest place so far in Bali. The decor is gorgeous ( the bathroom!) and due to the size of the villa, you could spend days inside quite happily. No barking dogs or motor bikes revving along back streets in the early hours. Fantastic location 5 min walk to beach and shops along Jalan Raya Seminyak. Service was incredible. The staff could not do enough. We had a few maintenance issues due to the torrential rain on the first day and this was fixed instantly... My only tiny complaint was the price of the resorts car - this has tripled since last time but as taxis are so readily available, this was not really an issue...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1216,Good last minute choice,40,July 2016,"We ended up having to cancel our trip the previous month and reschedule. At short notice The Haven was all we could get for a reasonable price with the space we needed as travelling with a 3yr old.
The location is great, plenty of shopping nearby, places to eat and very close to the Bintang supermarket.
Grounds are beautifully kept, lovely to walk through (it's a very long property, suites at the back, villas middle and rooms front). The back entry was very handy for popping out the side road of the hotel.
We stayed in a one bedroom suite, perfect for our family of 3. Large living, dinning kitchen area & large balcony with daybeds.
Breakfast was good, room service fine also. Mosquitos were manageable in room. Staff very friendly.

The things they could improve on:
•Staff were less attentive around the pool than I'm used to - I had to wander up each time to where they were all hanging out and order drinks.
•We had 2 or 3 times where our room keys wouldn't work and had to go to reception to have them reset.
•The first day we were there, the front of the air-conditioner nearly fell off and was left hanging in such a way a door couldn't open. (This was fixed ASAP)
•The in-room safe wouldn't open a few days in and a staff member had to come and fix it to open.
•The suite pools are just so cold, as they don't get a lot of sun to warm them.
•There are no loungers next to the kids pool.

I'm a pretty tolerant person and understand things go wrong and believe it's how problems are dealt with that shows the true colours of an establishment. All incidents were handled quickly with apologies and the outcomes were fine.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1217,Comfortable Hotel!,40,June 2016,"I recently stayed at The Haven in Seminyak. During our stay, we were in a suite which was very spacious and neatly designed! The service was impeccable, the staff were very kind and patient. The buffet breakfast was adequate but nothing extraordinary. The location was pretty good as it was surrounded by different shops and restaurants (I would recommend checking out this restaurant called Grain for dinner one night) They also provided shuttles to the beach but they were a little infrequent (only 4 times a day), but it wasn't very far away so we often just walked or took a taxi which are very inexpensive. The only thing that really bothered me was that for some reason our room cards would sometimes not work. We had to constantly go down to reception and recode them which was a big pain! Also, the water in the pools were very cold (even way way colder than the beach) But nothing big at all! I throughly enjoyed my stay here and would consider revisiting the hotel if we decided to come to Bali again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1218,Aptly named!!,40,June 2016,"This really is a haven in the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, Bali. After battling with the traffic and shops, it was lovely to come back to your beautiful air conditioned room or to laze by one of the amazing pools. We had a one bedroom suite, which was huge and serviced daily. Very neat and tidy. Short walk to the beach and lots of shops on your doorstep if that's what you want. Staff were very helpful with any requests we had.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1219,"Great place, great value",40,June 2016,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Haven. The room was gigantic for the price we paid through Agoda, we stayed in a one bedroom suite. Breakfast was nice and complete. Some details in the room could have been better taking care of like the cleanliness and attention to craftsmanship is certain areas of the room.

The location is great. Walking distance to the beach and great restaurants.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1220,Lovely hotel on busy road,40,February 2016,"We loved this hotel including the service, the room was huge, bathroom really nice. The pool was clean and not crowded when we went.
We visited in Feb 2016.
Only downside which didn't really affect us was that the hotel was located on a busy road. You couldn't hear traffic noise from the room or pool though.
Drinks were very expensive!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1221,Short fun trip,40,June 2016,"Stay there only for short visit, two night just for weekend gateway..
Breakfast is nice, room clean although there is an ants on last day in bathroom.
Swimming pools is nice located outdoor
But if you prefer quiet one better choose suit or villa
Didn't get a chance to try the hotel beach club due to heavy rain almost all day
Hotel nearby with 24h minimarket and craft stores",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1222,Good for shopping,40,June 2016,"We stayed at the Haven last week for a couple of nights . If you want to be close to the shopping then this is the place . The traffic can be really busy so wait for a security guard to stop traffic if you need to cross the road. The rooms are comfortable we had to step into the bath to use the shower which was nice as it was a large overhead type . Complimentary water available and good selection of toiletries . Has a safe .
Staff all very friendly . We did however try to call reception at 11pm one night where we couldn't get through as it wS constantly engaged . Wifi was pretty good . Pool was quite cold not a lot of sun as surrounded by the hotel buildings , could have been. Few more dun lounges . ATMA spa in the hotel was just gorgeous ! We paid $55 Australian for a Balinese massage and facial . Recommended to have this !! Breakfast was included and a wide selection was available .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1223,The villa is great,50,June 2016,"We are staying in a one bed villa now, for four days. The room is not new, but is in very good condition. The air conditioning is good and works well, the stupid electric toilet works good, but it amuses me that someone has installed such a thing, that lifts and closes the lid for you, and flushes it as well. The butler service does a turndown and sprays the rooms for mosquitos in the evening. I have found a few mosquitos in the bathroom, but no bites.
Breakfast is in the restaurant, or in the villa for about $45 per couple, extra. There is plenty to eat at the breakfast, and of reasonable quality.
The staff are very friendly, always saying good morning or afternoon. The one time that I couldn't get the internet to work, a it guy was in my room within five minutes to rectify the problem, I was entering the incorrect password, all smiles, "" you are welcome, sir"", stupid me. The wi-fi is free, and fast, and I have only had to reconnect once in the last three days, but then the villas have a modem each.
Each villa has a private pool, just the correct temperature, in June, for an early morning or late night skinny dip. There is an outdoor shower, as well as a regular big indoor shower. Around the pool there are loungers as well as a dining setting, but beware of the mosquitos. The hotel does fogging on a Thursday evening, so plan to be out.
There is an office desk in the rooms as well as a fully equiped kitchen, if you want to cook in the room. We have not needed to use the two public pools in the hotel, we are lucky enough to have our own.
We have not tried the hotel restraunts, apart from breakfast, as there are so many great eateries out on busy Jalan Seminyak, or a short taxi ride away, on eat street.
Overall we are enjoying our stay at the Haven, and have no complaints about anything.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1224,Very poor service,10,June 2016,Room is not nice at all. Air conditioning is not working. Really hot. Slow response.. i consider not to take this hotel for another vacation. Very noisy with music downstair. Very very disappointing. Pillow is so hard..,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1225,Nice and clean,30,June 2016,"Fairly nice rooms, great pool (but often in the shade). I didn't love the breakfast and the location is fine but you need to get a taxi to the main part of seminyak (you pay only around $2-7). I liked the little shuttle jeep to the beach, but was infrequent. Nice balconies, the beach club was handy too.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1226,All that glitters is not gold,30,June 2016,"When we arrived for our 4 night stay that had been booked 8 weeks before, our room was gone. We were given a room that smelled musty and the floor still had food stuck to it. Also two single beds. Second day we were moved to a better room with queen bed. Most staff were good, but some a little sour faced. Rarely found pool bar attendants late in arvo!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1227,We have had a wonderful stay,50,June 2016,"We have had a wonderful stay. The staff have been so polite and obliging. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was fantastic. Breakfast was great, hotel surrounds great, beach club great. Club benefits was a nice way to meet and socialise with other guests. Also did a yoga class. Would easily stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1228,Good location but not good service,20,June 2016,"Good point
*The location is good for shopping as you can walk
Bintan market walking by 5 mins.
* The staff who was in club lounge was very helpful and nice.

Bad point
*The food of club lounge was not ripped. (Maybe its dry season?)
*There is narrow and complicated building and its hard to approach the room for the first time.
*We have some problem about the room but the staff was inflexible.
We did not feel the staff was faithful.
We never stay again this hotel and we don't recommend our friends even the location and some reviews are good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1229,"Great position ,large suites. Needs to cath up with smoking protocols.",40,May 2016,"It was our second time at the Haven, we booked a Haven Suite as before.
Suites are 95 sm about three times a normal hotel room size. very good facilities in room.
Large bedroom, good size lounge .Full size fridge in kitchen, dining room. Sun beds on both balconies overlooking pool.
Down side is bathroom , very large bath ,but shower in bath, not separate, very difficult and quite risky to get out of shower when floor wet. Not suitable for older visitors or any one not reasonably agile.
Breakfast very good in a in nice outdoor environment.

One thing that could be improved here is, apart from the main restaurant there appear to be no regulations on smoking being observed. So sitting having a great breakfast it was common or some person to light up at the next table. We were there nine nights and it was inconvenient having to move tables to avoid the smokers. It was rare in Bali for smokers to show any respect or manners, and think about others, Which therefore means The hotel has to be responsible for the comfort of all guests, many of whom nowadays are non smokers .They need some smoking protocols.

That being said, it is a hotel with great service, friendly staff, it is in a brilliant position close to amenities, with shuttle buses to the beach every hour till five pm.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1230,No no no,10,June 2016,"It isn't gorgeous, it isn't beautiful, it isn't safe. It's dirty, dangerous and run down. We had rats on the balcony, cockroaches in the doorways and black mould around the bathtub. The paths and slippery walkways are death traps waiting for injuries. The management are unwilling to address concerns and not willing to help when problems occur.
The general manager who responds to criticisms on this site was no where to be seen when we had a serious injury from negligence at this hell hole. Despite 6 requests to speak to him, he never materialised. The staff we did see sported badges reading ""everyone matters"". When questioned they said that was referring to the staff and wasn't meant for the guests. Never truer word was spoken. Don't go there. The worst Hotel I have ever stayed in. There are thousands of better options in Bali that won't put your health at risk",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1231,"Big Room, Best Location, Good Service, Good Price",40,June 2016,"Big Room, Best Location, Good Service, Good Price. I stayed for 2 nights at the One Bedroom Suite. Room is very spacious, clean and comfortable. However, room was like having very thin wall. From the room I could clearly hear people walking and talking in the hall way, or I could clearly hear my next door guests talking all night long.
Staffs were friendly and try to cater to your requirements. Since it is the month of Ramadhan, I requested that breakfast was to be delivered to my room at 3:30 AM, and both times they were delivered on time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1232,"Great Facilities, Average Rooms",30,June 2016,"I read mixed reviews about The Haven so didn't know what to expect. While the location is good and the facilities are pretty, the hotel needs a lot of maintenance. The first room we were shown to smelt like mould, and there was water dripping from the rusty air conditioner. We asked to change and the only other room they had available was not much better. The rooms we were shown were small and dark, but luckily we didn't intend to spend much time in them. The toilet also blocked after every single use which was frustrating.
While the pool was picturesque, my partner cut his foot on the bottom quite badly due to some tiles being chipped. The hotel maintenance staff were very quick to fix it, and took good care of him. The air conditioner also didn't work in the gym, making it unusubale, but again they fixed it quickly.
The positives were that the staff were welcoming, kind and very lovely and the grounds are beautiful, but most importantly the beach club is perfect. Overall we had a great time, however if I returned I'd probably spend a little more and stay at one of the hotels right on the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1233,"Great hotel,would easily stay again",40,May 2016,"Great Villas and suites, friendly staff and good for children, close to the beach and some pretty good eateries close by. Central location and easy walking distance to either Garlic Lane in Legian or Ultimo in Seminyak",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1234,Only place we stay in Seminyak/Legian,40,March 2016,"Beautiful hotel, suites are ideal with plenty of room for everything. Breakfast every morning is great. Perfect location, walking distance to Bintang supermarket, market stalls, beach, great restaurants.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1235,Great location and even better accommodation,50,May 2016,"This is a great hotel in Seminyak, close to the beach and the centre of town. The staff were amazing, and extra helpful. The rooms are very clean with all amenities. Thank you for making my stay so good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1236,A gem! Love this place!,50,May 2016,"A great resort to stay in. Staff very friendly (as all Balinese are), nothing was too hard for them. Great location, and plenty of eateries around. 500m from the beach, and close to shopping. A great stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1237,Good service and comfy,50,May 2016,"We stayed in the suites for 3 nites and got the room on the second floor. The staff was very friendly and the room is clean. They also have different pools between suites and hotel. So if we want to relax on the pool or just go for a swim it's never crowded. The food service is great because they offer 24hr service and the taste is quite good. The only recommendation i would give to the hotel is for them to do a little fine tuning as to the rooms,i.e: cracked tiles, walls, some of the wood panels, etc.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1238,Roomy apartment,30,June 2016,"We come to Bali 5 times a year and stay in many different hotels/villas. Any regular Bali visitors will know how many villas/hotels are bring opened every day.
This is our 3rd visit to the Haven Suites since they opened about 10 years ago. The apartments are great if you want that extra space that a hotel room can't offer. The apartments are great, separate living space large bedroom and bathroom. Spaces are getting tired but still are nice and comfortable. Beach Club is great, having a space at the beach to chill on a pool lounge with staff is great.

Sorry but there are some negatives, our checkin experience by the gentleman on the 14th was terrible. He was unfriendly, didn't smile once, we had to drag our luggage up the stairs while security staff and hotel staff watched on.
None of the facilities were explained at checkin. I only found out about the beach club by the web. Nothing was explained, breakfast, pool, gym, restaurant, nothing.
Air con in our bedroom doesn't work properly. Asked 3 times and it still doesn't work! Decided to give up!

The pool is freezing! All hotels I have stayed in have them heated and the pool area is in the shade 24 hours. If you want a tan, head to the beach.
If you get a good room and don't have to ask the staff for anything, you will have a great stay.
We went water skiing one day in Nusa Dua (highly recommended) and asked the pool attended if we could take 2 pool towels with us. He said yes no problem. We got to the front of the hotel (the second pool) and were stopped interrogated and told no! Seriously sort your procedures out Haven and don't embarrass your customers.
Doubt very much we will be back, but it will suit some people.
Oh yeah, breakfast staff are friendly, but the area is crowed and not we'll presented, food is ok but limited.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1239,Clean comfortable stay in Seminyak,40,May 2016,"Definitely recommend The Haven for a good home base hotel in Seminyak. Close to the beach and the heart of downtown. Very affordable, clean, and comfortable. Also had a good experience at the spa!

There are many places to stay in Seminyak but would definitely consider The Haven again. Ideal for the first few nights of a trip to Bali to get oriented.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1240,The haven,50,November 2015,"Clean rooms, beautiful pool and great staff...close to the beach and free access to beach umbrellas and seats! Breakfast with many choices and the restaurant offers a variety of Asian and European dishes",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1241,Great hotel and staff,40,May 2016,"Really nice hotel, great staff and the food in the restaurant was the best we had and it was really sweet on my sisters birthday they brought up a lil cake to her room!

The location was also really good just a small walk to the beach and lots of shops.

Only criticism is we went in the pool at 10pm and the security guard kicked us out saying it closed at 9pm.. It would be nice if this information was written in the rooms. Everything else was great :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1242,My last visit to Bali,30,June 2016,"Over the years I have visited Bali many times and had never been to Seminyak. I picked Haven in Seminyak because the advertising described it as ""upmarket"" with plenty of quality dining and entertainment nearby.Well this is drawing a very long bow indeed! I stayed 7 days, room not up to expectations, hotel unwilling or unable to meet expectations,pool life dead, two lots of Bali belly from nearby restaurants, attempted rip off by taxi drivers,local convenience store, money changer. Streets filthy and grey water river/ drain runs onto local beach, I could go on but tourists will keep coming to have there own experiences. I do like the Bali people but I ask why does every second shop have to display out front wooden and chrome dildoes by the hundreds? Who buys all these?",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1243,Super classy,50,May 2016,This placed was unexpectedly amazing. Kind of a last minute booking on a great deal... You come in off the hustle and bustling street and can relax in the tranquility that is the haven. Some how they made it super cool temperature wise which is something you appreciate in the heat of bali. Also if you can get a deal with breakfast buffet included you totes should,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1244,Great Location and Ambience,50,September 2015,"Love this hotel for its location and ambience. We got room with pool view. The room is spacious. They have a nice large pool. I can spend hours only in the pool.
It also located in the center of Legian. Perfect for a shopping addict like me ;)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1245,Not as good as the big resorts but very comfortable room,40,May 2016,"Pros
Very comfortable room - stayed in the superior 1 bdrm suite
3 pools surrounded by nice landscaping
Spa looked nice approx 175k but didn't try
Breakfast was decent, good range of food
Good location in Seminyak - on Main Street and 10 min walk to beach
Modern hotel - better for couples than families
Family stayed in a villa with its own pool which was also very comfortable

Cons
Better for couples - we booked thinking it had a kids club but it doesn't
Checkin was a bit shaky - not as warm a welcome as the big resort we came from in Nusa Dua
Breakfast area was a little cramped but ok

Overall - modern nice hotel in Seminyak but if you have just come from a large resort in Nusa Dua like we had, you will be left a little unimpressed with hotel and service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1246,Great hotel,40,May 2016,"Stayed here three nights in a one bedroom suite, room was huge and over looking the pool, very beautiful gardens, the staff are friendly but not as attentive as some places I've stayed in Bali. All in all was very nice. No kids club which is a shame, but in a good location, beds are a little hard.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1247,Pretty Decent,40,May 2016,"A nice place to stay. Close to shopping, short stroll to the beach. The pools are nice. All staff are very friendly and it is a very good place to be with young children, they are all very accomodating. The breakfast provided is excellent and I would definitely recommend it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1248,Modern look concept but nothing spectacular,40,June 2015,"I stayed with my family for two nights. The hotel concept was modern look. We booked interconnecting and pool view rooms. The room was a bit small and shower room was bit slippery. We asked for the staff's help but the response was a bit late.

We love the pool. The water was fresh and clean. The breakfast menu was also various and nice.The location was also perfect as it is within walking distance to restaurant, bars, shops, etc.

Overall, it was a good stay but price doe",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1249,busy street,30,May 2016,"The staff are excellent, very friendly, nothing is to much trouble, breakfast is good, pool good for adults and children. The room was clean, but a little bit dated, needed a bit of maintenance. Service was a bit slow when ordering drinks. Wi - fi was very ordinary.Overall it was ok. Hence the average rating.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1250,Excellent stay!,50,May 2016,"Clean, comfortable, centrally located within walking distance to shops, bars, spas and restaurants. They also have an excellent spa with affordable treatment and packages - a real treat! I would happily book this hotel again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1251,Well chosen name....truly a haven,50,January 2016,"Having stayed in this hotel on several occasions I would highly recommend a stay for friends and family. My experience each time has been extremely positive, both in terms of service and facilities.

I do much prefer the suites and the breakfast/pool area provided for them. However, I should quality that by stating it is probably due to my age. Our group enjoyed the tranquility of the suites as well as the enormous space they provided.

Check in was swift and professional. Staff, at all times were excellent. As is the case in all Bali hotels in my experience. Breakfast was outstanding with a wide variety of choices, both freshly cooked and pre-prepared.

The pool was gorgeous. Plenty of huge sun lounges. My one concern for The Haven was the decking surrounds - it is truly in desperate need of replacement.

I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant due to the wealth of choice in the immediate surrounds.
Loved the location for shopping and eating.

Price was excellent too.

Definitely worth serious consideration for Bali accomodation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1252,Friendly and cheap,50,December 2015,"Haven providing restaurant and rent car plus driver, the parking area is so large, the room is clean and cozy,
The pool also clean, great place to stay, the receiptionist are friendly and helpfull, we can see the pool from the receiptionist room,",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1253,Real life is different from the pictures. Disappointed,20,May 2016,"I just check in 1 hour ago and I am already looking forward to check out tomorrow.
1) There are 2 lifts but only 1 working.
2) The staff did not explain much about the amentities. I have to ask almost everything myself e.g. breakfast, mini bar....
3) The room has a weird smell. And the floor is dirty. The remote controls, tables and all is very oily and feels dirty.
4) Air con cannot adjust, only set at 26?
5) WIFI DAMN POOR

The photos in the website looks polished, clean, comfy and resort feel, but I don't feel it is. I am really shocked.

I really thought the room and the entire experience will turn out like what others travellers described, but I was shocked.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1254,didnot get what we paid for,30,April 2016,Room was good and of a large size ( suite). communicating with the staff was difficult and a family member had to wait far too long for his room. in fact the staff did not inform us when the room was ready we had to keep checking on it.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1255,I'm sure there are places to stay,20,May 2016,"Stayed for 4 nights - Thurs to Monday in Room 2007. Room was terribly smelly and air con wasn't working properly. Had to change room keys four times in one day as they would only work once, really annoying having to go up and down to reception. After 3 nights of very little sleep due to smell and stuffiness of room and much complaining I was moved to Room 0118 at the back of the hotel which was better but still only average. No electrical socket near mirror and room lights very dim. Breakfast was fine, nothing special for the price. Location good and staff nice. Hotel is just old and needs a good refurb. Gardens and landscaping lovely.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1256,"Good for a short stay, staff very friendly",50,May 2016,"Only stayed 1 night (and my friend 2) before we went elsewhere in Bali, for the price I think this place is a great choice. The rooms were nice, some noise from bar area and pool filtered in but stopped by about 10pm. The pool was a nice area, there is another pool back n the villas section which would be more secluded I would imagine but didn't use it myself, set back from street and the breakfast was nice- even had peanut butter and vegemite available! Across the road is an ATM, next door is a minimart, and next to that a great massage/beauty spa place. Didn't walk to the beach but would be about 10-15mins, or they have a beach club linked with hotel. Would stay here again if only for a few nights but if spending a week or so wanting a resort style holiday then maybe go a bigger resort style hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1257,Nice hotel but drinks are extortionately priced,30,April 2016,"Nice clean room and pool area, good location close to shops and restaurants and 10-15 min walk to the beach.
Unfortunately me and my husband got very ill after eating the buffet breakfast which lasted for 4 days and we had to change our plans. Not impressed!!! Also don't bother buying any drinks by the pool as the prices are ridiculous! £5 for a cocktail!!

If you are staying in this hotel I suggest avoiding the breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1258,Great value,40,April 2016,The Haven is a great value hotel! I was lucky enough to be upgraded on arrival to a pool side suite. It was so roomy and the noise from the pool didn’t carry and disturb me in my room. The in room dining left a lot to be desired but that would be my only negative comment.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1259,Touring Romantis,50,May 2016,"After had a long journey, from surabaya to bali (by motorcylce), we're so tired.. and i ask with my bestfriend, where is hotel we can stay for 2 nights, that have a good price and place? my friend choose The Haven Bali.
Here is good place, good environment, good weather, good view. Our plan just stay for 2 nights, is extend for 1 nights again. Because its feels like home. So we wont to go out from here. Hehehe..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1260,"Fantastic Stay, highly recommend",50,April 2016,"I had a 10 night stay in a 2 bedroom suite with my wife and 2 daughters (11 and 8). The suite is HUGE with heaps of room and great amenities. Beds extremely comfortable and TV/DVD etc work well. Fantastic WiFi service.
Breakfast is absolutely fantastic, great selection of foods and the staff are extremely attentive (I loved the French toast!!). All the staff were very friendly and nothing was ever a hassle
We swam in both the pools - the fun pool (as my kids called it) had a basketball ring and balls to play with and the suite pool a little bit smaller and more quiet. The hotel offers morning exercises by the pool 4 days a week (yoga, pilates, stretching) which my wife enjoyed immensly.
Yes the rooms are slightly dated ( cracked tiles and marked surfaces in the kitchen etc) but the issues are very much far and few between.

Only 2 very small gripes
1. We had to get the room keys to our rooms changed almost on a daily basis as the magnetic strip ceased to open the door
2. The lighting in the en suite bathroom to the main bedroom and the 2nd bedroom is not quite adequate, rooms are a little dark

All in all though a fantastic hotel. We had a brilliant stay and we would definitely came back to stay at the very friendly and reasonably priced Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1261,No service,20,May 2016,Room full of defects. Restaurant for dinner is a total disaster with no service sequence and guests upset everywhere. Wake up at 7am in the morning by a guy cleaning the pond in front of all the rooms...hotel seems busy with always heavy traffic in front due to crossroad. Beach still far.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1262,Great facilities and location,40,April 2016,"the hotel is located in the heart of Seminyak with a shorty distance to double 6 Beach and Bintang shop , the staff are very friendly and helpful and after facing an issue with the A/C in our room they upgraded us to a suite, the breakfast was very good with many drink options.

The deluxe rooms are not up to standard but the suites are perfect.

My recommendation if you staying here is to go for the suites",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1263,We loved it here in our suite,50,June 2015,Originally we were staying in kuta but decided to stay in Seminyak instead we booked in by our travel agent our suite was lovely the only whinge I would have is that the bathroom was a bit smelly mould smell and a few ants in the kitchen but suite was clean everything you needed close to everything breakfast was just lovely staff very attentive if you have the money i would upgrade to a villa we had a look but couldn't quite afford it the villas are just beautiful and very private.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1264,"Good location, average service, quite disappointed",20,May 2016,"We stayed at the Haven for a few days with our kids and friends. Booked 2 suites, they were kind enough to grant our request to have rooms close to each other. Although I was quite disappointed when were checking in on the first day. It was a very hot afternoon and we happened to arrive about an hour and a half earlier than the appointed check-in time which was at 3pm. I was with my wife and two sons, one is 2 and half years old and the other is still 4 months old.
We were told that our rooms will be ready in an hour and a half. So I asked the staff at reception to prioritize one of the 2 suites I booked so that we can get in to one of them since we have an infant with us. Yet, we ended up having had to wait for the entire hour and a half to be able to get into our room.. And to top it all off another couple that checked in after us got to get into their suite way earlier than us.
I was very disappointed that I was not prioritised since I arrived earlier than them... And plus I had an infant with me... If I were only with my wife.. I would not complain much... But this is a completely different story. They don't seem to get that I did not need both rooms to be ready right away... My kids needed to rest and they didn't seem to care much about our well being as guests.

Location of this hotel is good, facilities are good. Room condition was average, breakfast was average.. I don't think I will be coming back to stay because of the experience I received when checking in.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1265,Possibly Best Hotel in Seminyak,40,April 2016,"If you're staying in Seminyak, this hotel is definitely worth staying at. The reasons are obvious:

- Centrally located among many shops so you can dine, have good massages (choose Kimberly Spa just across the hotel), and walk to shops such as Religion for some street wear/ unique designs.
- Free access to The Haven's Beach Club (there's a shuttle bus that takes guests to and fro the club).
- Strong wifi for your business or leisure needs.
- Great environment, blending modern chic and Balinese. Plus, there are two pools.

The not so yay reasons are:

- Not walking distance to Seminyak Square.
- Staff are not so friendly.
- Welcome drink tastes like diluted fruit punch.

Since we didn't opt for breakfast, we can't comment on it.

The whole place is actually huge. From the entrance, that's hard to tell until you walk in. We looked around for other hotels that could be on par with Haven but we were convinced to stay here for all our nights in Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1266,Disappointing,30,March 2016,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was situated right at the far end of what is a very large property, it was a long walk from the main hotel entrance to our room and given we had elderly family with us this was not ideal, especially given the hot weather in March. The suite was very spacious and had a nice balcony overlooking one of the pools . The however the kitchen was not at all well appointed ( 2 plates, 2 glasses etc.) and the bathroom seemed particularly tired. breakfast was fair & staff were very friendly and helpful though I though it was odd that when we were checking out they sent someone to check the room and the minibar in case we had ""forgotten"" anything. This sends a very poor message in my book. Would not return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1267,Great place to stay,50,April 2016,"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff and very central location. We walked to the seminyak square shoping square one day, the Kuta shoping centre next day. 15 mins walk to beach and so many places to eat on the beach. Bean bags and sunsets. $30 nz dollars buys you drink and tea. Hotel has two lovely pools and lovely restaurant. Amazing selection for breakfast. Highly recommend this place.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1268,"Nice Hotel, Friendly Staff but Dirty",30,April 2016,"Located at heavy traffic area, check in and out is good, they upgrade me to suite room which is far and complicated walking distance and far.

Huge suite room. Comfortable bed and very clean bedsheets. Nice balcony looking at swimming pool and other buildings. Nice view

The things is design of the room not macth from one to others, the shower room very dirty, amenities was wet cause of the leaked sink. Lots of bugs and ant. When I request to move to other room, the response is very nice but facing same problems , dirty and bugs. Found ashes of cigarettes. They didn't clean at all after the guest before me was checked out. Under the bed was plastic garbage. Never experienced. Can't wait to move out

Such a pity, I suppose to be happy with their kindness upgrade my room, such a pity that they have excellent facilities , super nice 3 different swimming pool and spa. But I don't bother to try consider to the cleanest.

The food at restaurants is not bed but overpriced

Never come back. But recommend for buget travelers who want to enjoy the facility and gets upgrade to suite room, and like to walk around in Bali pedestrian, because it's best location for Shopping.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1269,First visit was pretty good and second visit was just average.,30,July 2015,"My first visit at the Haven was pretty good, but my second visit was just average.

The biggest homework for the hotel management would be service excellence (in my opinion). Check-in and check-out were the biggest hassle in my second visit, while these 2 points are the one that you remember the most in your experience with the hotel because it is the entry point and the exit point.

The check in was inefficient, especially when there are multiple guests at the check-in counter. It seems that the staff are overwhelmed with the amount of queries, and had trouble communicating with the team. It took me almost half an hour to get check in many hotels check in will take only for about 5 minutes.

Check out was rather similar. I had arranged an airport transfer the night before my departure date, but things were falling apart and unprepared, making me anxious of missing my flight.

It is too bad because during the length of stay, the experience was pretty good. I had a nice room, with a beautiful pool view. The pool is pleasant and it's nice to walk around in the hotel complex to the very back. The design of the whole hotel complex still brings nature close to you so if you like trees and Balinese flavour like me, you will enjoy walking around the hotel.

Housekeeping can be improved because the cleanliness standard is between average and below average.

Value adjustment needs to be made while the hotel is not living up to the expectations. When it was first opened, the price was very competitive, and they managed to deliver above average value and experience. As time goes by, the price hiked up, but the value and experience were declining.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1270,love the suite room,40,December 2015,"This is my late review, as I stayed end of December, 2015.
I was so excited when it was peak season for Bali, I still got a room and plus a free upgrade to a suite type which is very lovely and very spacious. When you stay in a suite room, you need view walk.. because the building is different from the standard hotel rooms or villas, here there is a separate pool and an area for breakfast. There are lounges that can be enjoyed limited.

Overall i really like this hotel, I like the landscape design. Crew is friendly and the service also okay...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1271,dont stay here perth prices and rooms are dirty air cons dont work,20,April 2016,"Hi i recently stayed at the haven in seminyak checked into my room at 1am, the air con was not working and leaking water the bathroom was filthy covered in mould and calcified shower screen. i went down to reception right away to report and was told they are fully booked and i couldnt be moved to the next day so no sleep and a hot night. surfice to say i was moved the next day but again the room was sub standard. also the prices are extremely high for bali 2 bintangs cost $16.00 with tax ridiculous its bali. Again on our last night the air con was blowing hot air control panel wouldnt go below 26 degrees it was cooler outside again i rang reception, they sent maintenance man that couldnt understand what we where saying. Overall i wont be returning to the haven and i will be advising friends and family of my expereince.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1272,"Haven - Heaven of misinformation, miscommunication .....",20,March 2016,"Here are the points
1. Reception staff is extremely poor in communication and lethargic in responding queries. I had to put my queries at least 3 times before a solution provided. Despite informing prior to even check in, the reception staff didn't arrange for my transfer to the airport on the last day. I had to wink and exhibit disgust (which I hate to) to get my work done.

2. The hotel team should sent an email prior to check in day seeking additional/special requests if any from the patrons.

3. I was charged $xx before check in as 'security deposit'. I was told that this is for bills during my stay. Surprisingly I still had to pay my outstanding bill around $50 while they could have deducted the amount from my deposit. The 'Security Deposit' is yet to come back and I was not even informed about how and when will be re-credited.

4. The cleaning service was poor, we found a tiny lizard below the TV during check out.

5. It was raining one afternoon and a gap in the balcony sliding doors let it all in. We had to call the cleaning team to wipe it off again and again till the rain stopped.

In all I won't stay in a property like this again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1273,Not a quiet haven,30,April 2016,"Staff very friendly but the hotel is very tired and needs to be updated. I had a superior room but little space to unpack my clothes. Floor was cracked and there was mould in the bathroom. Hotel was noisy, so I did not get my quiet trip away. I did enjoy the spa at the hotel, it was very restful and quiet.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1274,Our Haven in Bali,50,April 2016,"We decided to finally stay at this hotel as we had been passed it so many times and the location is perfect. We stayed in a one bedroom villa which was enormous. We had a sitting room, bedroom, study, huge wardrobe, atrium garden an inside and outdoor shower, bathtub, double vanity, 3 split system aircons which included one in the bathroom so you didn't sweat whilst applying your makeup and to top it off a self flushing, seat warming toilet.
Our room was serviced twice a day with fresh towels and water. We had an amazing large pool surrounded by lushes greenery and very quiet. The villas are situated away from the main hotel right near the spa where you could get all sorts of pampering.
To top it all off we got a 50% discount as it was off peak. So all in all a truly wonderful holiday. Can thoroughly recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1275,"Lovely, but definitely not 4 star.",30,April 2016,"Ok so my first impression as I walked in to the lobby I thought it was beautiful and the staff were very welcoming. Then I saw my room - it was relatively clean however very run down! A lot of the tiles were cracked, the fan in the bathroom hanging out, the aircon had been ripped out and replaced but not patched up, definitely in need of a fresh coat of paint and some brighter lights. In saying this these things don't bother me if I was paying a little less and not expecting a 4 star hotel (lucky I didn't pay full rates). Not sure if all rooms are like this, maybe some of the more expensive rooms are in better condition not sure. Will post some photos as well to show what I'm talking about.
Another thing was the breakfast, can't say that was 4 star either, definitely not bad but just not 4 star.
The pool areas are lovely and the staff are very friendly, don't know if I'd stay here again when I know of plenty of other places close by in the same price bracket that are in a lot better condition.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1276,"Great location, just didn't live up to expectations",30,April 2016,"I've been to Bali many times, and always wanted to try The Haven, it looks so cool from the street. But it really wasn't cool. I don't know if it was because I got a last minute cheap deal, but I felt like I was being treated like the cheap customer I was! I got a room almost right next to reception which meant I heard the phones ringing loudly the whole time , as well as through the connecting door to the next room...but much much worse was the very loud singer ('entertainment') that went on till 10 o'clock at night. There was one person in the restaurant listening at 9o'clock, but on it went. It was a Monday night, so not just a Saturday night thing. The food in the restaurant was good, I had a light lunc, plus the breakfast was fantastic. The restaurant staff were also very good. But there are plenty of eating and shopping options along this street, you'll never be short of a great meal! We love Warung Ocha (turn left out of hotel and up to corner with Jl ChamplungTanduk), or turn left at the same corner and go to Mozzarella, OMG sooo good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1277,"Tired rooms but nice hotel,",30,April 2016,"We stayed for 4 nights and upon first inspection of the room i was very disappointed. The first thing i noticed was all the cracked floor tiles. Then the stains on the kitchen bench. The arms on the chair had something spilled on them and the mirror looked it like had snot on it.
A corner of the room is dedicated to a kitchen, but there are no pots or pans at all. just a big empty waste of space kitchen, weird.
We had a ground floor suite. About 6am the housekeeping start trundling around. Be warned it is very loud in the room 919. As well as the noise of people going to breakfast. Because of the hotel design noise is amplified. The hotel its self was very nice. the pool seemed popular. and nice garden beds.
Breakfast was well cooked, they had some weird choices.
The afternoon tea in haven lounge was very nice. tasty canapes and tea or coffee.
There is a 7 Eleven right over the road and the Bingtang Supermarket 2 minutes walk away.
It definitely needs a bit of a spruce up. The cracked floor tiles every where are very off putting. But the location is good and the rest of the hotel is nice. id probably stay there again once they had done the rooms up.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1278,Not a 4 star Hotel,20,April 2016,"We booked this hotel after reading good reviews through Expedia, i have to say we were dissapointed. Yes the staff are friendly and you can fault that but the hotel is looking a little worn and needs work. I have to say on our last day they started to fix the wholes in the boards around the pool but that didnt happen at start of our stay.
During our stay we had to be moved due to the fact the air con didnt work well so we thought (but a staff memeber told me that the rooms are set at a temp and cant be changed) that didnt help us when trying to sleep as it was so stuffy and hot, we asked for an extra air con unit and it helped but wasnt great. The room smelt damp and u could see in the bathroom that all they had done was paint over the damp instead of treat it.

We felt the service charge of 21% was excessive as everywhere else we went it was a lot less.

THe cleaning of the rooms wasnt the highest standard.
A kid was sick in the pool and noboady cleaned it up not while we were at the pool
The food at breakfast was ok, and so was the pizzas but their dinner menu was awful, we had the lamb which was dry and over cooked, the food was bland and tasteless, we stopped eating there after that and went else where because it was so horriable.

On first impressions this is a good hotel but after that it was a massive let down.

We would reccomend for a night or 2 but deffo not 2 weeks, it isnt great. we will not return or reccomend it to our friends.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1279,Stayed in the awesome suite,40,April 2016,"As we arrived we were greeted by very friendly staff, and they sort out our room right away. Though we didn't realize that the suite unit had another lobby allocated closer to the room at the other end of the hotel. The staff was more than ready to lead us all the way to our room.

Me and my partner were both very pleased with the suite. Spacious was not enough to describe the room that we're in. With kitchen, dining table, living room, main room, two balconies (one with chair and the other with a bed) and a bathroom with bathtub in it. It seems like a very large place for just the two of us! Nonetheless it was an awesome room.

The breakfast served an array of food choices, enjoyed the french toast soo much that I ordered it everyday for breakfast. Though we wish that some of the food were a bit warmer when they are served.

Overall we enjoyed our stay here, though we hope that prices for suite can be reduced by a tiny amount as to ensure a longer stay with minimum dent to our wallet.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1280,Nothing to fault,50,April 2016,"Great service is often promised but rarely received The Haven came up with the goods every time, nice place, great location, awesome people will be returning the restaurants are nice and even though a little pricey compared to other places had great food and very convenient",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1281,Cleanliness & Appliances Issues,10,April 2016,"The Haven has an excellent location and outwardly appears picturesque. However, there are underlying issues with the hotel's cleanliness and room appliances.

Upon arrival, we found our room's floor covered with ants and an awful smell emanating from the bathroom. Despite house keeping's best attempts correct these issues, they were not successful. Additionally, the room refrigerator did not really keep the contents cool. This is not necessarily an issue for most travelers, however, it can be significant when traveling with an infant who requires milk.

The Haven was able to move us to a new room when one became available two nights after our arrival but the problems only continued. The air conditioner in our new room rarely functioned properly, raising the sleeping temperature of our room to a very humid 29 C. Haven engineering staff did attempt to correct the problem when we complained but their success was only temporary. The next night, the temperature was again a very uncomfortable 29 C. The front desk was kind enough to allow us to sleep in another room but it was a bit of hassle to change rooms at midnight.

We don't believe that we simply had a uniquely unlucky experience at the Haven. The engineering staff was constantly fixing aging air conditioning units and we heard other guests complain about leaky and otherwise dysfunctional refrigerators during check out.

Our advice would be to stay away from the The Haven until they update their room appliances and get a handle on their ant problem.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1282,Spacious and refreshing,40,March 2016,"Booked a suite, and my wife and I were extremely pleased with our accommodation and the excellent service. The a/c was as cold as we wanted (needed because it was hot and humid outside) and the rooms were very comfortable. Breakfasts were great and a wide variety of food offered - again service by staff was excellent. The pool area we used was relaxing and the water temperature was so refreshingly cool. My birthday happened to be on the day we checked out and I was pleased and very surprised that the hosts provided me with a small birthday cake as we prepared to depart. It was totally unexpected - an extra nice touch.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1283,Disappointed,30,April 2016,"Arrived at hotel at 12.15pm (lunch) was able to finally get my room at 4.15pm. Room and facilities were excellent. Staff were very much lacking. I found them not helpful, everything was too much bother for them. Hotel meal and drinks were based on Australian prices being very expensive for Bali. Meals were average. Have stayed in various areas and hotels in Bali, Seminyak and Kuta and by far this is not the worst but close to it. Was very disappointed with our treatment by reception staff and management. Would not recommend hotel to friends and family.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1284,Convenient and lovely hotel!!,50,April 2016,"We enjoyed staying at the Haven very much. The pools and buildings are beautiful and so are the suites, which are well equipped with lovely tea assortments and toiletries. The breakfast buffet at Lemon Cello restaurant is very complete and delicious and the hotel is well-located. Really loved this place, regretted not staying longer...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1285,Good Hotel but'...,30,April 2016,"Hotel in the busy and elite bali seminyak, spacious rooms and I've tried to stay here at the hotel or suite, service is quite good with the pool of unique and shady, and there is a private beach and the hotel staff will drive to the beach, just for the breakfast food halal (kosher) a bit difficult because of non-kosher served or in one place / cooking difficult that must eat and wear a kosher for my family and it is unfortunate keeping in we were guests want a good breakfast, and many hotels in bali especially 4 star and 5 star,which set up a and separate cooking tool to kosher and non-kosher, for the third time that we stay and no change at all, quite regrettable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1286,Great location close to everything,40,April 2016,"This is a very pleasant hotel close to just about everything - restaurants, bars, shops, hair & massage salons and a huge supermarket about 100 metres away which has a bottle shop inside. The hotel has 2 large pools and the rooms are large with balconies. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. There is a free shuttle service that drops you off at the beach, although we did walk back so it's not too far. The only complaint I have was with the themed beef and ribs buffet dinner (they have a different theme each night). The food was very average - not the same as photographed in the advertisement! Apart from that it's a good hotel and I would stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1287,Great Hotel,40,April 2016,"After my Labuan Bajo trip, I stop by at Bali before heading back to Jakarta. Stayed in this great hotel. Amazing room, staff are friendly, very clean hotel and superb location. Minutes walking distance to bar resto abd event beach!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1288,nice hotel friendly staff,40,March 2016,"this is my 4th stay at this hotel,and they really reward returning guest with cheaper deals,the buffet breakfast is great i always book the 1 bedroom suite the suite is large has a massive balcony and they supplied cooking utensials,the suites are looking tired need renovating but the biggest issue we had was the air con,depending on which maintance guy came to fix it sometimes they could fix it and cool the bedroom other times they could not we stayed 16 nights and seem to happen every 3 rd day that either the bedroom or the lounge air con would not work,they moved us to the ground floor room air con was great but again the bedroom air con not working properly after 2 days and water leaking on the floor from bedroom air con,also the ground floor you do not have the better views,i have stayed here 4 times normally room 115 i will be coming back again in 4 months i will stay here again because of the great staff and the excellant food and service and the great deals they give to regular quest but i just wish when they renovate the rooms that they replace the air con system with a new individual system like the other hotels i sometimes stay at in Seminyak",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1289,Don't be misguided,20,March 2016,"Booked on line and as usual photos are deceiving. Booked a room in the hotel section which was filthy. The airconditioner was leaking onto the floor and the bathroom was covered in mould. These rooms are a disaster to your health. Only just got into the room and blankly refused to stay a minute in there. Saw Manager who then upgraded us into a suite room, which was only just better. They have a serious problem with cleanliness. The bathrooms are covered in mould, not that a bit of exit mould or bleach couldn't fix. I had to get the cleaning staff to spray the shower recess with bleach before I could have a shower and this is in one of the suite rooms. Mould has got under all the silicone around the shower and needs to be redone. All in all this hotel needs a complete renovation and clean. There are much better four star hotels around and I cannot for the life of me understand how they can uphold a four star rating with these conditions.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1290,A great pit stop,50,March 2016,"We stayed at the haven for one night en route to the gilis, so only a short experience but a very good one - we got upgraded to a gorgeous suite with two terrace balconies in the back half of the hotel that we would have been happy to stay a week in!
The hotel is much bigger than I first thought (a mix of hotel buildings and villas) but with 2 pool, bar, restaurant areas at either end, nothing is too far away. The staff were pleasant and helpful & breakfast was pretty good too. It's down the bottom end of Seminyak (near Bintang supermarket) and apparently they have a shuttle to their own beach club (didn't try that) but most importantly, it was great value for money! I'd definitely stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1291,Regular,30,April 2016,"Not the worst breakfast i have ever had in a hotel, but close. The rooms need renovating, but are clean. Overall it was okay to stay there. The ""Beach Club"" closes at 5 pm, the best time on the beach.......",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1292,Best Alternative to booking a Villa in Seminyak,50,March 2016,"We stayed for 5 nights @ The Haven in kate March.
The One Bedroom Suite was massive, modern and comfortable for our family(2 Adults, 2yo & 10mth old) & excellent value for money.
Buffett breakfast had everything you needed and more & the chefs always delivered eggcelent eggs to your liking and fluffy pancakes.
Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful and always had time to chat with our kids.
The reservations staff(Inda) went above and beyond to help my extended family members get decent rooms as well.
Family friendly resort close to everything and just down the road from BINTANG SUPERMARKET.
Overall a very pleasant experience😉

WHAT THEY CAN IMPROVE ON???
*Food at the hotel was a bit expensive and when you add 20% tax on top of the advertised prices, it is even more costly.
*I think the suites have way too many cupboards in the kitchen, i counted 12 big cupboards with only 2 tall glasses and 2 wine glasses and some cutlery in it. It needs at least 6 of each type of glass.
In saying that, they did deliver us a kitchen set when we called housekeeping which included a small pot, pan, some cooling utensils and a big knife.
*They only offer 2 very small bottles of water which is not enough for a family of 4 considering, you need enough water to drink and brush your teeth with as Bali water is undrinkable.
*the bath is very hard to get in and out of, needs a step especially for the elderly or younger children.
*Sliding door to balcony is extremely large and very very difficult to slide open.

These are minor negatives in comparison with the overall extremely pleasant experience we enjoyed.

I would recommend any small family to stay at Haven:-)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1293,Disappointed- Do not recommend,30,April 2016,"I stayed in a Standard room for one night. I was highly annoyed by the claustrophobic size of the room especially the bathroom. The bathroom floor was filthy. The shower sprayed everywhere outside of the shower making the bathroom a soaking dirty mess. The bathroom is also all glass so your partner can watch you shower or have diarrhea whichever. Zero privacy. The balcony FELT LIKE A PRISON. It faced a WALL and was over the pool. The noise was crazy from the pool on one side and the staff moving about from the hallway. We also later realized we way over paid for the car ride we ordered and paid the hotel to the airport. Do not book this hotel. Too expensive for this experience.

Breakfast is included and is good, No complaints there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1294,Standard rooms are dirty better pay for a suite,30,March 2016,"I checked into this hotel after staying with a group of friends in a villa so it was always going to suffer in comparison. Check in was very slow I arrived at 1.30pm and a room did not become available till 4.00pm. For a fairly new hotel the room was in pretty bad condition. It stunk of smoke and was generally dirty and run down. The internet barely worked and the air-conditioning fluctuated. I had requested a high floor and it was still pretty noisy. See my photos and judge for yourself.
I managed one night and then dragged a duty manage up so that he could see the condition of the room for himself. He said he would get back to me in 20 minutes. An hour and a half later I was contacted and they shifted me to a suite. It was much cleaner. For some reason the wifi worked and there was efficient air-conditioning.It was also much quieter.
The suites are definitely the way to go.As for the standard rooms if you are on a budget then there are better cleaner rooms in Bali for a quarter of the price. The hotel is conveniently located and the pool and public areas are well maintained.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1295,Quiet hotel hidden in the buzzing Seminyak with the best spa ever,40,April 2015,"This place is on one of the main streets in seminyak abuzz with shoppers and passers-by. However, the moment you enter the hotel, it feels like you have left the world behind. Amazingly tranquil ambivalence, a fresh fragrance all over, the most polite staff and a huge room is what you get in the Haven. I loved the buffet breakfast and the spa is the best I have ever gotten.

Small downside would be that the room furniture is not exactly new, the pool is rather small and the hotel is not on the beach. They do have scheduled shuttle service to the beach though.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1296,Was a pleasant stay overall :),40,March 2016,"On the whole my stay at the Haven with two friends was a very pleasant one.

Rooms were nice, and was great being on the ground floor and access directly to the pool. If you are a light sleeper you might want a room at a higher level as the noise does carry and people constantly walking past during the evening and quite audible from ground floor rooms.

Really good gym and there are some private villas behind that are worth checking out.

My only complaint were the staff at the pool bar who were challenging. It was difficult just to get champagne glasses and ice and required several calls to reception and then having to go to reception and almost offer to get it yourself.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1297,Loved It!,40,January 2016,"Spent 7 nights with 2 teenagers in a 2 bedroom suite. We try to stay somewhere different each time we go to Bali and this would have to be one of the best set ups for families I have found. 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen with full size fridge and lounge area. Two lovely pools with comfortable pool beds. Pools are however in the shade most of the day. Decking around the pool needs some attention. Staff sets this resort apart from a lot of others, they were absolutely lovely and friendly and always acknowledged you when you walked past. Massage at the spa was good. Seriously a real haven as it is very quiet at the back area where the suites are but you walk out the front into the madness of Seminyak/Legian - perfect! Good selection of different food to choose from at breakfast.. Bintang Supermarket just up the road was worth a visit. Of course there were some small negatives like having to ask for the air con to be fixed and not being able to contact room service one night but all in all we really all enjoyed staying here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1298,Good for family stay,30,March 2016,"Family room, i mean connecting room was awesome. Its had a large living room between two rooms n dvd player.
Big refrigerator n dining table.
But the big problem is too many Mosquitos !
Swimming pool n restaurant also good.
A little bit far, cos our room available on the last of the hotel building.
Maze corridor .... hahaha",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1299,Loud but good,30,March 2016,"I liked the rooms, the breakfast, the staff and the location!

I did not like the noise. It was the first time I stayed on the lower levels (same level as reception) and the noise from the pool starts at 7am and does not end until late. For some reason I never remember there being a lot of families as the rooms usually attract couples.

It was like being in a hostel rather than 4* hotel in regards to the level of sound. I would recommend picking a room on a higher level to dull the sound a little.
This is the 4th time I have stayed at the Haven and it will be my last, mainly due to the sound issues and also as I should attempt some variety when travelling.

I cannot be certain, but my wallet went missing from my room. I don't use my actual wallet when I travel in Bali, so the wallet was empty with just my drivers license and credit card in it on the table below the TV. When I went to checkout it was no longer in the room. As I said, I don't like to point fingers or blame, but if it was indeed taken by hotel staff I would be sad. I could have locked it in the safe, but I despise having to cram all my belongings into a safe as I should be able to sleep knowing I am not going to be robbed by staff, after all, it isn't the Bounty.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1300,Soooo relaxed,40,March 2016,"We stayed for 7 nights in March in a 1 bedroom suite, which was great. Only an additional $40 a night and the room is double or more of the size of a standard room.
Like all Bali hotels it's a little worn I places, but only slightly and still very luxurious.
The staff are lovely, the breakfast is very good. The back pool isn't overly crowded and it's pretty easy to find a lounge to laze on all day.
If you like to frequent the busy end of Seminyak and all of the hit restaurants then I'd suggest staying closer to them, as the taxi ride can sometimes take 45 or more minutes due to bad traffic. Really, the Haven is located in Legian.
Would recommend the Haven to anyone as an affordable luxury escape.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1301,Nice showers and that's about it...,20,March 2016,"I've recently stayed at The Haven for a night and got upgraded to a suite. My friend didn't get upgraded and was able to compare the rooms. Compared to the standard rooms, it was slightly nicer, not sure whether you want to pay for the difference, only noticeable difference is the bathroom being nicer. The suites are located at the back of the resort andnitmwas a fair trek to get there. Service was poor as they didn't show us to the room and we were left guessing where to go with no staff willing to help.

In the morning, due to our pick up being before breakfast, we were given a breakfast box. Good gesture but it just looks like death. The only thing I took from it was the water and left everything behind. I'd rather eat air then what was in the box.

Would I be back? Probably not, there seems to be other hotels in seminyak that offers better quality for the same price.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1302,Ideal Hotel for Seminyak Bali,50,March 2016,"On arrival at The Haven Bali, you are greeted by a friendly reception team - after nearly 20 hours travelling from the United Kingdom - It was great to be offered cold towels straight away. The staff were very helpful and check in was quick and easy. A bellboy showed us to our room. The bedroom was spacious, clean, and we had a nice view of the pool area.
(Room 518 - If I remember correctly).
The gardens and pool area were great, every time we went to the pool we managed to get a bed, there was plenty of shade which is needed when it was 35 degrees.
I would recommend using the club lounge, this is located at the back of the hotel on floor 1. The hotel offers a high tea every day starting around 4 until 6 (Might need to check the times). They offer cold drinks, and snacks for free. I think you pay if you drank alcoholic drinks (beer/wine). We stayed at the Haven for a week, and we used it most days...!! Location of the hotel is perfect very close to some EXCELLENT restaurants, shops and free shuttles to the beach (*Nice area on the beach to relax)
We stayed at the Haven Bali during the Balinese New Year, (Nyepi ""Day of Silence"") So we were restricted to stay in the resort all day. We had the buffet breakfast which was nice, lots of choice. If you happen to stay this time of year - Make sure you visit the supermarket the day before..!! Everything shuts down, and your not allowed on the streets. (We had a chilled day by the pool, which isn't a bad thing!)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1303,3rd time unlucky,30,March 2016,"As per the title, this is my third time at The Haven. We stayed in a two bedroom suite which although spacious and on the surface rather nice, it's a damn shame that at only six years old, this hotel appears fifteen years old due to the cracks and mould. It really is a shame as the rooms are done in lovely modern wood and stone features and are quite spacious.
If we had been staying more than a few nights I would have asked to be moved as we were situated directly above the restaurant and noise starts at 6.30am, wouldn't have been too bad however a screaming child was there from 7am-9am every morning.
I like the convenience of the hotel, around seven mins walk to double six beach, cocoon etc and for the price this is a nice hotel. I found it to be A LOT busier than the previous two times and we couldn't find sun loungers for our entire stay. The welcome drinks really do need to be alcoholic though... Orange juice? I wouldn't bother!
The pools can be relaxing, when not so busy however one thing that really really made me angry was people in the pool smoking, not cool, this definitely should have been addressed by the staff.
The 'afternoon tea' was put to the test when we fancied a coffee to wake us up before setting out for the evening... Rather nice tbh, amuse bouche, satay sticks, spring rolls, sandwiches, truffles... yum!
We also had a massage at the spa, very relaxing.
The door swipe cards are a pain in the bum as they persistently stop working, staff say it's due to them being close to a credit card or mobile.... Erm.. Course they are!
The reason I say 'third time unlucky' is the reason we will not return. Now I know this is Bali and accidents happen but with the apparent water damage and mould under every air con unit that I saw, it's fair to say that this is an on going problem and management are well aware that the air con units not only leak but leak enough water to pull on your wellies and have a good old splash around in. One of our party ended up A over T and with a nasty bruise. A note to say that they were experiencing 'issues' and to be aware of the problem would've been a big help.
I think that value for money The Haven is spot on. We enjoyed our holiday, this isn't a 5* resort but nice little place to rest your head. Comfy, clean beds and good breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1304,Nice but wouldn't stay here again,30,October 2015,"The photos online are definitely nicer than in reality. The restaurant service was poor and overpriced. The rooms weren't very clean and kinda old. My friends had mosquitos in their room and I had dead cockroaches on the floor, not very nice. Overall it was good but if I come back to Bali I wouldn't stay here again. The spa is very nice, I loved the 3 hour indulgence package.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1305,good value for money,40,March 2016,"Hotel is MASSIVE! we arrived at the front entrance and had to walk miles to the back where our room was (which turns out had it's own little entrance). Rooms are massive and spacious. Very comfy bed. Bathroom shower was massive but would have been nice to have a bath. Pool was really lovely, very good cool temperature for hot days and lots of day beds which was good. Staff just seem a bit unhappy there! Not sure why but compared to everywhere else in Bali/Gili Islands they just weren't as friendly/welcoming. Might have just been the big resort vibe? Anyway was very good location and easy walking distance to lots of nice restaurants, shops and to the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1306,The Haven Bali,40,March 2016,Location wise the Haven is centrally located in the heart of Seminyak restaurants and shopping and the beach is literally a 10min walk. It was my first time Bali and I enjoyed my stay at the Haven. The hotel is laid out so that most of the rooms balconies face inward over the pool so if you want privacy you should request a room off the ground floor. My room was at the back section of the hotel looking over the second pool... clean quiet.. bit of noise from people splashing in pool. The pool loses the sun in the early afternoon as it is nestled between the two hotel buildings. I recommend including breakfast .. great selection of food both western and Indonesian to choose. I found the staff polite and helpful - great stay.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1307,Great stay,40,March 2016,"We were lucky to be able to stay in a 1 bedroom villa with pool, no complaints with the villa plenty of room, bed was comfortable the bathroom very large. The breakfast was really good, will admit sometime the egg corner was a bit inconsistent in the cooking of the eggs. Found the staff most of the time
friendly always wishing good morning/afternoon. Would stay again would even look at the suites which look very nice. The check in was not as good as in the past but could be down to new staff member",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1308,Horrible!,10,March 2016,"Dirty room and constant bad sewerage smell, absolutely disgusting. Mouldy and stains everywhere. The taps look like they have ever been wiped! Very noisy.
Sheets smell weird and old. Can't wait to get out of here! Overall unpleasant stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1309,Iittle disappointed,30,March 2016,"We stayed here 6 years ago when it was new and absolutely loved it. We have stayed in south Kuta since and thought we would stay back here for a change. We were a little disappointed as the service, breakfast and rooms were very average.
The rooms are a little run down as we had water leaking through our roof the whole stay, even after maintenance said it was fixed, then the air con started leaking water on the floor.
The food was very average and my husbands chicken parmigiana was cold.
Breakfast was ok but, order eggs and they come when you are about to leave.
The bath in the ensuite is very dangerous as it is very deep bed slippery and not really anything to hold onto when getting out, which resulted in my husband slipping and hurting his ribs.- no he wasn't drunk.
The staff weren't as friendly as they have been in the past and seems to be too hard to help.
I can say the guards at the front were more than happy to help cross the road and with directions.
Would think twice before staying here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1310,Poor service,10,March 2016,"When we arrived we thought we had booked our room through expedia with breakfast. The difference to book with breakfast was $6. We ask if they could honor the price to save us Wasting time calling expedia. They refused. $6. Called expedia. They tried hard. 2 hours. Back and forth with the hotel to try and sort it out. The expedia rep said he could likely cancel this booking and rebook the one with breakfast. The Haven refused to let us do that. $6. We spoke with the manager. Sugita . He basically laughed at us and said you get what you book. And implied that we weren't going to get any more deals because the expedia deal is good enough already. Gaining angry customers for $6.

At the end of it all we tried to even cancel amd go to another hotel on principle. They refused.

They put us in a room beside the front desk. The walls are thin. And can hear loud walky talkies and phones ringing all night. When we called to plead that we can't sleep. No apologies. The front desk clerk said ""it's loud because you are right beside the front desk.""

The shower was falling apart. The front of line staff are horrible and the manager was worse. If I could give -10 I would. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1311,Wonderful stay with family,40,March 2016,"I stayed with my husband and my 2-year old daughter for 5 days in a suite room which is very clean, spacious, and beautiful. It has living room, kitchen set, and daybed outside, perfect for a family. The staffs are all amazing, the front staffs, housekeeping staffs, bellboys, laundry staff, the staffs in the breakfast area, they are so helpful and friendly. And Deni the engineer staff helped me in fixing my daughter's stroller fan when my daughter started getting cranky because of the unbearable heat, thank you so much! Breakfast is good, kolak singkong (cassava with brown sugar) at the bread corner is delicious! The hotel location is fantastic, the drugstore and mini market just across the road, walking distance to double six beach, my favorite Grain Espresso is just 200m from the hotel, and surrounded by many many beautiful boutiques and restaurants. It was so hard for us to leave on our last day coz we just wanted to stay longer. Excellent service and perfect location made this hotel feel like home. Two thumbs up!!!!!! Strongly recommended!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1312,Great place to stay. The suites are great :),50,March 2016,I knew where the hotel was located sine I passed by many times before. . The Suites are really big and clean. The staff in general are very friendly. The breakfast served next to the pool for the suites customers is really delicious. It was one of the best I ever had in Bali (and I'm always staying in 4 or 5 * hotels at least twice a year. For sure I'll come back to this hotel soon !,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1313,Amazing,50,October 2015,"Myself and 7 friends visited The Haven twice on our 2 week holiday to Bali. We booked the hotel on the arrival into Bali before setting off on our travels around the beautiful country. I cannot fault the hotel one bit, super clean and the hotel staff were very helpful! Our flight arrived into Bali in the early hours, on arrival to The Haven the staff checked us in, it was a pain free check in which is what we needed due to our exhaustion after a 17 hour flight. Our luggage was taken up to our rooms, as there were 7 of us they ensured all of our rooms were next to each other. Breakfast was lovely buffet style, fresh juice, pancakes etc. We returned to The Haven on our last night in Bali due to it being close to the airport and how much we loved it before.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1314,Great hotel for great price,50,March 2016,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Seminyak for a great price on Travelocity! We were spoiled...Very clean hotel, kind staff, great air con and breakfast, amazing pool and walking distance to many places. Very impressed with this place, hope to return!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1315,Epic hotel,50,March 2016,"Massive hotel with a beautiful pool. A lovely escape from the hectic streets. You can walk through the pool oasis to a second smaller pool too.
For the cheap overall price - very good value.
Our room was large and had a lovely balcony. It was however quite damp and the shower leaked onto the floor.
The restaurant and bar is very expensive but because the hotel is so centrally located this was not an issue - we walked and ate out all the time.
Staff were great - helped us organise a driver when needed. And there 24/7. Also felt very safe.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1316,Central place to stay,40,March 2016,"The Haven in Seminyak is a good Hotel to stay in Seminyak, that is on the main St in Seminyak and close to everything that you need. It is walking distance to the Bingtang supermarket and is walking distance to the beach. The Haven also have a service that will drop you down to the beach which is great.
It is about a. 10 minute if that trip by taxi to Seminyak square where you can get great meal in fantastic restaurants.
All in all The Haven is clean and well run, with people that are only too happy to help if you need it.
I will go back there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1317,The Haven Seminyak,40,March 2016,"Stayed in Suite, which was to back of the hotel and very quiet away from the noisier front of hotel. Rooms were large and spacious, with very large balcony overlooking pool. Staff were generally very attentive and helpful. Breakfast buffet was very good. Although only a 10 minute walk to the hotels private beach area, a free shuttle buggy was provided every two hours to transport you there. Overall, this hotel offers good value for money and I would be happy to stay here again if returning to Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1318,Fantastic staff,40,March 2016,We stayed here for a week and had a nice room overlooking the pool on the top floor. Staff were so friendly and attentive...and this goes for each and every one we came across. Breakfast was lovely with quite a lot of choice; a mixture of western and Asian food. Our room was spacious and had everything we needed. Furnishings etc maybe a little out dated like a lot of the other reviews say. But overall a great place to stay. Good location and close to the beach - there is also a free hotel shuttle that will take you there. The hotel has two pools - this took us a few days to figure out. The other one is definitely worth checking out! Would recommend this hotel if you want a nice place to stay for a decent price.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1319,Short trip in Bali,40,April 2015,"The hotel is quite nice. The rooms are clean, the breakfast is not bad.
The location is quite nice. Located at Seminyak road. Lots of shops and restaurants. For those who are not frequent traveller to Bali, you might want to consider staying in this hotel. As for me, I will stay in different hotel far away from Seminyak. The traffic is very bad. I prefer staying in Nusa Dua with the family, less traffic means less stress.
But for those who love crowded places, you might want to try this hotel. For the location wise, the hotel is good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1320,Mrs. maria,30,March 2016,A bit disappointed with rooms they are a bit old the lighting is very poor. and depressing the hotel could do with a bit of a facelift The lifts have a very bad smell staff very friendly and helpful I don't think I would recommend,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1321,Great place to stay in Legian,50,February 2016,"Great location, we had our room upgraded to a suite room, spacious and great. Breakfast selection was great. Staff are always polite and willing to help make our stay enjoyable. Highly recommended to all.
Would have been better if not hassled by taxi drivers offering their services at the point of entrance",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1322,"Great hotel,perfect location",40,September 2015,"Very nice hotel.spacious and clean but not suitable for family with kids because u can peep thru toilet.perfect location as the hotel is in the middle of shops,restaurants,bars and only a few minutes walk to the beach.
Downstairs lounge is good to hang out with friends but have a very limited seating.they have live band performing every weekends.
Warung Madè is a few minutes walk from the hotel.good food.thise who love spicy food can try warung madè nasi goreng.very good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1323,Lovely hotel,40,February 2016,"Great location, right in the heart of everything, bars cafe, shops.
Room a bit dated but served its purpose.
Pool great, peacefull, relaxing.
Breackfast and evening buffett was exellent great food.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Seminyak.
Staff was very helpful with everything a,ways had a smile.
I emailed the hotel a week before to get an upgrade on our room to a suit, never heard back till a week in to our holiday. I did not want to ask on check in they was very busy, our room was ok.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1324,Fantastic,40,January 2016,"I booked for haven room.. when I want to check in they told me if our room upgrade to suite room.. the room very big and perfect have everything you need.
Breakfast excellent with staff friendly..
But a bit disappointed for the parking area for go to suite room.. too dark..
Recommend for this hotel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1325,Disappointing,30,December 2015,Stayed here over Xmas. We had stayed here 3 years before and loved it so thought why not go back. The hotel unfortunately has really gone downhill since then. We booked a suite which had marks/ damage everywhere. More maintenance is needed to the rooms. Would not stay again plenty of nicer hotels in better locations to chose from.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1326,"Very nice hotel, excellent choice at breakfast!",50,February 2016,"This hotel is one of the more expensive ones but you do get what you pay for. The location is good, just a 10/15 minute stroll to the beach and plenty of shops and restaurants around. Rooms are he with modern fittings and lovely ad clean. Did get a bit of noise from the band (which sounded terrible!) some nights. The breakfast is lovely with a huge selection, freshly cooked eggs and pancakes, pastries, fruit, delicious! Also ate in the restaurant one night which was really lovely. The pool is nice an cool, doesn't get too much sunlight but this would not bother most people. Would stay again if I wasn't watching how much I was spending.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1327,Hit the mark,40,March 2016,"Place has its flaws like any with a few outdated things in the rooms but you get that. Overall content with the hotel and its location in Seminyak to all the good shopping and restaurants.

Hiccup on check in with them trying to tell us we had to have two single beds for the first night. However we didn't accept this and after 25mins of pushing we got the room we booked for the duration of our stay.

Pool nice and quiet to relax and swim. Breakfast was simply but effective with everything you needed. Midway between Kuta and Potato Head and other good restaurants only $5 cab ride away makes for an ideal stay when your not in your room the whole day.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1328,err not quite a Haven....,30,January 2016,A very average experience overall. The location is right smack into everything so thats a plus point for the hotel. rooms are not very big and a little sad in the decor but served its function as a place to sleep . the buffet breakfast was ordinary.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1329,Bad and good,10,February 2016,"We booked a 2 bed pool villa over six months ago for 2 couples, when we checked in, in late Feb, we went through the whole check in process. Once that was done, we were told that a service manager needed to talk to us. That was not usual and caused concern.

We are told that the villa would not be availabLe until the next day at 3.00pm - the usual check in time, because there was a problem with the room. Plumbing had broken, but we were assured that at 3.00 pm the day we could get in. We were offered another room with joining room and were told it was a 2 bedroom suite. Ehh.

We declined that offer and requested another option, they offered one night at another villa, which we were told was part of the haven, clearly not, and it was near bypass road. We had a look and asked if it was available for the 4 nights as we did not want or short time to be disjointed. We were advised that the villa was only available for 1 night, but we would then be able to repack and check out at 11.00am and not be in our haven villa until 3.00.

One of our group then asked the front office staff in the new villa if they had rooms available for 4 days, as he started to check his system, our minder from the haven quickly spoke to him and with a grin said sorry fully booked. Now that sent us all over the edge.

We asked how could the haven guarantee that the villa room would be ready by 3.00 as they could not say for sure that the plumbing problem would be fixed, our minder said just trust her. We said that she could noir guarantee it would be fixed, she became a little agitated and said it would be. We asked why then did we have to wait until 3.00 to get in the room if by chance it would have been fixed earlier. That's when I asked her outright did you overbook our room and make up this story. Then she got really agitated and that is when we asked to speak to the resort manager.

We were told that she had complete authority, we asked for a cancellation with full refund and said not possible.again asked for the main manager, she told us that he was in a meeting. Hmmm. Within 2 minutes he came walking out too meet us.

The up shot is that the main manager understood what we were saying and agreed to a full refund. It took us 3 hours to get to this point.

If the first manager had simply told us that the room was overbooked, rather than some made up reason then it may have altered our decision. But because it was clear that she had backed herself in a corner, there was no way out.

Although we got our money back, within 24 hours, and that the main manager acted without delay, none of the other party members wanted to consider staying there because of what transpired.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1330,Great place to relax and hide from all the hussle and bustle outside!,50,March 2015,"This hotel is like an Oasis and a great place to relax and hide from all the hussle and bustle outside! Great ambiance, nice pools, good breakfast and buffet dinners, great service! I will stay here again, if I ever be back to Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1331,Nice stay at the Haven,40,February 2016,"The hotel is in a great location, short walk or taxi to the heart of Seminyak or Legian.

Room.
The room on first arrival shower did not work properly but one quick email to management as placed in a better room with a proper shower etc.
rooms are perfect have everything you need.
House keeping was most of the time good wouldn't say great needed some reminders but did the job in the end.

Breakfast.
I would say the buffet is great but over priced when a add on to the room. i would recommend not having buffet and going for a little work to some of the many places that serve breakfast.

Hotel/surroundings.

The hotel it's self is beautiful, the pools both front pool (busy) to the back pool are perfect just add a pool bar and it would tick all the boxes.
Hotel staff are as many others have said amazing always happy to help, my only negative is the taxi/travel desk in the hotel constantly getting pestered for transport.

Beach club.
The hotel offers a free cart to the beach club (sun beds in roped off area) all though it's not much of a ""beach club"" it's a perfect spot to relax with a cool towel on arrival, sun beds and towels.

Afternoon tea.
The afternoon tea is well worth checking out on your stay, set on the 1st floor at the back of the hotel they offer drinks and food free of charge perfect if your peckish after a long day by the pool.

Overall.

Iv been to Bali now 7 times and would recommend the haven hotel to anyone who wanted to stay just out of Legian with a resort style hotel that has so much to offer.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1332,Great oasis in the bustling Seminyak,50,November 2015,"We only stayed one night with our 3 year old daughter but it was perfect. Great baby pool by the breakfast are so kids can play and we could eat. Great service, perfect location being right on the doorstep of the main road but set back far enough and a big enough complex to be super quiet - you wouldn't even know. So close to everything.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1333,Fantastic,50,February 2016,"Would highly recommend staying here. We had a villa which was amazing. If not staying in a villa I would recommend the suite rooms as they are down the back and quieter

The restaurant is great and there is a choice of 2 pools the first one being a bit rowdier

Also they have a beach club area at the beach with private day beds right next to a bar for ice cold drinks.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1334,Beautiful setting,40,February 2016,"Our family of 4 stayed in the 2 bedroom suite. It was very comfortable and nicely decorated.
The grounds are beautiful also.
So I was conflicted on how to rate this hotel because we were very comfortable but it did fall short in a few areas. They add a very strong fragrance through the air conditioner which made us get headaches. There didn't seem to be any designated smoking areas in the breakfast area or the pool so often I had to move my kids away to avoid the smoke ( I realise this also comes down to the manners of the smokers too). The large kitchen in our suite only had cutlery and crockery for 2 people. Other than that there was nothing else, not even a sponge. So it was really just for show. You shouldn't have to ask for kitchen basics when you book a suite with a kitchen.
This hotel is better for groups without children.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1335,Good location but very noisey,40,February 2016,"The hotel part is quiet nice but nothing special with average western style rooms. It is in a central location to beach shops and restaurants with easy walking and heaps of motor scooters for hire. The staff are exceptionally pleasant and courteous. The only let down is the noise that echoes up from the central pool area, especially unpleasant with drunk crass guests in the area and the karaoke style musicians with their amps to loud in the restaurant. I was on the top floor and right at the back and was still getting a lot of unwanted noise.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1336,Underestimated,40,February 2016,"I'm not going to lie, when I was booking The Haven, despite all of the great reviews my friends have given about the place, I was very skeptical. I am someone who is very critical when analysing hotel rooms, and like us all, like value for money. As I travelled in a group of 5, we had to keep everyone happy, hence allowing the booking of The Haven. After frantically looking at reviews on TripAdvisor and looking at hundreds of photos of the place, I can gladly say that photos absolutely do NOT do this hotel justice. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and seem to be never-ending! We stayed in a two bedroom suite, in the back building (which is pretty far from the entrance when you are a bunch of girls who do not pack light!). The area was extremely spacious, clean and very homely. I am someone who doesn't like the look of your typical hotel room look, and I like to stay at places that are a little bit different, but I was impressed. Each bedroom had an ensuite, one containing a shower and the other with a bath/shower in one. The living room connected to both bedrooms. We also had 3 balconies, with amazing views of the pool. I do have three negatives about the rooms, but they are very minor, nit picking things. My first would be the lighting in the room, especially the bedroom. It is very orange and not very luminous, although it feels like the light is penetrating through your head if you're underneath it. The lighting in the bathroom is not particularly good to do your makeup in either, nor is any of the lighting really. My next negative is that both bathrooms from time to time start to smell like sewerage. I noticed it was when you turn the taps on sometimes. Lastly, the showers take a very long time to heat up and for you to find the right temperature, and then they end up burning you.

The hotel staff are very friendly and every staff member greets you when you walk past. They are very attentive, and although not all of them speak excellent English, you can tell they are trying very hard. I would also recommend trying out the facilities the hotel offers. I would not recommend the gym - it is a very small room, and the treadmill seems to have a mind of it's own, changing the pace rapidly from 6 to 14 within an unreasonable amount of time. I would recommend going to the spa for a massage which is $25 AUD for a 60 minute, full body massage. The hotel also offers various classes like pilates by the pool, which we did not get to try out.

The breakfast buffet is offered at two locations that I know of (since the premises seem to be never-ending I need this to be confirmed, but we did try out two places). Every morning the dishes offered were changed (this was unfortunate for me as I thoroughly enjoyed the mushrooms from the first time, and never saw them again). It's definitely not the best buffet breakfast I've seen, but you can't ask for too much more, it's everything you need really. The hygiene of the place isn't the best, every morning if you go to the Lobby to have breakfast, amongst the desserts and pastries, I guarantee that you'll find multiple bees/wasps attached to a pastry. The service at the restaurant is great though.

The location of this hotel, for me, was not the best as it's closer to Legian and Kuta. For the things that I was interested in seeing and wanted to do, it would have better suited me to stay closer towards Seminyak square, which is about a 5/10 minute drive from The Haven and a 30 minute walk. I do recommend walking at least once from The Haven, to Seminyak Square, as there are so many beautiful boutiques to visit - which I, regretfully did not do. There are many excellent restaurants to try down this strip as well.

Overall, The Haven has been wonderful to stay at, and I would gladly come back again. The Haven has made my first experience to Bali, one to remember. Thank you for your hospitality and great service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1337,"Nice location, nice staff",40,February 2016,"We actually booked this hotel as a transit hotel, because we arrived at night in Bali. When we did a check in, they upgraded our room. Nice, big and so comfortable room to stay. The location is also great because it is not far from the beach, yet at the same time nearby lots of restaurants and shops",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1338,The Roller Coaster Ride at The Haven,20,February 2016,"Since the first time we came to this hotel, it's been a roller coaster ride. We made an online booking for 2 rooms and it turns out they already gave our rooms to other guests. We were upset. However, they gave us free upgrade to the 2 bedrooms villa. At first they told us that the upgrade was for 2 nights. But apparently the villa has been booked by another guest so they only gave us for 1 night. They gave us the allowance of late check-out until 6pm the next day. It was a very beautiful villa... But it was raining and the electricity in our room went off twice and the floor was flooding. On the next day, we asked for the extension of the check out time until 8pm. But apparently they said that they will charge us for 1 night if we want to extend for 2 more hours when at first they told us that it was for 2 nights. How disappointing we were. After multiple phone calls with Haven (we were at Nusa Dua), they finally agreed to extend it for free without the charge. So we finally being moved from the villa to the small hotel room. On the 3rd day, our parents check in to an additional room with the same price of the other 2 rooms but surprisingly they got a suite. On that night when we returned to the hotel, one of the rooms had a broken aircon. It was very hot and humid, and the one who stayed there was sick. We complained and asked them to move to another room. We waited for 1 hour while the technician checked the aircon and they said we need to wait for another hour until the aircon is fixed. They also said that they are already over-booked because they are already at 100% capacity but they had another guest checking in without the available room exactly like what we experienced the first night. How come they accept more bookings than their capacity? Anyway, at the end they agreed to move us to another room which apparently a Grand Suite room!! So it was worth the wait and trouble, i guess... Meanwhile at my parents' suite room, they found a baby cockroach at the bathroom near the toothbrush... That's so gross... So that's all i guess. thank you for reading our story.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1339,Good location,30,January 2016,"Check in was not smooth. We arrived after 3pm and our room is still not ready. I liked to check an hour or two to avoid crowd at the receptionist. We were escorted to the lounge of suite building and waited for almost an hour and hv to find staff on updates of our room while our driver is waiting for us. We stayed at 1 bedroom suite and 1 bedroom pool villa as we want to experience the different type of rooms. The suite is spacious, comfortable, bright, with seating area, there r 2 tv one in seating area n in the bedroom, coffee and dining table and fully equip kitchen its more than u can ask for the rate that you are paying. Great for families n group too. Come with long balcony n smoking corner. The day bed is a plus point if u want to laze outdoor without leaving your room. The room is not very clean, there are alot of stains on the counter top, dining table n floor. During our few days stay I did not see anyone cleaning the floor. Good location in Seminyak. There are two entrance one fr Seminyak main road, good if u are staying in the hotel and the other one is at the back and convenient if u r staying at the Suite n Villa. There are complimentary afternoon tea.

The villa have a luxurious bathroom and very spacious. Indoor and outdoor shower. Private pool but still can be seen by hotel patrons and next building fr higher floor. There is no coffee table (there r side table) or dining table in the villa which is inconvenient if u want eat and if the weather is hot or raining outside. The only available table is outside, a small table with two chair by the pool. There is a study table with a chair. There is only one TV facing the bed. The only way to watch it is either u sit or lying down on the bed. It would be better if the TV would be able to turn to the seating area, so that we have a choice as how we like to watch the tv.
The rate for the villa is higher but the suite is better suited for me. I've stayed in alot of villas in Bali but this is the 1st time of my stay in a villa where breakfast would not be served in the room. They could serve to the room with an extra cost that is additional two breakfast set which i find it absurd when my stay is inclusive of breakfast. Should had only charge for service of sending the breakfast to the room. We were offered one complimentary breakfast served in the room. You have to walk to the breakfast area which is located at the suite building.
Service was great fr the staff.
One other thing is staff will wear their shoes / footwear whenever they come in the room both in suite and villa. Yes there are slippers provided in the room but it get wet and dirty too. The villa is cleaner than the suite. Management should look on the cleanliness issue.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1340,"excellent services, nice villa",40,March 2015,"We visited in March 2015 as a gift from one of our credit cards and we booked an additional night at a reasonable price. The villa was huge and nicely decorated. Staff was nice too. We tried their Spa too and it was very comfortable.

Very good value for money :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1341,Great location with affordable price,40,February 2016,"One of the great option to stay at seminyak. If you want to strolling around seminyak, you should stay here... you can explore seminyak from here, all the boutiques and cafes.. great place! and oh, love the pool!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1342,Average hotel,30,February 2016,"We found this hotel a huge let down. Upon arrival we were shown to our room... a very standard room with a balcony facing a cement wall that we could reach from the balcony. The rooms are very standard and basic...nothing great. We got a deal and paid half price for this hotel, both my partner and i agree that if we had paid full price we would've been furious and devastated.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1343,Excellent Service,40,March 2015,"Stayed here more than a few times for business. There are probably plenty of better hotels in Bali but this hotel was perfect for business.
The check in was fast, they upgraded us whenever they could, and the service was very friendly.
The room service was not 24 hours so if you arrived late at night after a long flight, it was annoying not to be able to order room service but you should've known that when booking the hotel.
I didn't try the hotel spa. Just behind the hotel there were a few massage places by locals which were amazing, cheap and respectable!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1344,celebrating new baby boy,50,February 2016,"it was great experience to stay at this hotel. the room, restaurant, and the pool are really excellent and the size is big and comfortable. the location of the hotel is really in the main street of seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1345,"Beautiful villas, though ordinary services",40,February 2016,"The villas were very beautifully done with quite a large pool and both indoor and outdoor bathing area. We visited their spa as well which was also quite good. However, the food wasn't great and the tour desk wasn't of much use. We booked a taxi from them which they cancelled at the last moment.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1346,great hotel,50,February 2016,I loved this hotel. It was on the main road and yet so quaint inside. The space was green and lush and the pool was pretty. Buffet breakfast was a good spread but they should do something about keeping the tables reserved because i got up to pick up something and one of the guests sat on my table. haha,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1347,Great hotel spoiled by noisy guests,40,February 2016,"We stayed 10 nights in a one bedroom suite. The suite is a very good size around 90 sq metres and has limited cooking facilities. No kitchen utensils when we arrived but a kitchen pack was delivered promptly.
Location is perfect , the beach just a 10 minute stroll away or even quicker in the hotel's shuttle . The beach club is great and you can feel quite secure.
Good shopping and restaurants are at the door.
The suites are probably quieter than the hotel rooms as they are about a 100 metre walk from the main entrance in a separate building .
The service is excellent, the staff are helpful and always ready to help.
Now the downside... Staying in the suites was a group of young Aussie guys who made more noise than the rest of the guests combined. Loud Duff duff noise , yelling and quite a lot of swearing. We asked if the hotel could ask them to tone it down, other guests we believe also complained but the hotel did nothing , The Balinese are very humble , polite people and may have preferred not to deal with the problem but this is not good enough when so many other guests have their holiday spoiled by a few loud mouths.
Other than that we had a great stay and would recommend the Haven suites and probably stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1348,One night but Flawless stay.,50,February 2016,"It was a good experience staying in The Haven. Nice room, Nice staffs, Good Location. Requested a honeymoon set up for my room, and They did it well. We could've stay here before but it seems they are always full booked. The restaurant staff at breakfast were so helpful. Overall, would love to comeback next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1349,Honeymooners,40,February 2016,"The Haven is a lovely hotel. we stayed here for a part of our honeymoon for 4 nights. The staff members are wonderful and polite! They are very helpful too. We stayed in a haven room with really good aircon! The room was perfect only down sides were one of the room cards stopped working and our balcony was half looking at the side of the building!
Buffet breakfast was beautiful! There was a variety of food and you leave feeling very satisfied! The dinner and desert again beautiful and tasty!
Overall we enjoyed our stay and would happily come stay again!
Thank you for having us The Haven 😊",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1350,Really lovely hotel,40,January 2016,"We were fortunate to have a lovely room with balcony doors opening up onto the pool. The room itself was spacious, immaculate, large bed and had a pretty amazing stone shower. It definitely feels a bit like an oasis at The Haven with perfectly manicured grounds, trickling water, pretty lighting...
We didn't use the pool or have any meals at the hotel as we wanted to explore (meal seemed expensive here for Bali), but I would still recommend and most likely would stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1351,Brilliant,50,February 2016,"We're here at The Haven for two more nights (stayed a total of 4) and we've had the best experience so far. We were in a room that didn't have the best view so we asked about moving and without hesitating they moved us to a different room the next day. Service and staff are excellent, always acknowledged with smiley faces, restaurant is absolutely fantastic - previously being very sick on our last holiday we are very funny with what we eat, they always make sure we're happy throughout our meal. Food is fresh, great selection for breakfast buffet, hotel itself is beautiful, good location; couldn't have asked for a better stay! Thank you",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1352,Highly recommend a spacious and luxurious one bedroom suite!,50,January 2016,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our eight nights at The Haven. The hotel is basically divided into three different sections. Rooms at the front with an active and sometimes busy pool. Villas in the middle and right at the rear of the property were the one and two bedroom suites with two more absolutely beautiful pools! These pools were heavenly and very peaceful, serene and relaxing. The pools were surrounded by beautiful gardens and were in a more secluded area in which you could dreamily forget about the world for a while. Our suite was on the second floor and overlooked the pool. The suite was amazingly spacious with a separate living area to the bedroom and a lovely balcony running the length of the two rooms. (Only unfortunate thing was the couple with a child who decided to hang their washing along their ground floor balcony which wrecked the serenity and view a little every second day)
There is a rear entrance/exit to the hotel which is fully staffed and makes access easy for those staying in the suites and for the 10min walk or shuttle to the beach.
The only down side was that our suite looked in need of a bit of a make over; a fresh paint job and the bathroom had a little mould in it! Also the decking around the pool was in desparate need of repair or replacement. One last thing, it would be great if the shuttle to the beach ran half hourly instead of hourly!
The absolute high light were the amazing staff! There were so friendly and obliging! Always so positive and eager to help and even have a chat! Particularly the breakfast staff at the Lemon Cello restaurant ( I think that's the name) were just gorgeous! So good at remembering names!
Pay a bit extra and go for a suite if you would like a little more luxury and peace!
Thank you everyone at The Haven and we will be returning in June 2017 with the family!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1353,A little tired,30,January 2016,Very good staff working with a hotel that needs renovating. Loved Ryan & Ryanie - great customer service . The rooms are tired especially the bathrooms and a better area needs to be set aside for breakfast as guests were tripping over one another.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1354,Buffet heaven,40,February 2016,"Beautiful buffet breakfast. Two large pools with great sun chairs. Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and modern suites. Shower a bit average but small issue in scheme of things. Comfortable beds, great balconies and aircon. Our room cards didn't work a couple of times but staff sorted that out quickly. Free shuttle to their beach club. Great location. Highly recommend the suites!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1355,Relaxing at the Haven,50,January 2016,"Had a suite for five nights on this occasion. Excellent staff, service and amenities. Staff exceedingly helpful and always smiling. Restaurant and bar cater to a variety of tastes and at a competitive price.Will be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1356,Holiday with friends,40,January 2016,"This was our 2nd trip to Bali and on a recommendation chose The Haven this time. On the whole we really felt it is a bit of a mixed bag. We stayed in the
One Bedroom apartments in the block to the rear of the site. The room layout is excellent, we really did like it. However there is an issue with the shower, it is over the bath and not easy to get into or out of, particularly when wet, my wife had a fall the first time she used it and still has large bruises on her legs a week later, you could say the bathrooms need a good solid scrub down as there are marks easily visible. Some of the wooden fixturing in the apartment is in need of repair or replacement. The kitchen has a full size fridge which was great and we put our fridges to good use. The lounge area is a good size and having the day bed out on the deck is also a good idea and got well used in our time there. The location of the hotel is very good and being in the back of the site we found and used the rear entrance each day, you can call cabs to this entrance also, so should we go back we would ask the driver to take us to the back entrance.
The pool area is quite nice, the decking that surrounds the pool in my opinion needs replacing as it is not that solid in places, i will say I did see some people looking at this area while I was in the pool one day so maybe they are looking into this. The pool itself is not heated so there is that chilly feeling when you enter. It is an area best suited to quiet times.
I must also say we got a good deal on our rooms for the week so would say we got value for our money, we may not have been happy if we paid full list price and the venue was full.
We all found the staff helpful and pleasant to deal with. The breakfast was included in our room rate and they did make a nice hot latte which was not at an extra charge which many places do.
One tip i would have is to say don't eat at the restaurant, we did one one night and none of the four of us enjoyed our food. It just wasn't cooked that well. We found a number of great value places in walking distance.
Over all, I would say you get what you pay for & to this point we would stay in this hotel again, while the grounds are not as large as other the one bedroom apartment served us well on the couple of rainy days we had. We stayed there a week which gave us a good feel for the place and it's surroundings.
One good if not undersold thing with this hotel is if you have a late flight out on your last day they have a lounge you can use along with showers so you can freshen up before the journey home, you need to book a time for the showers but it is at no charge so is well worth using.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1357,Quiet but nice,30,January 2016,"Booked 3 nights in 2 bedroom suite late January 2016 . On check in the counter staff informed me that my credit card was no good for room service or running accounts . I found that a little surprising as another hotel in Bali didn't seem to have a problem. Probably a good thing because the food and drinks are very expensive . The room was a little run down and tired . The aircon although noisey seemed to work well . The gardens and pool areas are well maintained but I found the hole place to be lacking atmosphere. It seemed like you need to grab a taxi to get to reception from the suites towards the back . Breakfast was ok . The restaurant at the front, I think it's called sabeens was just okay not worth the expensive prices .
Would I stay here again , no I don't think I would",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1358,"Management is terrible, inhospitable and at times hostile",10,January 2016,"This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

We had been regulars of the Haven and I'm sure I reviewed it here positively a few years ago. However it is now on the family blacklist. While this hotel is well located and represents good value for money, it is terribly managed and slowly falling apart. The rooms are spacious but starting to look old and tired. In our rooms the maintenance team had to attend on 3 occasions in 2 days to deal with broken airconditioners and other room amenities. It was impossible to reach anyone from the room phone. I called guest servic, reception and room service but no one answered any call that I made. I hung on the phone for 200 rings. The only way to get service was to physically attend the reception desk and wait in a queue. As reception is around 500m from the rooms at the rear where we were staying, this was inconvenient and annoying. My frustration increased on the second day of ur proposed 3 day stay, when my room key had to be recoded to work, every time I left the room.

Although on their own these are relatively minor gripes, combined they caused aggravation that really undermined the R & R we were there for. But the clincher was a far more serious issue. The hotel had incorrectly charged us for 3 rooms for 3 nights although we had only booked and were only staying in 2 rooms. Over 2 days I discussed this with guest services on more than 5 occasions. It was clear that none of the staff had the power to resolve anything. I left numerous messages for the ""manager"" who I was variously told was at dinner, on a break, not in today.

We were finally approached by a night manager, Putra, whose aim was to convince us that somehow, inexplicably we really had booked 3 rooms. As we knew that was not correct and he knew that we weren't using three rooms, we reiterated our request that the overcharge to our credit card be reversed. He told us he couldn't actually do anything because he would need to speak to the elusive manager. He had copies of our booking.com records in his hands - just a computer printout. I asked to look at them and he reluctantly handed them over. The booking.com documents did not support what he was saying at all and when I pointed that out, he panicked and tried to snatch the papers back out of my hand. Shocked by his aggression, I stepped back at which point he grabbed at me so that he could wrestle the computer printouts of my records from me. It was a bizarre reaction; His behaviour was aggressive and inexplicable given that he only had what anyone could access on the Internet - my booking confirmation. I was forced to hand the paperwork back as I felt very threatened by his conduct. In fact we were so concerned, that we checked out on the spot, which meant that we had to pay for accommodation elsewhere.

I have contacted the Haven and booking.com to complain about our conduct and obtain a refund. No one has responded or apologised, although the charge for the third room was credited back to my card. I'm still waiting for a refund of the night we didn't stay due to their conduct.

We didn't feel safe here, let alone welcome and valued as long term customers. I'd be very wary of dealing with these people at all. There is plenty of great accommodation in Seminyak and I recommend you give this place a wide berth.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1359,Shocked,20,January 2016,"We arrived at the haven and we had booked a suite from all the reviews they seemed to have the best wrap.

The room we were given was perfect 2 bedroom but the room was not well kept floors were cracked bathrooms were full of mold and I have traveled to Bali several times and stayed in other hotel, I should have trusted the reviews and gone with my gut....how ever the gym and breakfast were amazing we stayed one night and changed hotels in them morning... staff were good tried to accommodate us with the same room that was just as bad, other things that were wrong with this room were the fridge had a dent that looked like someone had punched it mirrors were dirty lights were not fixed after they had obviously blow out for the money you are being charged here I'm sure you could find another resort that will give you what you expect.

On a positive not the grounds are extremely well kept.. I explained to the manger at the haven that this was extremely inexcusable as there advertising was extremely false she was not apologetic and replied with ""if you want 5 star go stay in Nusa dua or syminake"" I was extremely gob smacked as I was polite threw the whole ordeal all in all I would give this resort a 2/10 hope you all have a better experience then we did good luck.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1360,Great location,50,January 2016,"Great place to stay in the heart of everything. We had a suite fantastic ! Breakfast was great set you up for the day wonderful selection ! Grounds are lovely with a choice of two pool areas.
But what really makes the place special is the lovely staff who are just so attentive and courteous. Afternoon tea a surprise bonus .....would highly recommend this lovely hotel !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1361,Think for the basic services,40,January 2016,"The location is great in the Heart of Seminyak on Seminyak street, close to the famous Restaurant, Shop, massage, farmacy, mini market just across the street. And very easy to get the Taxi for the transportation.

They have categories room :
1) the haven room
2) the suite with one bed room.
3) the suite with two bedroom
4) the villa with one bed room
5) the villa with two bed room
My opinion : All the room have a good price and worth It with what you got.

The pool is lovely. There's two main pool for the haven room and the suite.

The breakfast is good. Simple but nice.

Actually i stayed for first Time in the end of November last year (2015) at the haven room for 1 night. I chose the Haven only for transit before stay to the other hotel. Wow.... It's a fabulous hotel, passed my expectation. The hotel is lovely. I saw the Villa One bed room at that time, so i decided to come again for the next visiting.

The Middle of January 2016 i decided to stay again in The Haven. I chose the Suite room with One bed room for 1 night and villa with One bed room for 2 night

Suite with one bed room (about 100 m2)
Good room, there's one room for bedroom and one room with living room + kitchen. You can cook. There's the tools for cooking.
The room have a great balcony with the bed outside, you can lying down in the balcony.
My recommendation is : choose the room in the first or second floor. Don't choose in the high floor because there's no view, you only look the coconut's leave!
My room is 215! The view is the pool.
The problem :
I disappointed about check in & out time.
I stayed on the suite one bed room on the first night, and will be change to the villa one bedroom, but the moving to the villa need to wait more longer because the hotel give late check out to the guess in Villa even I have been already in the hotel (in the Suite room) and occupancy the hotel almost 100%.

The villa with one bed room (about 200m2)
The villa is great also, with private pool, living room, small kitchen, walking closet, nice bathtub! My villa is 605, in the middle. I think 605 is the good location when you choose the villa with one bed room.
The problem : the air conditioner didn't work well. I changed to the other villa but the problem was still same.
It's very disturbing when you're in Bali with the warm weather but the air conditioner didn't work . It's mean terribly!!
The mosquito is the other problem, I think you need to spray the mosquito first before the guess stay.

What I like about the Haven?
1) Mr. Karta as assistant General manager is very helpful and kind. I can see your effort to help me when I complained about the air conditioner. Surprisingly as the assistant General Manager, he help me directly when I moved my belonging (luggage, bags) to the other villa. Very Appreciate!
2) Mr. Kadek as the villa's butler is very patient and helpful to serve me. nice to meet you!
3) almost the staff is nice. They alway smile and give the guess regard.
4) the price is very worth it with what you get! For me passed my expectation.
5) the location is great!!

What I don't like the Haven?
1) check in & check out rule/system
How can you give the late check out when your occupancy almost 100% and the guess who will stay has come.
2) the air conditioner in Villa is bad! You must change the air conditioner in Villa!

But.... I will be back to The Haven, it's recommendation hotel in Seminyak !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1362,Delightful staff are the stars of the show.,40,January 2016,"We snagged a great deal with Virgin and were very happy with the hotel and it's amenities. The rooms were clean and spacious. Sheets and towels always spotless. But the joyful, lovely staff made our visit worthwhile. We were near the front of the hotel so could hear the band in the restaurant, but they always finished promptly. Breakfast was excellent, so many choices, from Western eggs any style and Waffles, to fresh fruit and a bottomless cup of coffee.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1363,Lovely place to stay,40,January 2016,"Nice and clean, quiet towards the back of the hotel.
Customer service was fantastic, the staff were so friendly and helped me out with finding a few locations.
We had a suite, the room was decorated with rose petals when we arrived, on the bed, floor, and in the bath. Our towels were made into swans on the bed.
Room was great, we had a day bed and two chairs outside our room facing the pool, we were at the quieter end of the hotel, the front of the hotel had a lot of younger tourists, and was louder.
Breakfast buffet was great, the selection each morning was different, but very yummy.
My only qualm is that the wi-fi was really bad.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1364,Nice hotel with disappointing room- Dirty and old!,20,December 2015,"We booked a room for Christmas Eve and hoped it would be a special occasion. It wasn't. Actually, the hotel staff was great, but the room was old and dirty. The hotel is located central in semiyak, there was so many gift shops closed by. You can walk to a supermarket in 5 mins.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1365,Great Stay,50,December 2015,We stay here only one night but we really enjoyed the room they upgraded us too. We only wish that we could have stay here longer because they room was roomy and comfortable. We probably will want to stay here again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1366,"We had a great stay, but rooms need updating.",40,January 2016,"We booked a 2 bedroom suite for myself, husband and teenage daughter for 9 nights. The room is massive. Both bedrooms had king beds and impressive ensuites. The balcony wrapped around the length of the room with various outdoor sitting areas. In between both bedrooms is a large kitchen, dining and lounge area.

First impressions were great but after being in the room for 10mins you start to notice all the faults. Cracks all through the tiles, bad stains all over the kitchen and bathroom bench tops, aircons dripping on the tiles. The cover to the fuse box fell off the wall sometime during the night and smashed all over the floor, the dining chairs are so rickety they fee as though they would break if you sat on them and a piece of wood came off one of the furniture pieces when my daughters dress caught one of the nails poking out as she walked past it.

The grounds are beautiful with some great pools, although they get very little sun. The suites are at the back of the property and our particular room was the last room at the back. This meant a very looooong walk to the front lobby. If you get a suite I would suggest asking for one closest to the front.

The food in the restaurant was average at best but the breakfast was one of the best I've had over many many trips to Bali.

The staff at the Haven are the saving grace of this aging property. If not for them I may of had a more negative view of the Haven. From front desk, room service, spa staff, cleaners, breakfast staff to the security down the back entrance, everyone was personable and provided great service.

The Haven needs to think about some serious maintenance of rooms. If that happens, I would return and recommend to others. It is a great value for money property in a good central location and family friendly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1367,Dissapointing family resort stay,20,January 2016,"Pros...beautiful pool area, great location, nice breakfast.
Cons...room are so dated that they look worn out and dirty. The bathroom appears moldy although i was told it was stained, the air conditioning is useless, many rooms are located close to road or building sites so the view is blah and the noise is unbearable!
We had to move rooms because road noise along with stifling hot room made sleep impossible. New room slightly less stained but banging from nearby construction destroyed the illusion of being in a tropical resort.
There are much better resorts in Bali and Seminyak for the same price point. Dont be fooled by the photos. I think pool rooms might be nice...alas we got the construction vista.
My advice to families who require connecting rooms....stay elsewhere to avoid paying top dollar for what looks like a back packer accomodation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1368,Haven Holiday Heaven,50,December 2015,"Have just spent 3 weeks over the holiday period back at The Haven, the Hotel was vibrant and busy , and staff got into the Christmas spirit with decorations and music.
Stayed in a Junior Suite ,as always kept very clean and fresh, linens changed each day,Hotel was 100% full , staff maintained high standards in room and at the lovely breakfast.Always look forward to returning to this lovely gem , and to see the wonderful , friendly , obliging staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1369,Average stay,30,January 2016,We checked in here as a couple and were told there was only a twin room available. When we asked to speak to the manager a double room suddenly became available but we had to wait 3 hours for it to be cleaned. The room was OK wifi and air con not great and a staff member banged on our door at 9am every morning to ask did we have laundry!!not ideal when you are on holidays. Staff were friendly at breakfast but overall for what we paid the experience was not great. Good location but if you are prepared to walk it's not a high advantage.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1370,"Great Hotel, Great Location",40,March 2015,"My Wife and i have stayed here a couple of times when visiting Bali and all of their Suite's are amazing. Great location, great rooms, fairly reasonable price and also great staff.

Walk out onto one of the main strips in seminyak and you can walk to many places, or hire a scooter and make your way about Bali with ease, taking the back streets to the hotel secure carpark and up into Seminyak or further.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1371,Not a great place to stay if you like air conditioning,10,December 2015,"I was really excited about this hotel. I had booked a king room on Expedia, but on check-in, I was offered a twin. I declined, pointing to the word ""king"" on my reservation. Finally, I was given a king room...funny that one all of a sudden became available. I was tired from my flight, so I went to bed a few hours after check-in, only to be woken by a hotel staffer emptying my bar fridge. I said, ""excuse me, what are you doing?"". He said ""emptying your fridge"". I asked him why, but he didn't know why, so I said, you need to account for what you're taking then since the sheet said all the items were there, but his reply was that he didn't speak english. I told him I wanted to see his manager. He got his co-worker who said, oh I'm sorry, he meant to empty the fridge 4 rooms down. As a way to say sorry, they sent me a small fruit bowl the next day with rotten fruit. Nice touch. *sarcasm.

If you like air conditioning when you stay in a humid climate, don't stay here. The AC in this rundown facility doesn't work. About 1 or 2 times a day I had to go to the front desk to ask them to reset my AC. That worked for about 4 hours. Then I'd weak up in a humid sweat through the night. One time, I went to the front desk and she offered to change my room, so I asked, well does the AC work anywhere else....she laughed.

Restaurant staff aren't responsive. You have to stand up and wave uncontrollably to get service. I clocked a 10 minute wait for a glass of wine...there were only 8 people in the restaurant.

Wifi was spotty. The telephone smelled of dirty dish rag. Pleasant",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1372,decent price with rooms needing some fixing,30,December 2015,"we had family room, and generally clean. having said that, the air condition in our room wasn't working properly, and there were cracks everywhere on the ceilings and walls in rooms

good wifi connection

very good and attentive staffs generally.

breakfast buffet was super busy, but their service was kept at the highest. so we were totally pleased and impressed

good location, near to shops and restaurants. beach is only a 10 mins walk, otherwise, there's a free shuttle bus.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1373,Good clean and friendly,40,December 2015,"We had a good stay. Staff was friendly and helpful, even changed rooms when we complained about construction activity. Location is handy to the beach and shops.
The beach club was great, but one let down - the debris on he beach is not cleaned up. Every other beach owner cleaned up their debris (plastic bottles and rubbish) on the beach, and we had to face that while using the beach loungers - a small cost will make a massive improvement in enjoyment.
As for the hotel itself - good facilities and enjoyable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1374,staff are very friendly,40,December 2015,"this is my 3rd time i have stayed at this hotel i stay in the 1 bedroom suite room 115 the only negatives was the hotel car did not pick me up at the airport after sending them 3 emails 2 days prior to my arrival that my flight had changed and there is a new chef and if you go to buffet breakfast after 9am they seem to have some of the foods running out or waiting to get more, what has improved is now the juices and milk in the mornings are refrigrated so nice cold when you have juice at breakfast,i was sick the 2nd day there from food poising from a resturaunt not far from the haven,the staff were fantastic really looked after me called a doctor gave me iv medication and medication to take for 6 days but the 3 days in bed staff came and checked on me and offered alot of help i really like this hotel also because i am a returning guest they gave me a discount because i decided to stay a extra 4nights was there 12 nights, the room was nice and cool on arrival they offered me a cold drink and cool towel on arrival,air/con in suites need to be updated as sometimes they are nice and cold othertimes just cool in bedroom where i sometimes found a couple nights difficult to sleep most nights were good and but the hotel is showing its age rooms need renovating sun block blinds in the lounge area would be great as the light comes into the bedroom of the suite,but i will stay there again soon,great location quiet in the busy part of Seminyak walkng distance to beach and shops ect also they offer turn down service and extra free mineral water in the evenings,i would only suggestion is rooms updating air/con updated and breakfast until 11 am i stayed at the Horison hotel there breakfast is finished 30 minutes later 10,30am and the Ping hotel breakfast finishes at 11am,so extending breakfast time would be great for guest that have had a late night, even if it is just until 10.30am 11 am better",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1375,Great Hotel and lovely rooms,50,December 2015,"Stayed here for 3 nights and we had the one bedroom suite. The rooms are clean, spacious and the A/C works really well. All rooms have a spacious balcony over looking the pool. The buffet breakfast is expansive and well done. The pool area is lovely too. We found the hotel to be exactly what we were looking for, good location to shops, supermarkets, money changers, small walk to the beach and its a quiet hotel too. Friendly staff. We would stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1376,A fanastic stay at The Haven,40,December 2015,"Our stay at The Haven was only for a short 3 nights due to an absolutely disastrous night’s sleep at an accommodation nightmare! We chose The Haven over other properties purely for the fact that we had frequented the restaurant at the front many times and the location.
On arrival to the front desk the courteous staff attended to us promptly and showed us to our room.
I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the room as we had just come from an absolutely atrocious place. The bathroom was beautifully stocked and clean with the whitest of towels. Lovely cool air-conditioning and clean comfortable bed.
Our room was located at the back of the property and found this to be the best location for us as the pool was a lot quieter. Breakfast was served around the pool decking or tables situated within the restaurant.
We felt that every staff member from reception to housekeeping where probably the friendliest we have ever encountered from our 19 years of holidaying in Bali. They always greeted us with a smile and good morning, good afternoon or good evening not one staff member failed this which is a credit to the management and staff training. It’s the simple things that can make your stay all worthwhile. We love the location of The Haven as we have stayed in the Double 6 location many times and it’s walking distance to many of the beach side restaurants. I have to say that this was by far one of our most memorable stays in Bali and I can only highly recommend The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1377,"Average hotel with good location, facilities and excellent staff",30,December 2015,This hotel is located conveniently in Seminyak close to the beach and all the shops with plenty of restaurants catering to all budget and taste. The hotel rooms we booked were average however the facilities are good and staff are excellent. Continental breakfast served everyday was good with lots of options and there was usually a live band playing at dinner time which was complimented well to the festive atmosphere this time of the year.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1378,The best place to stay in Seminyak.,50,October 2015,"Upon arrival (about an hour and a half early), our suite was not available, so we went for a walk for a bit. After around two hours, it was still not available and my friends and myself were a bit antsy and exhausted due to long hours of traveling.

I'm not sure if they upgraded us or if this was the suite we were originally booked in, but, holy smokes, it was one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in: honestly, around the caliber of the Montague in Laguna Beach or St. Regis in Kauai.

Five stars all the way! Wonderful continental breakfast delivered to our two story suite with our own pool. We didn't want to leave the hotel. The manager also comped us two free massages.

Next year when I return, I will be visiting this hotel again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1379,"Great location, friendly staff.",40,December 2015,"We spent 9 days here and it was great. The location was fantastic, right in the heart of Seminyak, close to shops, restaurants and the beach. Although you are on a busy road, once you're inside, it is actually pretty quiet. The staff were fantastic, so friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble. We had a couple of maintenance issues in our room which were attended to very promptly. I would definitely recommend staying here!!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1380,Not great,30,December 2015,"We are regular visitors to Bali. Though not for a few years. Booked this hotel for first 2 nights.
Price ok. Fairly soulless resort style property. Check in was irritating. We decided to pay our extras in cash having been charged by credit card company on other occasions when leaving card as security. They informed us that because we would be paying any extras in cash they would be emptying out mini bar and that's what they did! Left an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Surprised they didn't check luggage when we left for any theft.
Cleanliness on arrival to room was passable although large clump of hair on floor was slack.
Wouldn't stay again - plenty of other, better options for similar price.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1381,extended stay at the haven,40,December 2015,my wife and i booked a 2 room suite for 6 days but were impressed with the hotel and stayed a total of 16 days .The suites are large and comfortable with good bathrooms and great beds with a selection of pillows also quiet although occupancy was low at the time . A small but well equipped gym and multiple pools for lap swims or lounging . Long stay (1 week )guests are invited to share poolside food and drinks with management each Monday . Central location allows short trip to Seminyak restaurants or exit the rear to Double 6 street for cheaper but good food,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1382,Pleasant stay at The Haven,40,December 2015,"Came here a few weeks ago and spent 3 nights at this hotel.
Overall, a satisfying stay. I stayed in the standard room and it was very spacious, with a pool looking balcony where guest can hang out and enjoying the cool breeze.
The room was nicely decorated, the shower was great, with rainforest shower. The check in was okay, we came early so only got 2 rooms, out of the 5 that we booked, readied. But this is okay since we know that we are too early, and the staff have been very accommodative in helping us keeping our luggage so we could go out and have a look around the area.

Area wise, it is located on the Legian/Seminyak area, so there are a lot of things to see and a lot of nice cafes and restaurant around to enjoy.

Breakfast was okay, not great. Variety is okay and taste is quite good. But after 2 nights I got quite bored and decided to go out since there are a lot of small and nice looking cafes around.

Although it is not by the beach, it was just a quick stroll to the Double 6/Legian beach. Less than 500m walk to the beach area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1383,Experience a poolvilla,40,December 2015,"Five years ago we stayed in one of the suites, which was a good experience, this time we booked one of the poolvilla's. Great value for money, private, secluded, comfortable, spacious and well equiped. Service is good, there is a butler service for poolvilla guests which is very convenient. Breakfast buffet has improved since our last stay, better choice, better service, except during weekends when the restatrant in the back of the complex gets to crowded. Empty bowls on the buffet, tables dirty, used plates on the tables. Could be mauch better when someone would manage the breakfast. On the whole, a great stay. Advice for the management: maintenance could be better, the pooldeck at the back of the hotel needs to be replaced en a paintjob is needed almost everywhere. And... check in at the frontdesk needs improvement.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1384,"We came, we stayed, we were pleased",50,December 2015,"Booked a stay at The Haven after reading the good reviews on TA. Turned out to be a fantastic decision !

We arrived before noon and got an early check-in as requested. There was a slight hiccup with the mixup on airport pickup which was quickly resolved. We had cancelled our pickup by the hotel some weeks back and opted to catch a cab directly from the airport instead (hotel shuttle 30k, cab from airport 17k), but this had not been properly communicated to the staff. They had initially wanted to charge us as the guy showed up, but after verifying it was not our fault, the staff politely waived the charges, much to our relief.

We opted for a junior suite in the inner wing, which was another fantastic decision. The suite was very spacious, quiet, overlooked the pool from the 4th storey and even had day beds at the balcony! Only gripe is the bath tub which is a little challenge to climb in and out... Almost slipped on one occasion!

Other pluses of this hotel is their delightful private pool which is surrounded by lush greenery. Loved swimming amidst this setting. The hotel is right smack on seminyak street which is just a walking distance from many shops and eateries. It's also a stone's throw from the beautiful seminyak beach with free shuttle services at regular 2-hr intervals.

Found out they also had daily pool and children's activities which is great if I ever plan to bring my young kids here someday. Definitely worth revisiting. And oh, they even acceded to my late checkout request of 2pm! And good wifi connection.

All in all, The Haven is a really reasonably-priced with all the perks you'd want in a hotel stay. They even have villas between the two wings for those who might want more privacy.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1385,One Bedroom Villa,40,December 2015,"Top hotel on border of Legian and Seminyak. Stayed 10 nights, fabulous location with lots of street shopping and restaurants close by, for non walkers taxi's are available on the street and inexpensive. Bintang grocery mart is 5 min walk from hotel and the beach is less than 10 min or you can take the complimentary beach shuttle. Hotel is clean and well maintained, staff are friendly and strive to ensure a pleasant stay. Buffet breakfast has a good variety of food plus egg station. Recommend the villa for extra peace and privacy.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

We even have our own modern in the room for WIFI , hooray!!! There is also a free room service breakfast for once , isn't it sweet .

For girls , what I can say for the bathroom was wonderful . the hotel provided the bath salt ,bubble gel and the aroma candle .After finished visiting the temples in Bali ,we were so tired, then we went back to the hotel and had our own relaxing time in the bathtub!

I can't say any much more for this hotel but I'm going to tell you guys to stay in a good hotel will make your trip even happier and perfect! Give yourself a chance to stay here if you can in their villa !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1387,Relaxing,50,November 2015,"I was in a haven room which included breakfast which was nice but decided to move to a room at the back which I found nicer and your breakfast is by the pool. It was an extra $10 a night. The staff were excellent. The pool guys were friendly. The resort is very clean. The spa was great. There was 3 of us and we had full body massage, hot stone massage then spent 15 minutes in a rose petal bath then a full facial. This was for 3 hours and cost $55 each. We came out glowing! Well worth every cent!! My husband and I are going back in February .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1388,Good and comfort hotel,40,December 2015,"When i visit this hotel it happen to be for leisure and business meeting.
For holiday the hotel was comfortable and easy to be find. You can walking around on seminyak road to find food and shops easily. The room was comfortable enough with nice and helpfull staff.
As for business meeting, the meeting room happen to be in the same floor with my room so it very helpfull for me.
The things that need to be improved was the business centre as a esential need for my meeting. It was a bit difficult to printing things there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1389,Good value,40,December 2015,"Being on my own for business and for a very short 5 day stay I looked for something convenient and reasonably priced. I chose The Haven because it was wonderful value for money. I was allocated a pool side room (despite only getting the chance to use it once during my stay) that was very spacious, clean and had all the amenities I needed.
The Wi-fi was also stable throughout the hotel, including my room.
Staff were always pleasant and helpful and greeted each time you passed them.
I would stay there again without a hesitation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1390,Third visit and will be back,40,December 2015,"this is the third time that we have stayed here and we will be back. We stay as a family of four in a two bedroom suite. the location is great, walking distance to the beach, great places to eat and shopping. The hotel offer shuttle to the beach and access to the beach club. Legian not too far and nice walk to Kuta along the beach. There are three pools front at the hotel and two at the back at the suites. These are shaded but provide nice relief from the sun at times. Staff are always friendly and willing to please. Breakfast has a wide selection - a great place to stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1391,Convenience and comfort for family,50,October 2015,"We booked a suite (as we have an 18mth old) which placed us at the back of the property which meant that we are about a 10 min stroll from double six beach (using the back entrance). Rooms were comfortable, spacious and clean. Kitchen was easy to work out. We had to ask 3-4 times for a microwave and cutlery as there's virtually none supplied, which is only a minor annoyance. The balcony is relaxing with day beds provided and shower and toilet are clean. There are 3 adult pools and 1 kids pool and the property including pools is maintained immaculately. Not sure what any critcisms of breakfast are about from other reviewers. The breakfast caters for asians and westerners alike and had cooks on hand to prepare pancakes and eggs of your choosing and is of the widest ranges you can imagine. We ate that much that lunch wasn't required most days. The only downside of breakfast is the bacon is always too overdone. The free beach club is a bonus and whatever cuisine you wish for is no more than a 10 min walk. Supermarket is a 5 minute walk. They hold free fitness classes also each morning (yoga, pilates, etc). The only blight on the place is the amount of mosquitoes but that wouldn't be unique to this place. They fumigate outside twice a week to try and limit the amount. Although it's a little outside of true seminyak.. its more like legian is dead easy to get anywhere. I would definitely stay here again. Even the hotel rooms at the front of the property would really not be impacted by the main road as the front rooms are set back a little. It is bali after all so there will be noise but nothing to stop you dreaming about the next day in peace. If you're using drivers to see other areas of bali... just get them to pick you up at the back of the hotel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1392,Nice but tricky,40,December 2015,"I reserved this hotel for 3 nights from Agoda.com.
I took Haven Room with breakfast which they wrote has bathtub and shower. It's very nice with the price they offerd, so I've cheked into their web and they also write one of the fasilitiy was bathtub. So I made the reservation.

But when we checking in the D day (which we arrived late in the night) I found they gave us Haven room WITHOUT bathtub. We were soooooo disapointed and we rushed to the reception to ask what happend. And what they said made me pissed off. They said NOT ALL Haven room has bathtub...I said you guys have to changed the way you promote your hotel, this is trickery that the web and the travel agent wrote every haven room has bathtub and it turns out to be not all. The staff help us by gave the twin bed haven room which has bathtub and the next day they move us again to doublebed haven room with bathtub, the room that supposed to be given for us by the time we arrived.

The first room (twin bed room) is just ok, the room look old, but I love the view from balcony and it cozy sitting outside. The bathtub plugger didn't work right. I have to cover it with glass. The next room was better.

The breakfast was great except the glass noodle. My husband found few of the hlass noodle were dry and taste like plastic.

The location is great, hotel condition is ok.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1393,Great hotel for a budget price,40,December 2015,"Really great hotel that I found through Trip Advisor. So much on offer for a really good price. Highly recommend.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite for 7 nights on the ground floor in the corner behind the breakfast kitchen.
Unfortunately it was probably the darkest and the noisest of suite rooms with noise from staff setting up from 5am. The rooms are great though. Fabulous sizes with 2 separate bathrooms. Really good for a family to kick back in. Top floors would offer the best and lightest rooms. However, I agree the cleaning could be more thorough and our big fridge was hopeless at keeping anything cold. (The freezer worked fine though. )
Room phone however didnt work. Neither phone worked in either room so I had to keep going through the operator.

Beds were so comfortable, lurved the pillows and linen. All good quality.
Breakfast was very good and varied a little daily. It may be more caotic up front in the hotel section, but the suite section was always well organised and relaxed. Room service was good but food was a little cold as it has to come so far from the kitchen out the front.
The restaurant Sabeen, in the hotel section, yes, was more expensive than eating out, but offered great food and fast service. It is a great place to sit and watch the traffic in and out of Kuta and there is security to help you cross the crazy road to get to the open all hours Circle K across the road.

The beach is about a 6 to 7 minute walk from the rear suite exit. This is also the best exit to access alot of the local eateries on quiter streets.
Out on the front, the main street is access to a great bank/money changer towards Seminyak and to the Bintang Supermarket with all fixed prices for many non supermarket items!!! Plenty of blue taxis always passing and costs $3 Australian to get down to Kuta to shop.
We used the beach club once on a very, very hot day. We are from Australia and had to wear our thongs into the water as the sand was sooo hot!! Black sand. Ouch!! We didnt use the shuttle bus at all, but walked the short distance a number of times during our stay.

The pools were great. Nice size, not too warm but the hotel pool chairs are almost always in the shade, so opt for the suite pool at the rear for sun bathing. My son really enjoying shooting baskets in the front pool. Kept him busy for ages!

Overall I was extremely impressed with what you get for the price. I would 100% recommend staying there, and next time will upgrade to a villa to get sun out by the pool and so you can have those gorgeous Bali late night swims.

Really worth the visit. 👍",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1394,Villa perfect,50,November 2015,This time we had a villa with a very private small swimmingpool. Watertemperature was lovely. The team that took care of THE villa was very friendly. Big refrigerator. Perfect Beds. Villa was very Well equiped . Breakfast was ten times better than four years ago.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1395,Great place and location for a reasonable price,40,November 2015,"Really loved staying here, just wish I had longer. I was fortunate enough to get a ground floor room that was right by the pool. I was in the front section as you walked from restaurant/reception and even though someone in their review said they didn't like hearing the music from the restaurant at night being that close i absolutely loved it. As I was there alone I enjoyed sitting on my little verandah with a drink every night with the background music playing, the band were fabulous and played lots of oldies but goodies!

One negative was the pool didn't get a lot of sun for a lot of the day until I then discovered the other pool further back which did get sun. This area had the suites and villas which I checked out whilst there. The villa I looked at was amazing and if with my husband would definitely stay in one. The suites were also great although for the price I was very happy in my cheaper 'haven room' The pools and gardens were lovely and overall the complex is lovely.

Staff were really nice and helpful, rooms were clean but could prob do with a little 'freshening up' and the Air conditioning needs to be upgraded as didn't seem to be cool enough most of the time. Aside from that, if the price is right would def stay here again as thoroughly enjoyed it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1396,You can always count on The Haven,50,November 2015,One of our favourites to stay in seminyak its so close to everything the rooms are awesome and their pools are some of my favourite in bali . I only stay here if i can get a good deal on agoda as it can get a bit pricy in peak seasons and i wouldn't want to pay more than $100 a night there . Breakfast is great service is ok i would definitely recommend .,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1397,A nice hotel that require better maintenance and house keeping,30,December 2015,"The hotel located about 10 minutes from beach, and provide facilities at the beach for the conveniences of their guests. However, it close at 5 p.m. and 5 to 7 p.m. is the best time to enjoy the beach. Should consider open for another two more hours for their guests.

We stay at suite where the rooms & living area are well design and equip.

The staffs at reception require more training, so that they can provide enough information to their guest of the facilities that provided.

Staffs at restaurants and other area are good!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1398,Very Relaxing,40,November 2015,"Returned again to this resort because it offers such great value for money. This trip i got the 1 bedroom villa with my husband. We had already picked the villa we liked on our last visit so it was disappointing when we arrived that it was not available due to air conditioning problems. We moved to another villa but were told that the problem was fixed and we can move which we did. These villas have everything you could possibly want and very luxurious. I have mentioned on every review that they need to fix lighting in bathroom thou. You cannot have a shave, put makeup even do your hair at night because it is so dark. Breakfast has def improved since last trip but don't bother having it in your villa as this is very limited. On our 4th night, the air conditioner broke down again and because it was so late at night we decided to wait until morning to get fixed, unfortunately when my husband got up to get a drink in morning he collapsed in kitchen and smashed his head and broke 2 ribs. The staff were amazing waiting in emergency for hours and checking that he was getting looked after. He suffered dehydration but this would not deter us from this resort because they were very professional and worried for his well being. Would I go back, Most Definitely.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1399,Good value,40,November 2015,"Overall it was a pleasant stay for 4 nights. We arrived at about 10:30am and we checked into our suite (two bedrooms). All the suites overlook the pool and we stayed on the 1st floor. The suite was spacious and comfortable but it was a little dated. The floors and the kitchenette's table top have crack lines and it looks like it needs a good scrub. Other than that, it was a good stay. The amenities are good. I like the balcony as there are couches/loungers that allow guests to relax at the balcony. The hotel has a lot of greenery which is relaxing. There are two pools (one located near the lobby and another one at the back of the hotel which is where the suites are at). I prefer the back pool as it is quieter. Wifi works great throughout the stay.
The staff are friendly and helpful. When we checked out, we left an item in the room and housekeeping staff found it and returned to us.
The hotel's restaurants are open-concept (i.e. it is not air-conditioned) and the buffet breakfast is okay.
The hotel is in a good location (15 mins walk to the beach or take the hotel's shuttle and lots of shops and restaurants).
I would suggest just take a bluebird taxi to get to the hotel and airport.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1400,Clean Hotel,50,November 2015,"We are happy to stay for one night at the Haven Seminyak hotel. First we booked a room from Agoda, a standard room and when we arrived they upgraded our room. Thank u so much.

Our enterance room heading to the resraurant so maybe you feel a little bit noisy at night because they have music entertaintment during Saturday night. But we are okay about that.

The room is clean and comfort, so far it was easy to find meals around the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1401,Excellent and professional serviced,50,November 2015,"Once we arrived, they informed us the extension rooms we had booked 2 months ago was fulled. Therefore they had upgraded our extension rooms into duluxe interconnected with suite room. It was great, the kids had enough room to more around since there was a living room and kitchen. The breakfast was good eventhough they do not provide halal meat however the are plenty other food we can choose from. The swimming pool was great, the staffs were friendly and very helpful. We loved staying here and would recommend our friends to stay here too.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1402,Un manager intelligente può cambiare la vacanza,40,November 2015,"Arrived at The Haven Seminiak and given our room we were quite disappointed, small and dated. The next day we had a problem with the air conditioner;

the manager Mr Sugita with expertise, professionalism and quickness has listened to our protests, tried to find solutions totally patient and no show signs of impatience. We changed room letting us do an upgrade

Allowed us so to continue to better our stay in The Haven and saved our vacation started badly.

Thanks Mr Sugita!

The Haven is conveniently located on a main street with shops and restaurants, and not far from the sea. The private beach can be reached by a short walk or shuttle service provided by the hotel

1405,Wonderful Hotel.,50,November 2015,"The Haven is a wonderful Hotel with exceptional facilities & the staff have to be the best hotel staff group as a whole we have ever experienced in all of the travels my wife & I have made over the many years!

I could not speak more highly of this hotel & its staff, the location in Seminyak is great, the room facilities could not be faulted, the rooms are spacious & have balconies overlooking a beautiful, well maintained pool.

The dining facilities are a dream & the dining room staff are exceptional, extremely well presented, very friendly & helpful & very efficient, the restaurant food was great with a good variety of western & Asian food.

We would not hesitate to stay at the Haven again if we visit Bali & I would certainly highly recommend the Haven to future travellers!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1406,Great value for money,50,November 2015,"The staff at The Haven were above and beyond friendly, and polite. From the minute we arrived, to the time we checked out, the staff were attentive without being intrusive. Little things like our 'wedding anniversary ' cake that was delivered to our room just added to the overall experience. The location is excellent, and for those that do not wish to go out to eat, the self contained suites have everything needed for dining on site. The pool area is quiet, and shady, again ideal for those seeking a relaxing break",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1407,Nice Budget Hotel,40,September 2015,"I stayed here in September 2015 with few friends. We had booked the 2 bedroom suite and it was really good for a reasonably priced hotel like this. The rooms were quiet spacious and huge, pretty clean and furniture was good too. The hotel is quiet close to Seminyak beach which I liked the most. The morning breakfast was also delicious and served variety of options. Excellent room service and not noisy at all.

1408,Impressive with great service,50,April 2015,My girlfriend and I were lucky to stay at the private villa thanks to a deal and had an absolutely amazing time there. The hotel is located 15 mins from the beach and faces a rather busy street. Yet within the hotel it was quiet with soothing ambiance. The public pool is nice and the staff was amazing and very helpful. We were offered in-villa breakfast which we enjoyed next to the indoor pool. There were a tub and two stand-in showers. The bed was comfy and the entire place was clean and well-maintained. We also enjoyed the spa service twice. All in all a very enjoyable alternative to other high-end resorts in Bali. Wish we could've stayed longer.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1409,Impressed and amazed,50,November 2015,"We were upgraded to suite with 1 bedroom, 1 living room with a pantry in it.

Nice pool, nice service nice room btw. Hotel is surrounded by a few convenient store and bintang supermarket. Breakfast is good, with plenty of selection. Hotel is clean and tidy, room is spacious. Rooms that are located at LG can be noisy. Overall experience is amazing and relaxing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1412,Good Place To Stay,40,November 2015,"I have stayed at this hotel many times on business & find it a good place to stay, its located on the border of Seminyak & Legian & is close to restaurants & shopping including the Bintang Supermarket. I normally stay in the suites at the back of the hotel which I find is a little quieter than the front. The suite rooms are very roomy as is the bathroom, they also have adjoining 2 bedroom suites which is good if you are sharing as you get a large communal lounge/dining room/kitchen room which is in-between the bedrooms. Breakfast is just okay, nothing great but its not far to walk to somewhere else if you feel like a change. I've always found the staff to be very helpful & friendly & couldn't fault the service. I guess the only downside is the 2 pools don't get much sun so if you are really into sun baking by the pool this hotel might not appeal to you, I believe they have a free shuttle running to the beach all day so that's another option, overall I'm always happy staying here & if your budget can stretch to the suites its worth paying that little extra!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1413,Relaxing stay,40,October 2015,"Stayed at the Haven 7 days at one of the suites they were great very spacious with separate lounge and balcony.Aircon was good.
The staff were great and breakfast was tasty, the gardens and swimming pool at the suites area was very relaxing.
My only negative thing to say was the WiFi was so slow and frustrating so if your there for business think twice.
I had read review on the bath shower if you were old or had a bad back getting into the shower was quite a challenge at times.
Location is great and comes with a beach club would recommend it for sure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1414,50-50,30,November 2015,"Nice location, nice swimming pool, good breakfast, balcony, but when i complained for hot ac there was no follow up for 24 hours until i pushed them then they moved me to another room on the corner of the floor verrry far away from the lift...
I wasnt happy about it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1415,Excellent value.,50,October 2015,"This is my second time staying at The Haven. This time we stayed in a one bed suite and would definitely not go back to the normal room. The suites are much larger, in a better part of the hotel with no noise and they have lovely outdoor loungers.

The hotel itself is in a fab location in Seminyak, 5 mins walk to double six beach. There's a shuttle too and the hotel has a lovely private beach area. It's never full.

Breakfast is ok, nothing special. It's a bit chaotic and badly organised.

The rooms are really big and the bathrooms are big too, we had a huge living area and kitchen. The hotel seriously needs to up their game in the housekeeping dept. The bathrooms were not as clean as I'd expect but nothing worth complaining about. I just know they aren't given a proper deep clean, it's all cosmetic. The bedding was changed every day, it was just the bathroom could do with a good scrub. For a few nights it was fine.

The spa is great, I went twice. Book online when you reserve you're room, it's a quarter of the price. The massages are top notch.

Staff at reception are not of the balinese charm variety, very busy and a little rude. My airport transfer wasn't booked correctly. But if you stay in a suite you get to use a separate reception to the main one and they were a pleasure to do deal with.

If you're trying to decide where to stay and you're on a budget then pick here. Location is unbeatable, the rooms are massive. Price is really good value for what you get and the beach area and pools are fab.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1416,Holiday,40,July 2015,"My wife and i stayed at 3 diffrent motels during our trip in bali and we saved the haven for last as it was the derest and flashest looking of our motels we stsyed at.

We booked a suite for 4 days on the top floor. As first impression as we walked into the room was KEWL we had our own little kitchen, lounge and bedroom with en suite. The room was very clean also and we had a verand off the lounge and bedroom which looked down over the pool there was outside couches for us to chill on whoch was used alot.

We found the restrsunt food was dearer than the other motels we stayed at which was stink but it was still nice to eat. The buffet breakfast was great with lost of diffrent foods to chose from.

There are 2 pools 1 at the front of the complex and 1 at the back we found during our stay most the kids use front pool and couples used rear so that made things more relaxing er as no 1 wants to listen to kids wen u are on holiday haha iean that in a nice way.

The staff was polite and motel is nice and close to shops its also only about a 15min walk to beach. The motel have a shuttle which takes u to the beach and u can use Beach seats they have reserved for motel stayers. Which is very handy.

The motel also has a very nice spa avaliable to stayers but we never tried.

Overall i highly enjoyed my stay and would be happy to recommend to other's.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1417,Pleasant Experience,40,October 2015,"We stayed in the one bedroom suite overlooking the pool on the 4th floor (Thank you Ria).
The amentiies were extremely good, Beach Club and exercises beside the pool in the morning.
The room was clean and the staff extremely helpful ~ Give it a go, I will definitely return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1418,Fantastic location and experience,40,November 2015,"My partner and i stayed for 4 nights, thoroughly happy with the reception and staff were quick to attend to requests.

Room was really clean and housekeeping did a great job everyday, we felt safe with our belongings left in the room. There were a couple of mozzies here and there but wasn't major.

Breakfast every morning was pretty decent, quite a variety of food and very attentive waiters and waitresses. they have a live band almost every night and they are so amazing.. we would just listen to them from our hotel balcony.

we were on the 2nd floor so it was a little noisy late at night when people were having a party by the pool or even on their balconies.. and the fiddling around in the morning with staff setting up would be a little annoying if you are a light sleeper.. in that case you should go for a room higher up.

Overall really happy with the place and the spa they have at the back is also pretty fantastic.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1419,Mini break getaway,30,November 2015,"Literally booked this hotel on the day were flying due to its location. Last time we came to Bali I had a private villa and pool at another resort for an extra £100 I could of again I wish I had!
Location great not far from the beach, restaurants and shops. Staff really friendly and helpful. However the room wasn't that great. Breakfast was included in my deal and I thought it was fine.
The aircon just worked in front of the door , although turned down to lowest temp the room was a constant toasty 28 degrees. The cleanliness of the room was that great either the floor needs a good scrub and I could see dusty cobwebs in the shower.
I read other reviews saying the hotel is tranquil please note if you get main entrance side and not pool side it isn't, it's noisy. Constant traffic, voices and in the evening between 7- 10 the hotel cabaret singer belting out classics such as ""let in go""!
The hotel isn't the worst I have been to but could be so much better if the detail was looked at.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1420,2nd time back with young family,40,October 2015,"Two bedroom suite was ideal for our 8 yr old son, 5 yr old son and 3 yr daughter. We visited in late October, pools were good temperature, rooms clean and modern (not 5 star but still good quality), and breakfast buffet is fantastic (one of the reasons we came back). If you are looking for good family atmosphere, we have always found the front pool to have a variety of friendly visitors. Location is good if you like a little hustle and bustle, and 10 minute walk to the beach, or 10 minute (depending on traffic) ride to a number of great restaurants.
we booked directly - which I think is the best way to do it, but we did meet other guests who booked via expedia who got a great deal on flights & accom for a standard room. We'll be checking this out next time.
The only think I found a little disappointing was that some of the deals offered are given regardless the length of stay. We stayed 15 days and I would have thought that warranted some sort of better offer (or extra food & beverage voucher) vs a shorter stay (eg 3 days).
Overall, I would highly recommend this place for families (particularly the suites).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1421,Amazing value for money!,50,October 2015,"We enjoyed our stay at the Haven. Amazing value for money, with fantastic wifi. Staff were amazing and so quick with any request we had. Fantastic staff member assisted us to our room and helped us with any queries we had. Will be staying here in the future and recommending! :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1422,Great location,40,October 2015,"I stay here when I am doing business in Seminak. It is ideal for central location and it has a parking garage which is a big plus. The area out front is always kept clear for drivers so getting in and out is a breeze. I have been staying here for last six years and I come once a year. The rooms are getting run down. Cracks in tile. There is a bad smell at around 5 pm not sure what that is about. The telephone system really needs replacing, as it is very old and not reliable. The wi-FI is getting better not worse! The service at the front desk is still very difficult with most workers not understanding English. I left something in the room and when I called they said they found it but when I went back to get it it took 45 minutes for them to understand and retrieve the item.The breakfast is still very very good and one of the main reasons for high rating. Service in AM breakfast is very good.I Still feel for the price it is a very good option for the business traveler, but they will need to re-model the rooms in the front of the hotel very soon. Not sure about the suites or rooms in back as I always stay in the front.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1423,The suites are a must,50,October 2015,"Property is in a great location short walk to Bintang supermarket with many shops and restaurants very close by. Is in the heart of the craziness of Seminyak. We stayed in a suite which is more like a small apartment with the pool right outside.Breakfast was quite good and the service was great. the pool was fantastic and the most comfortable sun lounges, was really lovely little spot to be. There are 2 pools in the hotel but the one out the by the suites is by far the best and most relaxing. Great location to base yourself for access to Legian / Kuta and all the gorgeous restaurants around Seminyak. If you are looking for peace and quite this is not the location to be, as once you step outside the hotel it is a world of craziness.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1424,Just the right place for a relaxing week,40,October 2015,"I stayed at the Haven in Seminyak for a week. It always goes without saying that the Balinese people are very friendly and the staff were great, very friendly and always helpful.

Seminyak is so much busier these days than it used to be, but the Haven was a quiet and tranquil place to relax and enjoy the surroundings. The pool area is lovely, and my hotel room was comfortable with the balcony overlooking the pool. The bed and pillows were just fantastic - very comfy and soft!

I did have a couple of problems with the air conditioning leaking, my balcony doors not locking correctly, and my key card needed to be reset on 3 occasions, but these were all handled promptly and with courtesy, so they did not become major issues.

The hotel is starting to become a little ""tired"" in terms of decor, however, the Haven is not The W, and it does not command W pricing. And I believe that you usually get what you pay for - and the Haven provided great value for the price I paid.

My overall opinion is that it's a great place to stay at a reasonable price, in a central area close to Double Six and the beach. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1425,Bad start but excellent recovery!,40,October 2015,"I chose this hotel based on reviews mostly. I booked a standard room for a couple through Agoda. When we got there the lady at the reception told me and my partner we had to sleep in a twin room for a night and move on another with king size bed the next night. Not a good start. After that a guy from the reception broke our bottle of liquor we just purchased. When we got back to check in an hour later the guy who accidentally broke our liquor bottle managed to recover the damage exceptionally: He upgraded us freely to the hotel suite room. It was a beautiful huge room with swimming pool view. The service staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location, close to restaurants and bars and to the beach. Would definitely go back. Excellent damage recovery.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1426,Great value,40,October 2015,We stayed here for 2 nights before going to the Gilis. I had no expectations as we just wanted somewhere cheap it was a lovely surprise first we got upgraded to a suite which was very nice. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The location is great your straight in the thick of it and we found a great little restaurant just round the side street warung murah. This place I highly recommend it certainly was lovely and I'd stay again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1427,Maintenance please........,30,October 2015,"The location is the biggest value of this hotel, it' s a busy hotel in the hustle bustle of Seminyak .suroundung by cafes, shops, spa..anything you want. I was stayed in the first floor, is was very noisy.I think the rooms are always occupied so the maintenance is low. The floor needs to clean down. The important one is the shower room is unclean many stains, and when we take a shower the water will come over to the room..makes flooding. So please pay attention to maintain.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1428,"Good location for 2-3 night stopover if you can get a cheap deal,",30,October 2015,OK for a short stopover if you can get it on a cheap deal on hotel booking web site Not a place I would stay for a week not a resort hotel pool too small and not enough sun gets to the loungers. Not enough privacy between room and en suite. Rooms have poor soundproofing you can hear the music from the hotel bar. Departure lounge too expensive $28 US to have an area to wait in for a couple of hours other resorts have this for free,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1429,Excellent Accommodation at Excellent Location,50,October 2015,"I had stayed there for a night, due to a business trip. I choose this property, because I need to experience a night life of Kuta, Bali; hence I can get the best location and the best access to move around for my business purposes in Bali. The hotel had been more then 5 years operated, with wood and warm design. There is always a room to be improve, but I was blind by the service that the staff offers at anytime.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1430,Good hotel,50,October 2015,"Good hotel, nice room, perfect shower. Nice restaurant and pool too.
Water in the room was a bit overpriced!
Close to shops and everything. But traffic is very heavy if u wanna go anywhere else, more than a hour to get there from the airport. Make sure to get a motorbike, if u don't get a motor bike it is hard to get to places fast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1431,2 bedroom suite,40,October 2015,Unfortunately I would've rated 5 stars but we did have major set back at check in. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 4:30pm so we had dinner up in the restaurant and then returned to finally settle my toddler at 7pm but when I got into the room the baby cot wasn't there! I had been in touch and confirmed arrival time and baby cot. It finally arrived by 8pm. After this initial slow start to the holiday we really enjoyed our HUGE room and hotel experience. And will return.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1432,Great Seminyak Restaurant,50,October 2015,We went to the haven for dinner and loved it. We went on a Friday so we got the meat buffet. The food was great. You told a man what meat you wanted and he cooked it perfectly. The service was also very nice. The waiters were very friendly. There was also a band playing that was very good and could actually sing. I would go back to The Haven!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1433,lovely hotel,50,October 2015,"My family and I recently stayed at this hotel in two of the one bedroom suites for two nights. We loved our stay here, the rooms were generous size with a kitchenette and full size fridge. I will be staying here again for sure. Location is very good, just down the road from bintang supermarket and a short walk to the beach. The only downside is the prices of food and drinks are quite high in the hotel..however if you have a suite and a full-size fridge you can always buy your own food and drinks. The staff were very friendly and spoke excellent english, any issues we had were fixed without any problems.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1434,"Great Rooms, great location.",50,October 2015,"We've stayed here a few times, not because we don't like to try new things, but because its hard to look past the balance of value, comfort and location. The suites are great. Well designed and spacious. Wifi is reasonable, though there are occasional periods of slow-down. Its certainly better than it was a couple of years ago.
Its walking distance to a great number of shops and restaurants in the legian and seminyak area, including Bintang Supermarket. Recommended.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1435,Satisfied,40,October 2015,"Located in the central of Seminyak, easy to access and near from anything you need. The hotel is good, so does the room. The room is clean and tidy. The linen and also bed are also clean. The bathroom is also nice and clean. The hotel has 2 pools in the front and back. Both are clean and nice. The breakfast was just okay. The food was fresh but nothing special on it. I love the variety of food. We stayed in 4th floor, and unfortunately the view is another building. We kind of disappointed about it, but regarding to other aspects, it was fine. My friend who also stayed there on the LG floor showed us the room and it was nice. The LG room has direct access to the pool but there are mosquitoes on evening if you keep the door open

Overall, the hotel was nice. The staff was friendly. But we have difficulties in contacting the reception",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1436,Central,40,October 2015,Very central location in busy Seminyak. Room was clean and comfortable overlooking the pool. Friendly and very helpful staff. We only stayed one night on a stopover but would have easily stayed longer.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1437,"Best location, bed need replacement",40,August 2015,"Great location.
Bed need to replace, looks tired so not comfort enough. Room is nice, clean, and perfect size. Have 2 standard pool.
Breakfast is okay for 4 stars standard.
Overall, great choice for 4 star within seminyak area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1438,Amazing,50,October 2015,"We stayed 1 week in the haven and I can not speak highly enough ! We stayed in a suite and it was beautiful, over looked the pool. I liked that the ""suites"" side of the hotel got their own pool , was so relaxing! The staff were just so lovely and we forgot our credit card on our trip and they still let us stay ! They have their own little set up on double six beach which was lovely. This hotel is huge ! Two pools, two restaurants , back and front entrances. I will defiantly stay there again .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1439,Very Relaxing,50,October 2015,"We found the staff very friendly. Our rooms were spacious. The afternoon club room was an added bonus also the Beach Club with a ride down available ever 2 hours with
Lounges,umbrellas, towel and cold face wash waiting for you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1440,Bad Hotel. Will never be a 4-star!,10,October 2015,"This hotel is so disappointing. From check-in to room service, cleanliness and check-out. Most of the staff are rude (specially the operators/call center agents). We didn't have an adaptor when we came and we badly need to charge our phones. Called the operator and she said ""Wait, we don't have enough staff, we'll deliver after someone is available""

Waited for 10mins, one guy came with an adaptor. But boom! It's not working... We called the operator again, and she said ""Sorry ma'am, if not working, you can buy at mini-mart, it's 24hrs""... Then I asked: ""Why ya'll never checked before giving it to us?"" She didn't answer. Very very good. We are so tired from 2 flights then you trained your staff to talk like this?

The room is old. They know that we requested for a higher floor room with a view. But they gave 3rd floor with a ""wall"" view- no view at all. Anyways, I won't recommend this hotel and we are not coming back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1441,Heaven on earth!,50,September 2015,"I was able to get a really good deal on one of their pool bedroom villas and was looking forward to it because it would be the end of my 4-week trip through Bali and Lombok. I already knew the location of this hotel is excellent because I stayed in the area at the beginning of my trip.
Check-in was frustrating, long wait, and little communication on the status of the room. It wasn't ready ( I arrived before 3 pm) and was told to come back after 3. When I came back someone escorted me to the villa and explained everything. It was beautiful beautiful beautiful...
A nice pool with 2 lounge chairs, great bedroom, living area and a stunning bathroom including outside shower. I loved it!
The breakfast buffet for suites and villas is served in a separate restaurant at the back of the hotel and it was more than sufficient for me. It could get a bit busy.
They also have a lounge for guests staying in suites and villas where they serve snacks and small drinks for free every day from 4-6pm. It was a very nice touch and hardly anybody there.
Throughout my stay the service was excellent, the wifi was very fast and it was hard to leave the villa. If you're able to get a good deal and are willing to spend a little extra for a great amount of luxury then this is the place to stay. It doesn't get any better than this :-)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1442,Wonderful stay,50,September 2015,"Excellent hotel. My wife and I stayed in a villa and thoroughly enjoyed it. Great pool and outdoor area, comfortable bed, great facilities. Exceptional service from all staff and I specifically mention Dayu ( guest relations) and Madi who looked after our villa. Quality breakfasts and free afternoon tea with delicious canapés for suite and villa guests. Hotel convenient to everything in Seminyak and shuttle to beach. Great stay - we will be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1443,Great stay again,50,August 2015,"Spent 3 weeks at The Haven , in August.Upgraded to a well appointed and clean suite, great beds and clean towels.
Can't fault this Hotel ,staff are always very friendly and willing to offer assistance , Ms Dayu is a gem and always willing to help with a beautiful smile,breakfast is very adequate with plenty of choices each day.
Shuttle service to the beach was efficient , and beach area well maintained with a cold shower provided.
August was a very busy month and the Hotel was very busy,
Maybe a bit of noise control at nite from security would help with an uninterrupted sleep, realise people enjoy a party but a couple of nites other guests were extremely noisey and inconsiderate.
Look forward to returning to The Haven in a couple of months.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1444,Serenity in the heart of the hustling bustling Seminyak,50,November 2014,"Stayed in the Suites for my parents wedding anniversary, and amazed with the top notch service of the hotel staffs. The hospitality, and the surprise they did for my parents. What an amazing stay. Moreover, Seminyak in such a hustling bustling area, but The Haven have successfully built the serenity atmosphere [especially if you stay at the Suites], it has no noise at all. The pool is such cool one,with lots of trees. The breakfast is great and delicious, they even had the homemade jam. The lounge is open for the suites guests, offering afternoon tea.
Overall, it was a great experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1445,Not the best.,20,September 2015,"I had a two bedroom suite, the room was a great size, but that's were the compliments stop. Wifi, really bad. Room service was poor. Cleaning was also rates low. If your looking to enjoying a cocktail at the pool at the end of the day you will be disappointed because there is no pool side bar. The breakfast is also average. Bali is known for its Buffett breakfast but not at the Haven. The shuttle bus to and from the beach good idea if they can get through the traffic, they didn't whilst we were there. Sorry but there are better places you could stay 😔",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1446,""" A Hidden Gem""",50,September 2015,"This Hotel is five minutes from the beach in one of the best locations in Seminyak .
Would strongly recommend a stay here and would suit everybody needing a hotel room to Hotel Suites one or two bedrooms or those who prefer Grand Villas. We stayed again in a two bedroom Suites that offer great amenities from shuttle down to The Haven Private beach right on Double Six beach or have a fab Spa .The Service is always outstanding and offers guests all the privacy they deserve with help always on hand. Make sure you try the great burgers here of all things with a cocktail at the front bar watching the action go by on the road ,can be a great laugh seeing the interactions with taxis and constant foot traffic",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1447,"Respect privacy, pls!",20,September 2015,"We stayed abt 4days here in room 3024. Everythings gone good at first but bit dissapointed bcause cleaning service or i dono maybe another staff let a stranger come to our room with master key and without our permission in the morning!! We know her actually, but we didnt feel like to met. Respect our privacy pls!
And about the security, when I came back from bar with my hubby, he asked my id but he just let my hubby going.. I dono if security really that care, do I really like a prostitute? I was with complete clothes on anyway. I forgot to asked his name.
The restaurant so expensive with awful food taste.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1448,The perfect place to relax!!,50,September 2015,"The Haven is in an excellent location with good quality facilities, great service and very friendly staff. We stayed recently for 6 nights, with an upgrade to a one bedroom suite. The suite was huge with good facilities and a large balcony. The kitchen facilities are a bonus if required, along with a separate living area and very comfortable bedroom and bathroom.
The restaurant food was very tasty, as was the ample buffet breakfast each morning.
The suites building is at the rear of the property, which offers a quiet environment and very relaxing pool with plenty of shade.
The shuttle bus to the hotel's beach club area was a welcome addition and the beach facilities of deck chairs, umbrellas and towels were really appreciated.
The only slight issue in the suites was the ""up & down"" quality of the Wi Fi connection, which at times was quite poor, but always better at the reception area of the property. You could easily access the web via the complimentary PC at reception.
We would certainly stay here again and thoroughly recommend the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1449,So NOISY!,20,September 2015,"We have been a quite regular client at this place, however, this time, the suites were fully booked and we had to stay at the hotel side. Noisy, noisy thing that makes you sleep less not to mention difficult to have a wonderful late morning(s). They even charged you directly just few hours after you book through booking.com. Suffice to say, we aren't coming back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1450,Mrs,50,September 2015,"I had a wonderful time at the Haven.
I was thrilled to get an upgrade to a suite.
This was my first stay but I will be definitely be booking again when I return in February. With my family. I loved the shuttle bus service down to the beach at double 6, breakfast was great. A nice walk to some of my favourite tailors.
Very happy with the service two pools and overall friendliness of the staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1451,"Great location, clean, friendly staff",50,September 2015,"We stayed for 8nights at the Haven which is located off of the main shopping street in Seminyak.
We stayed in the executive suite which was well furnished, very clean and spacious.
We had our own private balcony consisting of a day bed, which was great for those lazy afternoons.
The hotel is exactly like the photos, beautiful pools and grounds.
Breakfast was $12 AUD a day per person, which was an all you can eat buffet, including waffles, bacon &eggs, fruit and more.
We ate several times at The Sabeen restaurant attached to the hotel and again found the food delicious and well priced.
Transport was also easily organised by the hotel.
Overall a clean, reasonably priced hotel which made a perfect place for a couples/family vacation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1452,a huge letdown,30,September 2015,"i arrived at the hotel early around 11am and was to the room wasn't ready,which was fine as checkin is usually 2pm,we were booked into a 1 bedroom apartment and i had asked for twin beds when i booked as i was travelling with my 24 year old son,they told me they didn't have a twin room so after lots of discussion they agreed to put in a single bed,but only for 3 days and then we would have to move to another room,i asked why they couldn't just keep us in this room for the 7 night stay and they wouldn't budge so we had to change rooms after 3 days which is a hassle. The rooms are looking very tired and cracks all over the place,the bath is rather dangerous as it is hard to get in and out and the shower is in the bath also there was no hot water in the second room,the first room was only luke warm and it was very hard to adjust,also lots of mozzies in the rooms and i think that is from the happy plant in the bathrooms that sit in a large vase of water,which seems to be a breeding ground for them, the beds were very comfy and the pillows were lovely. i have been to this hotel on 3 previous occasions and it has gone downhill also i was at the pool and taking to a lady who had the same issue with the bed and they just split it for her,i don't know why they couldn't do that for me",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1453,"Lovely hotel, good location",40,September 2015,"The only reason I have given very good rather than excellent is we arrived back on the Friday to a letter advising us that there is a problem with the pipes therefore they were going to have to move us to another hotel! My friends had to go and talk to the manager to sort this out. When two of my friends arrived the weekend before, they were told it was overbooked and had to be put up at another hotel. However, the good news on this was my other friend and I got upgraded to a suite as compensation, so that was handled well.

My friends who had stayed at the Haven several times, booked this for a reunion as we had not seen each other for 20 years, and it was a good call. The suite was spacious, great views of the pool area at the back. It is in a great location and is cleaned everyday. The breakfast was amazing and the staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble.

It was close to the beach but if you didn't want to walk there was a golf cart that took you there and picked you up and they had their own area at the beach which were manned and when you arrived, you got a towel and a cold facecloth. There was a restaurant next door to get food or drink and use the toilet.

Would absolutely recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1454,Haven not heaven,20,September 2015,"Had a very bad experience checking in at the Haven, we arrived on Friday 18th September 2015 at 4pm, after checking in and taking my credit card for surcharge, they directed us to the lounge to wait for our room. After about 30 minutes they sent a young man over who told us that they only had one nights accommodation, keeping in mind we had booked and paid for a twin room which was confirmed in advance, they said it was due to water pipe problems but we believe they just oversold the rooms as has happened before. We said this was unacceptable and another 30 mins past before eventually offering us a room with 1 bed which was not nice on lower ground floor. Management were rude and offered no compensation for the ordeal. The other hotel was inferior and not in a good location. Will not be returning and will be warning others of this scam. There was no water pipe problem that we saw during the stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1455,"Great location, good price, excellent service!",50,September 2015,"Located at the border between Legian and Seminyak, you're just 10-15 minutes walking from the beaches. Lots and lots of restaurants, bar & pubs nearby you just need to walk to go there.

It was my second stay in the hotel and I really feel that their service was excellent, booked via ag*** with a very reasonable price. Check in process takes about 5 minutes and our requests in the booking was all fulfilled.

Choice of food also great, most of the food tasted good, the Sabeen restaurant is also a nice place to eat.
Pool was nice, view from the room was okay, room is very light if you open the shades (which is good if you have small children with you) amenities was also nice.
I will return again for sure",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1456,"Excellent staff, central location",50,August 2015,"After extensive research, a friend and I chose The Haven for a 1 week girls' trip from August 25th. Initial email correspondence was a little slow, but we were pleased with the rate and inclusions we were offered.
After airport pick-up, we checked into a Haven room late at night. We noticed that the lock on the sliding door to the balcony was broken, so a tradesman was sent up immediately to fix the problem.
Breakfast was excellent - served until 10am each morning.
We were blown away by the friendliness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Staff members greeted us warmly everywhere we walked. Atma, the day spa, was exceptional - particular thanks to Martha and Rini. After having a manicure, I was even escorted back to my room to avoid ruining my freshly painted nails.
After negotiating an upgrade to a beautiful 1-bedroom Suite on the second day, my friend needed to fly home unexpectedly to be with her ill child. Fortunately, staff were very understanding of this situation and agreed to refund the upgrade cost (this has taken 3 weeks to come through, which was a little frustrating).

Overall, we were very pleased with The Haven. There are room options to suit every budget - from the standard Haven rooms, through to the suites, and villas. It's an easy 10 minute walk to the beach, and 5 minutes from the Bintang supermarket. There are convenience stores directly opposite and beside The Haven - very handy any time of the day. The tour desk can also arrange tours and drivers for guests. The security guards were fantastic - I felt completely comfortable, even when heading out by myself at night - and they help you cross the busy road by stopping the traffic too.
Would recommend :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1457,"2 bed, 2 pool private villa is amazing!",50,September 2015,"I have stayed at the Haven a few times now, only ever in the one bedroom private pool villas. They are amazing, however, the 2 bedroom villas are incredible, so spacious, private and the double level pool is heavenly. Highly recommended! The staff are wonderful and the Atma spa is beautiful, best hot stone massage ever. The location is very convenient but honestly in your own pool villa you'll never want to leave!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1458,Enjoyable peaceful stay in modern hotel,50,September 2015,We spent the first two night of our Bali visit in the haven and got an upgrade for our room to a suite. Which was great but the shower did not work. Bath was fine tho. There are two very enjoyable pools and the location is excellent next to great bars and restaurants.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1459,Booked from travel agent for the best price,50,April 2015,"I booked the hotel from travel agent, this hotel was recommended by my best friend. I got up grade to suite , wow it's very nice, spacious room with living room and pantry, very spacious balcony. Only ten minutes to the beach. They have shutle for free just check the schedule",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1460,Good location,40,September 2015,"The hotel is good in general but some rooms are not well maintained. However, the villas and the suites look good ""because separate building"" the room has a sewage smell ""which is not so bad"" only sometimes.
The food is not the best in Bali, the breakfast is OK.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1461,Good Hotel,40,September 2015,"Not a bad hotel, centrally located. Rooms are a little run down but they are clean and tidy. The hotel offers a beach club with reserved sun loungers, very nice touch...the airport transfer was a little unorganized, just catch a taxi!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1462,Lovely Haven in busy Seminyak,50,September 2015,"We stayed in a suite at the Haven for 9 days and enjoyed it very much.
The hotel is situated in my favorite part of Seminyak, away from the madness as you get down towards Jalan Laksmana. The front of the hotel is on Jalan Seminyak with a bar and restaurant at the very front. The first section is hotel rooms which didn't look very appealing. The pool in this part is always busy and doesn't seem to get a lot of sunlight. Once you head down past this along a walkway past the villas you get to the suites. These are in two 4 storey blocks with lovely gardens and 2 swimming pools between them. The suites comprise two huge rooms, each with a balcony (day bed on one), TV in each room, comfortable couch and armchairs, dining table and a full sized fridge if you want to stock up from Bintang supermarket just down the road. They are nicely furnished, clean and very well maintained. Large modern bathroom with a shower over the bath. This was quite difficult to get into as the bath was high with a wide surround. You needed a reasonable level of agility to get in and out. There is a safe in the cupboard and plenty of space for luggage and clothing. Another restaurant at the rear offers a decent buffet breakfast and provides free afternoon tea for the suite guests. There is access to Jalan Double 6 at the back. The hotel offers a shuttle to take guests to the beach club every two hours and a special area for guests to use while waiting for a late departure. They charge so much for this that I seriously doubt any-one would make use of it. Food in the restaurants was okay but with so many great restaurants all around, especially the wonderful Pearl in Double 6, there is no need to eat there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1463,Perfect Location,50,June 2015,"The Haven was in the perfect location for shopping, massages and the beach. My friend and I stayed in the 2 bedroom suite and it was so spacious. Not a lot of restaurants around but a taxi ride to the other side of Seminyak was about $3! The breakfast every morning was amazing full of a beautiful variety of dishes and everything was cooked fresh. We also ate in the restaurant at dinner time and the food once again was delicious and we enjoyed the Balinese dancing show while eating. The staff are so beautiful and helpful. Would definitely stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1464,"Nothing special for the Suite room its take along walking from my suite room and the amenities not complet,",20,September 2015,"nothing special for the suite room its take along walking from the main street and also the amenities poor, theres no toothbrush, me and my child have to walking 200 meter to receptiont and main street which theres seminyak store, nothing special i dont wanna stay at this hotel anymore",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1465,Glenn,50,August 2015,"Great location ,friendly staff and breakfast was fantastic. Going back in December with the family. Staying in the suites this time which our friends stayed in last time which were spacious and had everything. Could do with some bowls in the room when entertaining especially in the suites.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1466,Always a favourite.,40,September 2015,"We have stayed at The Haven 5 times now. It is in the Perfect location, The food is great any time of day. Good Breakfast with plenty of variety and always freshly cooked. Nice pool maybe a little small and not a lot of sun but this also can be viewed as a bonus. More for couples without children and not really a child friendly pool. We have stayed in both the Hotel and the Suites and both are good. The bed seem a little softer than many in Bali, so this is also a bonus. Staff are very polite and professional and the Spa Treatments are amazing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1467,Nothing Special - Look at other better hotels nearby,10,August 2015,"I would look elsewhere instead of staying at this hotel. Ive often seen this hotel on all my trips to Bali and decided to plunge in and see what it was all about

My qualms with this place:
-The bathroom is old and needs renovation
-Limited amount of sunbeds to lay on
-The food is below average (There were flies buzzing around some of the food)
-The room just feels older than it appears in the photos (So, a let down)
- I asked for a later check out, They asked me to pay full price (Despite the hotel being virtually empty) It just feels like they are milking every dollar from you (Turn off!)

- When you walk out the hotel, it is just dirty and traffic everywhere - Unpleasant
-VERY slow WiFi that barely worked at the best of times (Staff did not care)
-Expect children EVERYWHERE

I will not return

I'm not saying the stay was horrible, I'm just very underwhelmed by it all considering the price I paid. If I was you, I would pay that extra 20-30 bucks a night and stay in somewhere beautiful instead of this below average place",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1468,Overall great stay,40,September 2015,"We initially thought the hotel was small from the outside but we were blown away once we walked inside. The location is excellent as it is located along a busy street with a 24 hours convenient store located right opposite the hotel, and many shops and restaurants along the street. The staff in general were friendly. We stayed in the one bedroom suite which was located right the back of the hotel in another building, which was more quiet and private, and had our separate pools, restaurant for breakfast and also a check-in/check-out desk. The room is just nice for 3 people (we requested for an extra bed which they placed in the living room). The room was nice and the beds were comfy but they need to work on the cleanliness of the bathroom. The hotel also provided free shuttle service to the beach every 2 hours at the back entrance, which we were not informed of and only found out by ourselves on our last day there when we decided to check out the back area of the hotel. You could also take a 10mins walk to the beach if you do not wish to wait for their shuttle service. My mom also went for their spa package which she said was really good and worth the money. The only bad experience I had with the hotel was that I did not have a smooth check-out. The hotel charged me for room service in my final hotel bill which I did not request for. The staff told me that the food was sent to my room but when he showed me the room service receipt, a different room number was written on it with someone else's name and signature on it. So I could not understand why would he even asked me if that was my name and signature on the room service receipt when it was obviously not sent to my room? Took the staff about 15mins to check with the restaurant and came back to the reception desk. That same staff did not say anything to me or apologise about the blunder they made but instead another staff apologised to me for the mistake. I only find that one staff really unprofessional. Other than that I had an awesome stay and I wouldn't mind staying here again if I were to visit Bali again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1469,Very BAD!!,10,September 2015,"Nothing was right since we got here. We have booked an upgraded room to 1bedroom suite to cater us. The price we paid was premium. When we got here, the bath drainage did not work. Housekeeping took hours to get to our room. When they did the job they do was basically disgusting. A lot of rubbish stuck under the blocked drainage. It was smelly and so dirty. The next fault we have found was that the plug for the sink was broken. Complaints have been made, no respond. The food display in the Lemon Cello restaurant was full of ants! We ended up having bad diarrhea. Again, all they said was to complaint to hotel manager, which we have done. No apology token was given. The worst incident was when we found out that our son has actually been bitten by bed bug!! I ended up making a real fuzz about it and demanded the housekeeping manager to change all bedding again and vacuum all carpet and sofa, which apparently was not done on daily basis.

We are very disappointed with this hotel. They claimed to be 5 stars hotel but the fact it is less that Melati class.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1470,Surprisingly pleasant,40,June 2015,"The price is right for what you get. If you don't mind stepping out into one of the craziest busy streets in Legian/Seminyak, you are in for a treat.
The check in was not so smooth: the girl behind the counter was trying her best while the men lingered around, but once we entered the room, all the stress melted away. Clean, modern, calm, serene, and roomy for a big city hotel. Even had a balcony where you could sit in comfort, staring at the grumble and jumble of the town below.
Breakfast was great. Good selection, fresh fruit, good coffee.
Go for a beer on the front terrace and do some people watching. The couches are to die for and the beer ice-cold.
Location: far away from the beach but smack bang in the middle of crazy crazy Legian. Restaurants, Bintang supermarket (a must-see), spa's, clothing stores and much much more within spitting distance.
Beautiful and serene pool-deck to cool down.
We would definitely book again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1471,quick stay,50,September 2015,"we stayed here for just one night as it was all our family flew back and we stayed for an extra night.
the check in was quick and easy. room very nice and clean, nice and modern without losing the Bali touch.
Breakfast: a lot to chose from, full choice from eggs to pancakes/ waffles and rice/ noddles and cakes.
Check was clean and quick, however we were getting picked up for airport transfers letter and would have liked the WIFI to stay available,
no free wifi in front restaurant.
Pool was great with a step so you don't have to put your hole body in if you don't want to.

all in all great hotel, if we find a promo again or can afford it we will stay again,

an other good point is it is walking distance to double six beach bars",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1472,UNACCEPTABLE SWINDLE,10,August 2015,"Unacceptable behaviour from the staff !!!
We booked 2 bedrooms for 2 couples on ebooking (double bed, notified by a message during my booking). When we arrived there, the staff confirmed our reservation of 2 bedrooms, took my credit card imprint, and after that, just said ""by the way, the 2 bedrooms are only with separate beds"".
When we asked for an upgrade or for another solution, 3 solutions were offered to us:
- keeping those 2 bedrooms with separate beds for our last night in Semyniak, especially booked in a fancy hotel
- paying $50 more to be offered a suite with 2 double bed rooms and a living room
- and, I quote, ""or you can cancel and leave""
Adding to that that the upgrading proposition was shown on a beautiful and all prepared book, with all the option (for 20$ more, you can have a that.. for 50$ more, you can have the suite...)
--> All is well prepared, if they saw 2 couples they force you to pay 50$ more to have a suit. 50$ more in Bali is huge and really unacceptable!!!!
We had no choice, took that option (you don't really want to look for a room in semyniak at 4pm with all your luggages...), and 2 hours after, the room was not ready!!!
We also realised that the couple arriving just after us had a room with double bed with no worry.
We also realised that the 2 separate beds could be easily joined together, as it was the case in one of the room of the suite.
When we asked to talk to a french speaking manager, someone mentioned Joan. But right after, we have been respond that ""Joan is no longer working here"".
No commercial gesture has been done.
Wifi was not working AT ALL.
--> Great hotel, GREAT SWINDLING

If that hotel could consider their clients as clients, and not as dupes, that would be a big change.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1473,Evening Meal,20,September 2015,"The place looked inviting from outside, however, the food was very poor and my wife's steak was basically more gristle and fat than actual meat, when asked our thoughts on the meal, which we gave the waitress gave a shrug of the shoulders and walked away. We then had to ask twice for the bill. Cost too much Quality lacking.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1474,Average 3* hotel,30,September 2015,"Internet wasn't great at all, and passwords are changed without us being notified.

Shower over spills water onto the bathroom floor because of the poor design.

Surrounded by very busy streets but located fairly close to the beach.

Breakfast buffet is very reasonable! Staff are really friendly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1475,We'll be back,50,August 2015,"I booked a 1-Bedroom Suite for my daughter (6 yrs) and I, for 3 nights during our trip to Bali. I normally stay at resort style, chain properties, but after reading some reviews decided to book The Haven and I was not disappointed. The suite was huge and had everything we could ever need. Only down point was the shower over bath and with it being so huge, you have to get into the bath to turn everything on, meant I had to get in to sort shower for my daughter as she couldn't regulate the heat. Not sure if they have some rooms with a standard shower as this would be dangerous for older people getting in and out it was a big step into the bath. Otherwise, perfect accommodation. We could get an amazing suite for less than the standard rooms elsewhere. The staff were lovely and very welcoming from the moment we arrived. Nothing was a problem and the service levels were fantastic. Everything right at the hotel door step. Being in a suite there is a back entry for this building, which is also convenient and an easy walk to Double Six Beach, the hotel does run a shuttle a few times a day as well. Breakfast had a good variety and lots of fresh foods. The pool near the suites/villas was rather cool so although my daughter swam I preferred to watch from the lovely double sun lounges. Sabeen restaurant at the front of the hotel is great, we ate here for a lunch & a dinner, and although the prices are high for Bali they were still reasonable considering a hotel restaurant and the standard. The evening we had dinner they had live music, which was a little loud for that time of the night and people trying to talk over dinner. The grounds and overall public areas of the hotel were lovely and clean. I highly recommend The Haven, travelling alone with my daughter I felt safe here and we will be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1476,First class hotel,50,September 2015,"We stayed here for 2 nights and had an excellent stay. The staff were friendly and very helpful. We had breakfast included in our stay which was an outstanding aray of food on offer at that time of day. Although we didn't eat here of an evening the menu did look good!
We had views looking over the pool, which I think all rooms here do. We had good wifi in our rooms too.
The pool was a nice area to chill in the sun. With a few activities on offer during the day.
On our last day we hired a man and car adjacent to the front desk for 500.000 ($50) we had him for the day and he drove us anywhere we wanted to go in and around Ubud. He knew all the places where to take us. Can't recomend this hotel enough.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1477,Memorable Stay,50,August 2015,"This is my 2nd visit to Haven. It's like coming back home.
I stayed 2 nights in suite, 3 nights in villa.

There are few reasons that keep me coming back to this hotel.
First is the strategic location. Just few minutes’ walk to the beautiful seminyak beach, i get to enjoy daily leisure stroll along the beautiful beach watching sunset while soaking in the music and lively atmosphere. When i back to hotel, its offer a quiet and relaxing environment for chilling at the pool or in the spacious room with huge sunbed at balcony. Good sleep throughout my stay. Beside the beach, all the good restaurants highly recommended in trip advisor are either walking distance or a short taxi ride from Haven. A wide selection of local or international spread. My only headache is which one to choose. Convenient stores, laundry services, car rentals, clothing stores are all conveniently located from the front and back entrances

The other reason is excellent staff services. There is always a friendly smile and eager to assist you when you need help. Special mention to Dayu, Made, Marchel for making me feel at home and taking the time to teach me how to use towels to fold into various animals such as Puppy, rabbit, elephant etc. How creative!

Will definitely recommend Haven to friends and looking forward to come back again next year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1478,Great Place to Stay,50,August 2015,"Wonderfull Hotel in Seminyak , nice staff and good service. The food was great . The hotel is very close to the beach, if we need a sunset. Save area to stay. Shopping area nearby and fantastic restaurant from all the country .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1479,Best Hotel in Bali,50,August 2015,The place to stay in the Center of Bali. Comfortable with the best ambience. Good spacious room. Central location with 24 hours nearby mart. Economical at its best. And very helpful staff. And near to every attraction.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1480,value for money.,40,August 2015,"Overall this hotel is good value for money. We paid 794 for 7 nights including airfare , hotel and breakfast. The Breakfast was very amazing and had a huge selection. Only downfall for me was that the hot choc drink was not included in breakfast as i don't drink coffee or tea so i had to pay extra. Also they didn't have hash browns which i thought was a disappointment.
Now onto the room, it was a bit of disappointment when we firsts walked in , however it wasn't bad for the value for money. The bed was not comfortable , and as hard as a brick. Also we kept getting phone calls after each shower to ask us if we were smoking in the room, however the fan in the bathroom was not working which this kept setting off a false alarm. This was a bit of a pain after the 3rd phone call.
The maid service was very good , and they always cleaned the room.
Front end was amazing and always willing to help us and book restaurants for us for dinner.
The Spa and pools were amazing !!! everyone is so friendly at this hotel.
Now onto the location of the hotel, its not much when you first walk in , but this hotel is very central to everything. A 10 min walk to the beach but if you don't feel like walking you can catch the free shuttle bus from the hotel. A 5 min walk to the local supermarket, and a day spa right next door.
Overall, we would definitely come back and stay at this hotel again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1481,Serene,40,August 2015,"Located in Legian-Seminyak area this hotel really a serene sanctuary among a crowded surround. Easy access to everywhere, from Kuta beach to Canggu (if you familiar with south Bali 😊)
Many restaurants and souvenir shops arround. It has two lobby, one is at jalan raya Seminyak and the other is at the back side of the hotel which only 5 minutes walk to the beach.
This hotel is perfect for holiday or bussiness trip despite this is a quite old hotel. Though there is some cracks on the terrazo floor and wall but the staff can do a great maintaining job so they still clean and neat.
But it's kinda hard to connect to the hotel's wifi.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1482,Refreshing pit stop,40,August 2015,"The Haven at Jl Raya Seminyak is top, went to their restaurant at the water site and the service was great as well as the food. It looks great and it's clean and affordable . Wifi works top. It's situated in a busy street with lots of shops, restaurants and near the Bintang supermarket .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1483,One night,30,September 2014,We only stayed for one night as it was on our way to the airport. Good location for where we wanted to go but would not wish to spend my holiday here. The staff was not attentive at all and we sadly felt ignored when we went to the front desk both for the checking and check out.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1484,Nice Bali hotel,40,August 2015,"Nice hotel, good breakfast and attentive staff, clean rooms..... it's on the main Seminyak strip with allot of stores, restaurants, and such....15 min walk to Double 6 beach that passes by many local shops....comes with free wifi but download anything necessary (like maps and travel advisories) before arriving as it is somewhat slow and inconsistent...good value all around",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1485,Good value hotel,40,August 2015,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, asked when booking through booking.com for a quiet room, when I arrived was informed I had been upgraded to a deluxe room 311 at the back of the hotel, thought it was a long walk from the front reception initially but once I familiarised myself with the hotel layout no problems at all. All staff I encountered where very helpful and friendly. Had a little trouble with the safe but this was dealt with efficiently. Room very clean, bed very comfortable. Didn't use either pool but noticed most was in shade. There is a back entrance with small reception and this is the entrance I used for the rest of my stay as it was a short walk out to double six where there are plenty of shops, spas, restaurants etc and short stroll to the beach. Did not book breakfast but plenty of little places to eat near by. Had dinner first night at sateen (front restaurant) reasonably priced, had a couple of cocktails, black pepper prawns and creme brûlée, all were very good, the coffee was also good. There was a 3 piece band on the night with good music and very willing to play requests. Sat near the street as I like to people watch and with the lighting the ambience was great. The staff were very friendly and attentive.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1486,Great stay at great value,40,August 2015,"My husband and I stayed at The Haven on our first visit Seminyak. We were very pleased with the staff who were extremely attentive and welcoming, at all hours. The breakfast (inclusive) offered a good range of both Western and local food options, served buffet style.
The hotel is not the most flash of all the options in Seminyak, but it was well maintained, clean and peaceful - everything you would expect and need from a hotel. The pool area in particular is very nice for lounging during the day, and very pretty at night.
The best part of our stay was the pampering we received at the on site spa, Atma Spa.
The ambiance of the spa is very lovely and private. The girls made us feel very welcome and comfortable. We treated ourselves back-to-back spa evenings because the luxurious service was too good to pass up at very reasonable prices. I highly recommend the Balinese massage and the Ultimate Indulgence package for couples - great for relaxation!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1487,Always a delight,50,June 2015,"Once again we stayed at the Heven,and once again it was a delight.Our room for first week was great,then second week got upgraded to a suite,which as usual was amazing,nothing too much trouble for the staff",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1488,Nice,30,August 2015,"We visited The Haven for tea, the food was quite good & the service was not bad! It wasn't fast but that seems to be a common thing in Bali. My husband tried to order wine from NZ & SA but none available which was disappointing. The toilets were clean.
Other than that not a bad place for a bite to eat.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1489,Very good Hotel in the vibrant area of Seminyak,40,November 2014,The hotel is very well located and i was very happy about it. The staff is kind and they welcomed us in a friendly way. Room was clean and we got upgraded so we had also a living room space. The bathroom was nice but i think that the bath tub is difficult to access for old people: it's very high and you need to be careful. The food is not bad there and there is a nice atmosphere. I loved the bed/sofa on the terrace but difficult to enjoy due to the high temperature and humidity outside.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1490,Great staff.,40,July 2015,"I very much enjoyed my stay at the Haven, we got stuck here after flights got cancelled in July for an extra 8 nights on top of the original 5, and I was very pleased we didn't have to move. The staff are extremely polite and helpful, you find yourself smiling all the time as they are always happy. They're very attentive at breakfast time especially, topping up coffee etc. We also used one of the drivers from the hotel for our outings, Ketut Karmadiarta, who we fell in love with. He looked after us so well, he brought us everywhere we needed at any time of day that suited us, and while he was happy to offer us advice on places to visit, he never put any pressure on us. We learned heaps from him about Bali also, great insider information! If I ever go back I'll be bringing his card with me, I would highly recommend him as would all my friends.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1491,A great place to chill.,50,July 2015,Like many others we were stuck in Bali due to the volcanic ash in July. The Haven was an excellent venue to bide our time- close to everything whilst still providing a sanctuary ( we stayed in the suites at the rear of the property). Staff were great in accommodating a lot of stressed travellers. Restaurant was excellent for dinner and the breakfast was the best hotel breakfast we ate at this trip.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1492,Truly a Haven,50,August 2015,"The definition of "" haven "": place of shelter and safety; refuge; asylum.

Truly applies to this wonderful hotel. We moved here after having our flights cancelled due to the volcanic ash. (Previous accommodation was terrible and wanted a refuge)

The staff are all so very friendly, and although the language barrier is at times a little tricky they certainly make up for it with friendliness. Going out of their way to do anything you may need or want.

It's such a short stoll from the hotel to seminyak beach and 5 minute walk to Bintang supermarket. Close to some great shopping too.

The hotel is separated into 3 sections. Hotel rooms, private villas and suites.

We spent 2 nights in a hotel room and 2 nights in a suite. Both were immaculately clean (and maintained with housekeeping) with spacious showers, plenty of channels on the telly and comfy beds. Although the standard rooms are great I highly recommend upgrading to the suites, which are ah-mazing! They are like mini penthouses. With a full sized fridge, working kitchen, spacious lounge/dining, gorgeous bedrooms and 2 balconies. All for a very reasonable price.

If staying in standard rooms request one away from the reception end as these were quite noisy at night.

There are 2 pools, the back pool is much quieter and shaded from the sun. Front pool has a basket ball ring and pool toys for the kids or kids at heart.

Truly a haven amongst the bustling streets of Seminyak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1493,Bloody sweet mate!,50,August 2015,"LOVES:

I got more than my money's worth. Our sweet was big enough to host a party, it's really cool. Nice staff, very polite and always ready to help, most of them are very proactive. That's why my over all rating is at 5 even if I have dissatisfaction.

SUGGESTION:

1. We got mosquitos in our room, wasn't something that bothered me. I was trying to be understanding that it's because of the plants and contained water surrounding the hotel. I guess, frequent fumigation will help.

2. The tub and the shower was combined, no issue with that but it's so difficult to get in it's seriously high. I'm onLy 29 but it was so painful, I can imagine people in their 50s will say about it.

- keep improving Haven Suite, I'll see you soon. Terima Kasih banyak!

1494,Poor Quality food at a high Price.,30,June 2015,"We enjoyed the afternoon drinks until we got the bill, everything was expensive. We stayed for dinner one night. The food was average to say the least. complained but it fell on deaf ears. I will not eat there ever again. Just to expensive with poor quality food.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1495,Great service,40,September 2014,"Staff so friendly and always helpful.
Food was delicious!
Rooms were always clean and water stocked up.

Hotel close to markets, massages, nail salons and great restaurants!

The pool was great, wouldn't recommend the private beach as it was far and not clean.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

1497,"Good Location and Food for a Good Price, but not a Perfect Haven (3.5 stars)",40,August 2015,"I'm giving this 4 stars mainly on the grounds that for the price and the location, and the surprisingly good breakfast buffet - we paid 4.9m IDR for 6 nights, and the room was pretty decent. It's also in the heart of Jalan Raya Seminyak and a 5 minute walk from the Bintang Shopping Centre (which is pretty awesome). Props also to the breakfast because it's surprisingly good and made every start of the day awesome. And free wifi (which was patchy unfortunately) made this a connected stay.

However, it does suffer from a few issues - we experienced repeated blackouts on the last night of our stay, and a broken air-conditioner on the last morning (which made the room insanely warm). The plumbing was also a little suspect - the toilet bowl had a funky smell which was resolved temporarily but was back with a vengeance soon after. And some of the staff aren't that conversant in English so sometimes communication was hard. But all that notwithstanding, it was a pretty good hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1498,The most grumpy security ever met,30,August 2015,"Dear management - would you please be train your outsourcing security or whatever is he , to be nice to the guests and more respect ? To - every -guests- I meant it , My Tour Guide just got unpleasant treat by one of your backyard lobby security officer , he is so unhappy with that , as well my self ! It is just happening tonight at around 8pm - 9pm . You are in the high level of hospitality so please ensure that things like this will never happen again .

Your team not even standing straight and oversees like normal security on duty (he is Squatting on the ground as a resting position)

Small thing isn't ? But this is almost spoilt our night as we still staying here for a couple days 8-12 aug .

Looking forward for your action

1499,Excellent,50,August 2015,"I had both a pool villa and a suite for my stay and the staff were excellent. The pool villa was great, I will definitely be staying there again.

The hotel was close to everything, supermarket was just down the road and lots of bars and restaurants nearby... The bike hire at the back was great the guy was very nice. Laundry services are close by and great & cheap",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1500,Very nice hotel 5min walk to the beach,50,August 2015,We booked this hotel just for 3 nights and we absolutly loved it the staff is amazing the room was big and very clean there is 2 lovely pools safe in the bedroom only complain will be that the price at the hotel restaurant is very high,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1501,unclean,30,July 2015,"the room #0008 was spacious and had a lovely interior. great location, right near the pool. the hotel itself also in a great spot in the middle of everything.

only my room smelt damp and mouldy. the mirrors weren't clean and had marks all over them. shower didn't feel like it had been cleaned and glass was dirty. i also wasn't able to change the air conditioner temperature and settings and it appeared to be broken.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1502,Loved the breakfast,50,August 2015,"Stayed in a 2 bedroom suite- lots of room and suitable furnishings. Day beds on patio were comfortable. Garden and ponds were well maintained. Kids loved the first pool and the colouring-in that was provided. Breakfast was amazing, great selection and lovely staff. I would stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1503,Fantastic value,50,August 2015,"We were very lucky to find a room at the haven as the accom we had booked across the road was not what had been advertised. We managed to get a room last minute at reception for 5 nights. Good location, v clean, great private lounges at beach, breakfast is amazing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1504,Great location,40,March 2015,"The haven is in an amazing location in Seminyak, close to everything and the supermarket is only a short walk.
Loved how peaceful and beautiful the back pool area was.
There was a few times it was hard to communicate with the staff at reception.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1505,"Great value, awesome breakfast, good location",40,May 2015,"Awesome hotel if you are wanting a clean, safe environment to explore from. We booked two nights in May as part of trip to Bali. We found the staff great, the free breakfast buffet was one of the best we have found in this price range we paid for the room. However, we felt the BBQ night was overpriced and did not deliver but our own fault for expecting a decent steak in Bali. We did arrive a few hours after the buffet had opened so maybe all the good stuff was gone. The band reggae band playing was lovely and sitting in the hotel watching the street traffic go by was lovely. The beers and cocktails were on the higher end of the price scale. We don't come to Bali to sit in our hotel room, or hang around by the hotel pool so this was fine by us. The hotel is in close proximity to both Seminyak and Legian so very easy to pop down the road for dinner. Two convenience stores across the road and a DVD seller if you wanted to stay in one night. Scooters can also be rented from next door. Id definitely recommend the hotel to family and friends, and would love to come back and stay in one of their suites.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1506,Not a 4 star!,30,July 2015,My partner and I arrived here on our honeymoon. we wer cited about the haven but left very disappointed with our stay. At first glance the hotel looks nice- but when you looked al ittle closer (or visited your room) it was obvious that this hotel is pretty run down. The pool is nice but vey noisy with kids playing or people playing basketball (annoying at 7:30 in the morning). We also had an animal in our room one night and felt the staff did NOT deal with it appropriatly (i was asked to help find the animal....). The breakfast is good but that is about all i can say. I would not stay here again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1507,Let down by front desk service,30,July 2015,"Having been to Bali many times and always treated to great customer services wherever staying, it was disappointing to be greeted by such poor customer service on arrival at this hotel. After no sleep as a result of a long flight delay into Bali from the volcanic ash I was looking forward to a prompt check-in, a quick breakfast and grabbing some much needed sleep. Arrived at around 9am with a prepaid 3 night booking that included payment for the previous night as was originally expecting to arrive around midnight.

Was very disappointed to be told that I now only had a two night booking as my room had been reallocated to others due to the ash despite me emailing them as soon as I knew of the flight delay to advise that I would be checking in the following morning. After telling me I could not check in until the usual time of 3pm I pointed out that had I already paid for the room from the previous night and after much discussion the best they could offer was a check-in at 10.30 and an offer to wait in the executive lounge. I can appreciate that the room may have been reallocated, but considering it was paid for there was not even an offer of a refund or did I want to have breakfast (which I had paid for) while I waited or even an offer of a cold drink both of which could easily have been provided without impacting on other guests.

The Lounge was down the rear of the hotel in the suite section and an empty and uninviting room so a very poor first impression of the hotel. Fridge in the lounge was locked so still no option for a drink and no staff in there to help so really felt like I had just been plonked far away from any chance of service. The staff member I eventually found did find did not even know where the toilets were located in that part of the hotel and eventually I found some myself downstairs. Following check-in, the room was nice and clean, staff friendly and helpful so really think it was just a front desk issue on the day. A friend who arrived later in the day experienced a very long and drawn out check-in process so there did seem to be problems. Lots of staff at reception but all seem to just gather around the computer and not know how to process a standard check-in promptly. As they say, the first impression really is important and I am sure if the reception had been different I would have a much better opinion of this hotel to share. Bali was fabulous fun as usual though so this unusual experience of poor customer service in Bali was soon forgotten as all other service during the trip was the usual high standard. Not sure if I would return to this hotel as so many others with much better service around.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1508,Great stay at the Haven,50,July 2015,"My family and I stayed at the Haven from 22-26 July and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel for the price we paid.

Appearing deceivingly small from the street front, the Haven is divided into 3 separate areas with 2 pool areas. Multi storey complex with standard rooms and a pool that gets sun, villas, then another multi storey complex with suites and a shaded pool area.
We had interconnecting rooms in the first complex as we were staying with our 11 and 8 year old. Our rooms on the 1st floor towards the rear of this complex were quiet and had easy access to the pool area. Extremely clean, nice balcony area and a great bathroom. The shower was spacious but note there is no bath tub.
Each room also had a DVD player - great for watching your cheap DVD's and occupying the kids for some quiet time.
Breakfast was included in the rate and was a great spread with plenty of good quality variety.

Upon arrival our rooms were not available as the hotel was at capacity with the airport closure again due to the ash cloud. The service recovery by the staff was outstanding. We were escorted to their club lounge for afternoon tea while we waited for our rooms to be ready. A thoughtful touch which was greatly appreciated.
As in all of Bali the staff were extremely friendly and attentive at all times.
The location is great - a short walk through the rear of the complex and down Jalan Arajuna to the beach. Passing many eateries, shops, massage places and a sports bar. Out the front of the hotel to the left Bintang supermarket is a 5 min stroll away.

We had a very early departure and the hotel kindly supplied us with some complimentary breakfast boxes for our kids. Another great touch.

Worth noting the room service/ pool menu was limited and relatively expensive for Bali standards.

All in all a great stay and I would highly recommend this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1509,worth for money,50,July 2015,"Stayed at both standard room and family suite. Standard room is worth for money, easy access to the pool and main seminyak roads. Family suites are located at the other end of the resort, nearer to beautiful seminyak beach which is only less than 10mins walking distance. Based on my experience, location of stand rooms were bit noisier than suites. Foods at restaurant next to main lobby were great. We ended up eating 3 meals there instead of going out to crowded restaurants in seminyak, as we had impatient 3 kids.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1510,"Overall, The Haven is good for people who are not fussy is not a five star hotel but for the price paid we were offered",40,July 2015,"My partner and I booked The Haven for three nights; we didn't opt for airport transfer and breakfast. Arrived, Bali at 12pm and after haggling price with drivers at the airport, we finally reached The Haven. We carried our own bags and walked to the reception with no staff helping or even acknowledging us. At the reception we waited in line for 20 minutes before they told us our rooms are not ready and check in time was 3pm. Hence we left our bags at the concierge; walked across the street and rented a bike (should cost you 60-70K per day). The Haven is located strategically in Seminyak the hotel is so easy to spot and get around, we topped up the tank (half tank 10K) went to Bintang Supermarket which was a few meters away, spend some time getting our SIM card before making our journey for lunch.

Got back to the hotel and was shown our room by a guy who I believe is a trainee, he was really enthusiastic about his job telling us about the facilities available and teaching us Balinese greetings plus he had a great smile and attitude as compared to the guys checking us in. The suite was great for the price paid, though there is some wear and tear but nothing major. However as we are about to settle in, we realize that air con was leaking badly and spare pillows that were kept in the closets were soaked plus the balcony door couldn't be locked we called room service and within 10 minutes we were ushered to another room at level 4. A guy came and picked us up and soon came along a lady hotel manager? (Apologize for not remembering her name), but she sincerely apologize and promised she will get the issues looked into and showed us our new room. When we step in, she apologized and told us she had prepared a cake and made towel swans and even prepared a flowery bath by herself. Room at 414 was awesome, is located further away from the pools hence is quieter no screaming kids and splashing no loud band music too. Water pressure for the bath is not strong but bearable, weird stench in the toilet so we just kept the lid of the toilet bowl down when not in use. Mosquitoes are everywhere in Bali so
remember to bring repellent. We didn't manage to use the pool as there is so much exploring to be done in Bali.
(Side note):
We were introduced to Antoro by our friends; he has been getting clients thru referrals from Singaporean and Malaysian customers. Have a list of where to go? Name it out and he will plan it out for you, don't know what to do he will suggest you places to go without bringing you places where drivers earn commission. Being a foodie, we had a list of places we wanted to go and try its delicacies Antoro planned the route and brought us there at the same time we even had time to sightsee. He waited for us while we stuffed ourselves full even though we asked he countless of time to join us, he kindly decline. We accidentally lost track of time and we overshot our timing by 3hours, Antoro was nice about it and said is okay and dropped us off at our hotel. The very next day at 10am sharp he was there at our hotel ready to take us for another adventure, he brought us to a beach that only locals know about there isn't any tourist and the waters and sand are not polluted; we spent 3 hours there because it was really so peaceful. He drives a really spacious 7 seater car, with DVD entertainment and if you want to listen to music you can connect it via Bluetooth via his sound system and free wifi on his car. Plus he has a box of water for you, should feel thirsty. We will definitely recommend Antoro to be your tour guide in Bali his services doesn't cost as much as what other driver quoted us before. Help us say Hi to him :)

Overall, The Haven is good for people who are not fussy is not a five star hotel but for the price paid we were offered more than what we can imagine, staff on the ground are courteous. Though I got to admit the rooms need some maintenance, however beds are super comfortable to sleep in. If you happen to stay in Haven try to opt for the Suite as it is bigger and further away from the streets and noisy pools though you have to walk in after a long day out, but for peace and quietness why not",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1511,Staff Friendly,40,July 2015,"We have stayed in this hotel for 5 days and 4 nights.
Excellent staff and the staff attend to our request in less than 15 mins time.
Though the WI-FI was below average and the hotel travel desk charge higher than the outside tour operators.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1512,Utterly disappointing,10,July 2015,"My husband and I booked at the Haven for four nights. As part of our package we were to receive an airport transfer and a free dinner. These they refused to honour. We arrived tired after an airline disruption, due to volcanic ash. We were shown after some time in reception to a very basic room adjacent to the main street of Seminyak. 24 hour noise and no sleep. The bathroom is only divided from the bedroom by a glass screen with a modesty panel. Rooms are small, basic and uninviting. Breakfast is served at cramped tables in a row as you would expect in a hostel,(one morning we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated). The breakfast itself was lovely. There was no real space in the hotel to relax. Both WiFi and cellphone access were marginal, which we don't understand as it was not so at the property next door. The price for this hotel was 150% more than the one next door, where we stayed on our final night and about which none of the above complaints apply. The pool environment was very public and somewhat hard to access. We have been to Bali five times and had this been our initial experience we would never go back. This hotel has an executive area out the back which looks lovely and I think is the apple that is used in publicity to attract ignorant tourists. What we received is far less than I would expect to receive in the Western World for the same price. More like a backpackers.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1513,Okay for 1 time stay only,30,July 2015,"There are so many good reviews about Haven, that it raised up my expectations. But when I experienced it myself, I'd rather other hotel with cheaper one.

Yes, true that the staff is reliable but it should be more. I experienced 30 minutes waiting before I was handled for a walk-in check in (and there was only 1 guest before me).

The room is good & clean. I got to stay at the deluxe one, sited at the back building. It was quiter than the front area. Breakfast is okay. The most stunning one is the pool. As they have 2 pools.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1514,Not a hotel for lolling around,30,July 2015,"Food and cleanliness is first class. Wine prices ludicrous (as with most Bali Hotels).

We changed hotels after a few nights, mainly because there is no casual bar (or pool bar), and the pool was pretty cold as it is in the shade most of the day.

I wouldn't stay there again, prefer more of a resort style hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1515,Stay else where,10,July 2015,"We reserved a queen bed, after traveling 12 hours, they gave us 2 single beds. They told us we had breakfast included when checking in, went to breakfast they told us we didn't have breakfast and than asked us to wait while they sorted it out, they had us waiting at front desk for 20 mins while they were on the phone. We just left and had a nice breakfast else where. Very disorganised and poor customer service. Also house keeping violently and persistently pounded on door at 830am, waking us up to clean room. Our stay was not pleasant or relaxing.Don't stay on ground floor very loud with children and everyone in pool 5 ft from your room. Also if you open blinds they can all see in your room, no privacy. Poor into Internet.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1516,Hidden Gem,50,July 2015,"Stayed at this resort for a family getaway. Liked to location. Its in the Seminyak area and close to shops ans restaurants and still quiet enough for a relaxing time. Rooms were great we stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. Loved the separation between the hotel, suites and villas.
Staff were attentive and pleasant.
Kids loved the pool area. And the beach club is a very nice touch. Private area for the hotel guests at the beach. Perfect.
Nightly themed nights at the restaurant was a nice touch.
In short, its a hidden gem. Great resort.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1517,I like it,50,July 2015,"On the main strip, very well maintained. Clean, rooms big, sheets white and clean with a few free amenities eg: comb, tooth brush/ paste, robes, slippers. Pool is long. Staff were pleasant, wifi good connection. Large TV in room. Only criticism is the lack of sound proofing. The doors to the balcony are not double glazed and all the sounds From the pool, bar, people coming back late and entertainment is heard very clearly. However it seems to go quite around 11-12pm. Breakfast is charge desperate and it is 3x more expensive the the little bars opposite. depends what you want. We feel for Indonisian standards it is very good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1518,Good location,40,July 2015,"Booked Haven for 5 night break was originally in room at front of hotel near reception but after two nights paid for upgrade to suites at rear of hotel as the front was very noisy due to customers coming and going at all hours and the music from restaurant!

Staff very friendly and hotel in good location. Two great 50 mtr pools in nice setting!

Would come back but worth paying extra for suites!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1519,Heaven at The Haven,50,July 2015,We stayed at The Haven at Seminyak for 4 days to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary in Bali. The hotel is way beyond our expectation. It was so beautiful. The staff are so accomodating and attended to all our needs making our stay an enjoyable and memorable one. I highly recommend this hotel.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1520,Loved this place!,50,July 2015,"Absolutely beautiful!! Friendly helpful staff. Nice suite at a good price. Restaurant food was a little expensive but the buffet breakfast was fantastic. Loads of choices, all delicious!! Well maintained pool areas, loved just lying in the sun relaxing. Would stay again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1521,Kept entertained by the flies,20,January 2015,"Just overpriced predominately. Nothing special about the quality of food, drink or service.
Had to continuously try to get the attention of wait staff to place orders, and 4 Coronas cost us aprox 40 AUD.
The place was also over run by flies!! didn't even get it that bad in the Warungs or by the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1522,""" Feels Like Home """,40,July 2015,"We stayed in Deluxe Room, room so good, clean,so elegant, comfortable, good for stay with family, interior / exterior so cool, the food is fresh, so nyummy, if u stay there u feel like home, employee have a good service, feel so secure when stayed in there. For all The Haven Suites all good and I LOVE it",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1523,Excellent accommodation and idyllic retreat,40,July 2015,"Booked two adjoining rooms for my adult family. Rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. The name of the hotel is appropriate (Haven). Breakfast was a good variety, pool and lounges clean and comfortable and only 7 min walk to beach. Hotel also has private lounges on the beach - only for hotel guests. A great touch. Staff were friendly and willing to help or offer advise. Will definitely stay again and happy to recommend to family/friends. Not a 5 star hotel but not far off.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1524,"Positives and negatives, check them out",30,July 2015,"We booked this hotel due to trip adviser reviews, so i always like to put in my review what I would like to know about. We are a family with two children aged 3 and 6 who stayed here for 12 nights in July 2015.

- I will start with the positives
Great location in Seminyak near supermarket (Bingtang) and restaurants, wifi was good most of the time, night times were quiet down near the suites, friendly staff (all greet you as you pass them around the place and made time to speak to my 2 children), clean, comfortable bed, large suite, breakfast has great variety (the chefs making the eggs and pancakes were wonderful, very polite and prompt), great house keeping service!

My child wet the bed sheets on the roll away a bit during a day sleep (oops), so i stripped the bed and called housekeeping to please remake it whilst we went out to dinner, when we returned they had remade that bed and the king bed, done turndown and cleaned the room again! wow that was so nice! They were always respectful when we were in the room during the day and they needed to service the room, they offered to come back at a more convenient time, and were not pushy or put out by it (which has happen to us at many other hotels).

The pool (near the suites) is mostly shaded, which is great for those that do not want to bake their skin and get sun cancer (me), however, it is a bit cold. There is a pool near the hotel rooms that gets more sun and has a small, shallow area for children, which is great. Also there are two pools long enough to swim laps and great lounge chairs all around all pools.

The negatives
The suite has a pretty big kitchnette, however there is no microwave, no toaster, no normal tea like english breakfast, powered milk, no bottle opener, no tea towel/ dishcloth/ dish washing liquid. (Not that i was cooking, but if i wanted to..).

Bathroom: Hot water is very limited, not sure what type of hot water system is used here (please inform me GM if you reply to this review) but hot water is lucky to last 20min and that is being generous, all four of us had to shower in the bath/shower together if we wanted a hot or warm shower! Or one would shower in the night the other in the morning. Our shower head was also blocked when we arrived and spraying water in every direction, so i called reception, and told them about that and the lack of hot water, instantly maintenance came to fix the blockage, but no such luck with the hot water. Also the shower head is a huge round one, however, it is one of those water saving ones that do not wet you, which sucks more when you also have a time limit on hot water. Our shower head was also blocked when we arrived and spraying water in every direction, so i called reception and told them about it and the lack of hot water, instantly maintenance came to fix the blockage, but no such luck with the hot water.

The in-room towels are gross, not sure if they are suppose to be white or cream or what, but they are a lightish brown, frayed at the edges and stained. These would be my outside towels if they were at my house, you know the ones you wash your dog with. The pool towels are a lot nicer. I cannot believe this has not been mentioned in any of the reviews i have read.

The pool areas are not really kid friendly in the sense that there are a lot of sharp corners that could split heads around a slippery pool, i was concerned for my clumsy toddler often.

Breakfast staff are everywhere but there only seemed to be two wait staff that were actually doing anything, the rest stood around chatting to each other, which is fine if there is nothing to do, but diners were often ignored, dirty plates stacked up on tables. We were often sat at tables that were not set, which is fine, however the staff would not go and retrieve the setting and put it on the table instead they continued chatting, i was often running around trying to gather cutlery, napkins and water, which annoyed me greatly, as it is hard enough gathering food for small children. This was not every morning. There was 2 male wait staff who were wonderful and I felt they were carrying the load, I wish i got their names. I think they also have a limited supply of teaspoons, they were not easy to obtain. Also they claim to have FRESH milk, but it is all UHT milk, i could not have tea, coffee or cereal as I cannot drink this type of milk. I did get some fresh milk from the supermarket though.

Also for those with kids, there is no do it yourself laundry, but I did get some washing done at a store behind the hotel, if you go out of the back entrance and go left it is the first shop on the left that sells clothes, it has a laundry sign at the front they charge AUD $2.50 per Kilogram for laundry, clothes came back smelling lovely, took 1 day (take your own scales though, not sure if his were correct).

Also car rental, again exiting the back of the hotel, go left and there is a car rental place with a big shed directly on the right, for a small suzuki Jimny we paid only AUD $12.50 per day, with air con and cd player.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1525,Fabulous location fantastic staff,50,July 2015,My husband son and myself have been staying at The Haven and we have been looked after like a queen and king. This is our 4th time at the hotel and all of the staff are fabulous. Breakfast is good location central to everything and nothing too much trouble. Fortunately we have been upgraded to a suite which is perfect. All we can say is thank you and we will be back in October. Don't miss the Atma spa perfect also.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1526,Love This hotel!,50,October 2014,We stayed in Superior Room but it has a very nice room to stay in Bali. Has a great exterior design and all the rooms have pool view. Near the beach too within 10 mins walking through Arjuna Street (behind the suite). I am having a very nice experience staying in here. The breakfast also delicious. A very recommended hotel to those who has a more budget on hotel in Bali.,The Haven Bali Seminyak

1528,Beyond Expectation,50,June 2015,"We stayed here for 5 days in June 2015. At arrival, the front office section made a mistake by placing us on a twin bed room. We mentioned before that we asked for double bed, for we're on our honeymoon. Then they upgraded us to suite room, which was exceptional. Even the twin bed hotel room was very good, indeed. Their view was very nice. The brekkie was great with vast choice of dishes. The pools were lovely, you could choose between 3 separate pools. You can go to their beach club by shuttle bus for an option. The room rate was very reasonable. The WiFi is extraordinary, the best speed I know so far. I can tell on the same rate of price, this is the best hotel you can get among others in Seminyak.

PS. I stayed weeks before on their sister, The 101 Legian, where my experience was a little bit uncomfortable, but The Haven was impressively beyond expectation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1529,Central location,40,August 2014,This was a good hotel. Spacious modern rooms. The location was central close to beach and shopping. The restaurant served good food. The staff were extremely helpful and good for giving recommendation on tours and local restaurants. Would stay again if returning to Bali.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1530,5 nights stay!,30,July 2015,"I booked just a room, it was good. Actually the bed was quite good, not so hard that I've had other places for 2 months travelling. They try and give the best service, but some of the staff would probably gain alot by entering an English course. Also I think they should have a yoga mat in the gym, I managed to borrow one. And the wifi was really bad in my room and I stayed just one floor above the reception, therefore my grade. The pool is quite cold. Good location.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1531,Good Location and good service,50,March 2015,"We arrived there early in the morning by first flight, so we left our baggages on the concierge and continue to had brunch on the restaurant around the hotel.
The location is strategic and very easy to find taxi to take you anywhere from the hotel.
We got a room on the 2nd floor almost in the corner (we requested not to close to restaurant & lobby) and we could enjoy the calm from our balcony.
The bed is large,comfort and the bathroom is huge.
We loved the breakfast that had lot of variation everyday for western and for Indonesian menu.Sabeen restaurant had a good interior & good service also live music during the weekend.
This hotel is divided by 2 building between the villa and the hotel.
Their spa is located on villa's area so we really enjoy the day when we spent our traditional massage for 60min but really worth it. We stayed for 3 days there and we had one hour free massage on their spa...what a compliment!!
Spending your vacances on The Haven refresh your mind and good memories on it.
I want to come back again to this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1532,Fantastic Value & Great Location,50,June 2015,"Spacious & well appointed clean rooms.
Breakfast was amazing and a huge range of food to suit everyone.
Staff were very friendly, courteous & efficient.
Hotel grounds are imaculatly kept with plenty of shaded areas near the pools etc.
Location is great with plenty of nearby restauants, convenience stores,local traders and transport available.
Nothing was aproblem and we throughly enjoyed our stay.
We definately reccommend staying at The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1533,Best Place to Stay in Seminyak,50,February 2015,"Having abandoned the 'villa' that we had booked for the holiday due to an infestation of mosquitos and rats, the family and I crossed the street to The Haven. What a fabulous place, quiet, clean, modern, magnificent breakfast, great location and not a rat or mosquito to be seen. I will definitely return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1534,Great hotel!,40,June 2015,"Recently stayed in a poolside twin room at The Haven. Great location! So convenient and plenty of places to eat and be massaged really close by! Bintang Supermarket just up the road too.
Rooms were nice and clean, pool was fabulous, staff were really lovely and helpful. And the breakfast buffet... fabulous!
Highly recommend staying at the Haven, will definitely stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1535,"Friendly staff, good location. But rooms need work!",30,June 2015,"We liked how the exterior of the hotel looked. Location was good. Merely 10 minutes walk to the beach and the hotel provides with 2 hourly shuttle service to the beach. Convenience store just beside and across the road, meal options within walking distance and Bintang supermarket 5 mins walk away. Around 10 minutes to Seminyak square, by cab depending on the traffic.

Enjoyed the hospitality. Staff were friendly, sincere and polite, and always ready to help.

Stayed there for 5 nights. Check in was a breeze. The room allocated unfortunately had its air con leaking. They sent someone to check and got it fixed. However, 3 nights in, we heard a loud “thud” in the middle of the night only to realize that part of the ceiling near the air conditioning has fallen and is now supported by a sliding door that’s under it. Requested and had a change of room.

The room was generally spacious and clean. Pillows were comfortable, bedding was fresh and clean, and we appreciated the refill of the mosquito repellent by housekeeping. However, the room was not well maintained. The remote control for the television had masking tape to prevent the batteries from falling off, the wood furnishings were battered and old. Walls were also spotted with stains.

The bathroom felt dirty. There were black spots on the bathroom mirror, and there was mildew on the walls and the vanity top. The bathroom cabinets looked old and dirty. The water pressure from the rain shower was comfortable, however the flooring on the shower area was stained, chipped and cracked.

The sound proofing for the rooms were very bad. We got awakened in the night from the shutting of doors from the other rooms. We could hear all that was going on in the hallway, the pool, and the sewage/plumbing from the toilet.

Breakfast service was okay, but the selection of food choices was quite limited.The food lacked taste and life. Food and coffee could have been better.

Overall, we enjoyed their service but the hotel could do better in up keeping their rooms.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1536,Perfect birthday trip,50,February 2015,"Stayed here for a night post staying in Kuta and Ubud.
Great room and facilities. I slept soundly.
Got the low level room facing the pool. It has also great villas.
Location wise : great. Near to everywhere.
Will come back for sure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1537,cheap and good quality hotel,50,May 2015,"stayed here a month ago and I have to say this hotel is a bargain, the rooms are spacious, the staff are very helpful and the surroundings are just great for exploring on foot...in terms of hotel rate...this hotel is a bargain...the facilities are almost five star level in my opinion...just one thing that was a minor thing for me was the dining area was quite crowded during breakfast time (which is normal in any hotel)...some rearrangements on the buffet and seating I feel is necessary...I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is coming to Bali....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1538,Beautiful surroundings!,50,June 2015,"First of all- staff were so polite and friendly. Never stayed at the haven before but i will most certainly be back! We stayed in the hotel bit- nice big room and bathroom. Love a good buffet breaky! Can have your choice or omelette, scrambled or fried egg or if you have a sweet-tooth- waffles/ pancakes! The haven have 3 pools- with the main 1 being near the lobby( gets most of the sun!) I was also lucky to have my birthday while away- So the staff had organised a mini birthday cake (which was delish!) and sung happy birthday! Loved our week there and will tell fam and friends for sure!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1539,Well.. It's Okay,30,June 2015,"The location is fine even you can hear how load the transportation very busy on the road. Try to get quiet room in the corner. Careful with the bed sheets, you might just noticed that they give you sheets with stains behind the pillows.
Bad smells coming from the drainage.. Dusty sofa in the lobby reception area, and unfortunately the reception and other front liners not welcome with local guests.
Go ahead, it's represent yourself how you see your own country and adoring foreigner you think they deserve better treatment; which is pity because when you are working in hospitality industry, you treat guests the same.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1540,My first time in Bali,50,June 2015,"Before I came to Bali, I researched so many places in Bali, spending close to 2 weeks to do so. I spent so much time on Tripadvisor. Finally, we decided to settle on The Haven Seminyak and what an experience.

Honestly, every single staff we met were so warm.It was my first time to Bali and I totally did not know what to expect. The last 2 years my family of 7 went to Phuket. And yes the service is great.But my experience with the staffs at The Haven Seminyak was better. Everyone was so friendly and so sincere in their greetings.

From my initial correspondance with Eko Yulianto in the beginning of reservation, etc, till the time we check out, it was part of what made my family experience fantastic.The location of The Haven is so fantastic. It is the one that is close to the beach. The only time we took the free shuttle service to the beach was the first day, because it takes only 5-1o minutes(250-300 metres) away from the beach.(My 82 years old father-in-law could comfortable walk to the beach).

I have also walked all the way to Seminyak Square, approximately 25mins walk, which we just have to walk from the main road, Jln Raya Seminyak.I have also walked to Legian Melastri through Legian road. The Haven for me is the best and most central location. It is at the junction between Seminyak and Legian. And so near the beach. It is also the safest place I know, with a beautiful non-noisy area of double six road/beach.

I had a wonderful stay with my family because of a few things.Firstly, the service of the people of The Haven Seminyak.Secondly, the location of The Haven Seminyak(so close to the beach and everything you need is around you for shopping, massage, authorised/ proper money changer, Bintang Super Market). The Spa, Atma is also recommended by my wife, Marie.:) She went there for 3 days.Thirdly, the shopping and food of the area and the beautiful beautiful beach experience.

At first, we checked in on the 16th Jun, 2015 and booked a 2 bedroom suite for 2 nights and followed by a 2 bedroom pool villa for 1 night.On the 1st day we asked to see the 2 bedroom pool villa and was so impressed by the facilities(it has full glass for the upper floor) that we decided to move into the 2 bedroom pool villa the next day.

For those coming to Bali, and want to experience the best location and also the most friendly staffed resort I would recommend the Haven Hotels & Suites. When you go to a big resort, the staff are nice, but the staffs at The Haven are the best I have experienced and the quality of the breakfast I have no complaints during the 3 nights we stayed.

1541,A lovely stay,40,June 2015,"A lovely hotel, with staff that were so friendly and helpful. On site Atma Spa was awesome and we had a treatment daily..Reception staff were very helpful and accommodating. A shuttle buggy service to the beach club every 2 hrs worked well for us. Beach was a 10 min stroll also on days when we wanted to walk. Time beside the pool was relaxing. Yoga and stretching classes were a good start to the day. Cocktails and night caps in the bar area with live music were great evenings. Rooms were air conditioned (with a little smell of mildew, but nothing visible).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1542,Good stop over spot,40,June 2015,"Was really happy staying here. Clean rooms, very nice and helpful staff. Service a little slow, but to be expected. Pool was good. Modern hotel and reasonably priced. The restaurant in the hotel, the Sabeen is super expensive. However the hulk green juice was superb! For something different, Go up the street (north) to grain for a good lunch place. Really nice coffee and fresh food.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1543,Great Modern Hotel,40,July 2014,"Great Modern Hotel, looks small from the outside but stretches back a lot. The rooms are clean and modern, bathrooms are perfect. A free shuttle is provided to take you to double 6 beach. Seminyak is probably the best location for party seeking tourists. Kuta has become a grim place to go. The food needs a little work but the staff and the ambience of the place make it well worth it. Would highly recommend this place.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1544,Amazing accommodation .. But food needs work,40,June 2015,"We stayed 8 days and love love love this place.. We stayed in an one bedroom villa with private pool and it was heaven! Great room.. Great service! Marcel our butler and his team are amazing ... A new ""towel"" animal every day! Room clean and comfortable.. Pool amazing! Location is superb.. Spa is awesome and the girls do a great massage! The only thing that could have been better was the food.. It was ok.. But not Great .. Thanks for having us.. We will be back 😎😎",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1545,Tapas Lunch,30,May 2015,The food came out warm at best. It was tasty enough and the price wasn't too high but it just seemed like it might have been left out in the kitchen all day until somebody asked for it. Average at best,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1546,"Great location, value for money, would stay again",40,June 2015,"The Haven Seminyak is in a great area with lots of shops & massage parlours within the street. We stayed in the one bedroom suite, which is in a separate Wing to the hotel/hotel rooms, and the suites have their own pools & lounge area, own purposes breakfast dining area and own reception area.
The suites are large with a dinning table, full sized fridge & lounge area with a double balcony (ground floor) with day beds.
The room itself has a modern ish Decor but is looking a little tired with marks on the tiles, bench tops & wear & tear in the bathroom but nothing that would detere you from staying here.
The pools for the suites have their
Own sun lounges but the pool area doesn't actually get the sun during the day, so we found ourselves at the hotel pool area.
The breakfast is quite basic & probably needs an improvement. You can still get your eggs & hot & cold items but not a lot of variety compared to other hotels I have stayed at, so we also dined out for breakfast. Overall I would stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1547,Nice hotel with not so expensive price,50,June 2015,The hotel has a very strategic location. Plus this hotel has two lobbies. We can reach double six beach just by walking. The room is really nice and modern and clean. Had a very good night sleep. I really enjoyed the pool. Also they hav bicycle rental. Really nice place to stay. very recommended!,The Haven Bali Seminyak

1550,"""Outstanding Service with Value for money""",40,May 2015,"This Hotel is in a great location and offers range of rooms even suites for families or couples. You will feel very spoilt with access to your own private beach area where staff on on call to assist with your needs from drinks to snack which can be purchased from outside restaurants with no restrictions while sun baking on your beach day bed.
The staff are well trained and very much attuned to their guests ensuring your stay is most enjoyed.
The restaurants will cater for special diets and the kitchen will go out of their way to ensure you are well taken care of :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1551,Convenient location and reasonably priced,40,April 2015,"We stayed at the hotel for 8 days. It was booked by our travel agent and it was conveniently located, whilst our room was quiet.

1552,"Not good value, only good for location",20,May 2015,"Hotel located on the main street of seminyak, with easy access to a lot of shops. convenience store right opposite of the road. The hotel is not well run but charged at premium price. ( we paid >90 per room). we were told rooms are not available when arrived at 4pm. towels not very clean in the room. flies all over the fruits at breakfast. overall, they have the hardware of a good hotel but not enough attention to details from the people.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1553,5-star location!,40,April 2015,"I went here with my family (mom, dad and sister). We stayed for 2 nights. We booked 2 rooms and we got the ones in front of the pool which is pretty neat. The main pros of this hotel is the location cause its in the center of seminyak, so you can easily go anywhere around seminyak, lots of shops and cafes around the area. The breakfast is so-so, can be improved i think. For their overall services, i think the rates of this hotel is quite pricey, but for the location its quite worth it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1554,Not bad for the money.,30,April 2015,"We only stayed here for one night as our other hotel was full (IZE). The location is quite good with a number of shops around and it's always easy to get a taxi. Our room was nice, however, the shower flooded the bathroom quite significantly and the air conditioner in our room leaked. Another issue was that the bathroom has a glass divider and you can literally see the toilet from the bedroom which is really not ok! The buffet breakfast is good for the price with quite a lot to choose from and the pool is inviting. Not a bad hotel for the price but not outstanding either.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1555,A gem in Seminyak,40,May 2015,"We booked this hotel online and when we arrived, they upgraded us to junior suite. I had an enjoyable night there

Pros -
Nice rooms,beautifully decorated and looks new
Pool is large and clean
Wifi is good. No troubles
The location is in the center of Seminyak, but they have a loong complex that you can walk to the double six beach easily through the back lobby.
They give u welcome drink so you can chill in the bar free of charge.

Cons-
Our room is located near the cafe, and there was a band playing that ypu can hear in the room, so our room.is very loud. They stopped the music at 10 pm, though. So if you are an early sleeper, you may ask for a room far from the cafe/bar.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1556,5-star like with friendly budget,40,May 2015,"this hotel amaze me... its not pricy, but the features and ambience looks like 5 star hotel, also friendly staffs... i would recommend this hotel for seminyak area, family or honeymooners to come...
tips for travellers :
1. if you with family ask for suites in the back building, for honeymooners just in the front building area...
2. they have free shuttle and beach club at the seminyak beach... use this for free :)

a comment for hotel :
please separate pork dishes with special area.. its kinda uncomfortable to see pork beacon fried in the same area with egg station...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1557,excellent value for money and very enjoyable stay. Fabulous position,40,April 2015,"We are frequent visitors to Bali and usually bookend our holliday with a hotel close to everything thing and since our old favourite has closed we need a new place. We have stayed before with extended family in the Suites at the back but with just two( mum and myself) we decided to just have a poolside ground floor hotel room. Perfect and inexpensive.
What did impress me was that I think the hotel has improved in every way since our since that visit.Ease of booking response to email and definitely the cuisine. I can remember quite drab breakfasts but not any more.
I commend the introduction to a local fare breakfast by the new food and beverage manager. I love to have Gado Gado and satay or great Pho rather than beans and eggs.
The traditional night was well worth the money and the staff so excited to be part of this night. There isn't another hotel in the area doing this.
All in all the room was good the position to the pool excellent the staff fabulous and what more would you want?
I thin this is the perfect place for new to Bali people.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1558,Beautiful villa,40,February 2015,"The hotel is actually has 3 sections : hotel room, apartment style and villas.

My family and I stayed in the villa, and it was marvelous! Big rooms, very big bathroom with romantic bathtub. They even have two showers, one indoor and one outdoor. And of course private pool.

Sadly breakfast need improvement big time. Minimal choices. But at least staf are friendly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1559,Great central location for couples,50,April 2015,"The Haven really is a great central point for those who want to visit Bali. It is only 15-20 mins drive from the airport and about a $1 - $4 cab ride (make sure the meter is on) from anything else in Kuta, Legian and Seminyak area.

Although there was some construction of a huge hotel near us, we couldn't hear any of it while in our rooms or in the pool. The beach is only a 5 minute walk and all the shopping, bars, supermarket, convenience stores etc. are all right there.

The service from the staff is exceptional. Friendly and always willing to go above and beyond. Although our checkout was at 12pm, our flight wasn't until the evening. They had a special showering and dressing facilities for us so we could be refreshed from our day out before our flight.

Breakfast was awesome as it had the western style brekkie everyday, the Indonesian style was different every day to give a great variety. And I had to get a freshly made pancake everyday. Absolutely delicious. The only thing I can falter, is that the breakfast room is at the front of the hotel, on the busy street so eating your breakfast is accompanied by very loud trucks and motorbikes driving past.

I made use of the fitness facilities everyday, Although small, more than adequate to work off that pancake before hitting the beach.

I would recommend this for couples or families with older children, as it's more suited to them than bringing younger children if you are staying in the rooms, but they do have amazing villas which we asked the staff to give us a tour of and they are spectacular with marble... well everything.

Also the hotel has a great price tag. We were very happy we chose the Haven and would maybe look at getting a Villa there the next time we visited Bali",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1560,"Great hotel, good location and amazing breakfast",40,April 2015,"My husband and I stayed at the Haven for 5 nights in April 2015. We were really happy with the hotel. We stayed in a hotel room which was on the small side but had everything you need - fridge/wifi/balcony. The staff were helpful and courteous at all times. The pool was lovely and refreshing. The location was good as there was a number of restaurants and shops around the hotel and the beach was only 5 minute walk down a side street. I must say I was impressed with the breakfast - they had all the usual offerings plus freshly cooked pancakes, cakes, donuts as well as rotating Indonesian fare - Nasi goring, noodles, soup, sate, spring rolls etc. Pretty impressive spread. Although this hotel has a few scratches and marks as it is a few years old it has everything you need with a relaxed modern vibe. For the price we were very happy. I would definitely recommend and hope to visit again next year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1561,Great Location and Great Staffs!,50,January 2015,The location of the Hotel is great. Walking distance to most of the Beaches. Those who loves shopping would love staying as it is in the middle of a shopping galore. Great restaurant with live music. Hotel staff is very attentive and efficient when attending to your requests. I would highly recommend this hotel. The location is just right.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1562,Very noisy!!,20,May 2015,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the start of May 2015. Never again! We stayed in the front part of the hotel (standard rooms, not the suites), and found them really noisy! The walls are paper thin and you can hear absolutely everything. Even worse, the hotel rooms are all built around the pool which means that you hear everything from the pool area at all times. The hotel also plays music at ridiculously loud levels until 10pm each night. The music itself isn't bad, but you can hear it loud and clear from within your room with all the doors shut which makes it very difficult to sleep/read/watch tv.

There isn't really any Balinese atmosphere either which is disappointing when compared to other hotels nearby. The rooms are clean and nice enough but the clear door to the bathroom with a really badly placed mirror made for some awkward moments!

Location was great

Overall, we didn't enjoy our stay, there are much nicer places nearby for similar prices - we wouldn't go back. However if you aren't bothered by noise you might not mind it here. We also can't comment on the suites and pool at the back of the complex which did seem a bit nicer.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1563,Never again,20,April 2015,"Our criticism of this hotel does not extend to the staff who were always polite, happy and helpful. There does, however, appear to be management and maintenance problems as shown below.
We booked into The Haven for 2 weeks and were shown to our room. We didn’t bother to unpack as there was no room to put our clothes and belongings. Five hundred dollars later we were given Suite 207. There was a dodgy kettle, an inoperative double hotplate and a few infusions to welcome us. No plugs in the bathroom, though one wasn’t necessary in the bath/shower as the water took 5 minutes to run away after a shower. The bathroom door was difficult to close and sometime later, after close examination, the top hinge had been bodged up and was on the point of collapse. As the door was solid wood with a mirror on its rear face, had it fallen it would have crushed anybody in the bathroom.
We were invited, along with others, to a “Meet and Greet” on Monday evening but when we arrived we were told that it had been cancelled. We expressed our displeasure and were treated to a bowl of fruit the following day.
Because of the dangerous door we moved to Suite 305. Still no plugs but no problem with drainage in the bath as the pressure didn’t give enough water to have a decent shower. The towels were always grey, on 2 occasions we had to ask for toilet paper and tissues were measured into refillable boxes. Unfortunately, I broke a pub type wine glass and it was promptly replaced by the housekeeping people.
The walls around the rear pool area are covered with mildew and much of the decking is loose, particularly near the Lemon Cello restaurant.
The last straw came when were in the hotel lobby waiting for our pickup. I had settled the account earlier in the afternoon. Just as we were leaving the Duty Manager came over to me and said, “You had a broken glass in your suite?” I said “Yes, but it was replaced quickly”. He then said “There is a charge of 135,000 Rupiah (about $13.50 AUD) for the glass”. I thought he was joking, but he wasn’t. I paid him in cash, and didn’t bother to get a receipt as our driver had arrived.
Never again!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak

1566,It's okay overall but five class service,40,April 2015,"Room was okay, but it's because I was expecting more. First night the air cond wasn't very cold but they got it fixed after a call. Love that there's a balcony to chill and air clothes.

Pool area was clean and nice but not WOW.. (See pic) I didn't spend much time at the pool, just an evening swim. Towels at no charge.

Breakfast - simple, toast, fruits, sausages, eggs, pancakes, desserts. Had supper at the same place and I have to credit Mr Yasa who is super friendly and nice. The taste wise, wasn't great.

Service: everyone in the hotel greets you, smiley and really helpful! Made me really like Indonesians!

Location - to walk to double six beach it's bout 10 minutes (hotel has a free shuttle every two hours), loved the beach, not overcrowded, though there are some people approaching you to buy their stuffs. If u come across one, try to buy something from them, they are mostly poor and trying to earn a living. You can always bargain! Down the road there are many mini marts, bintang supermarket is 3 minutes walk, made warung is also not far away. To get to seminyak square area is about rp30000-50000 by cab.

Hope it helps!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1567,Lovely Setting,50,January 2015,"Great Hotel.
I originally had a room in the front part of the hotel but opted for the Deluxe rooms at the back.

Sitting close to the water feature its a very pleasant place to sit and watch the traffic go by

Might be worth it for the cold towel :~)",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Breakfast is good. Suggest to have cereal bowls to have breakfast cereal. Only plates were available. More tropical fruits would be ideal to have as well.

Very good service from Mr. Yasa the breakfast waiter. Must thank the gentleman at the front desk ( Could not get his name... ) who helped to receive my package from Jakarta. Please thank him.

Overall it's a very good hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1570,What an experience !!!,30,April 2015,"Stayed 4 days in Haven Seminyak Hotel. Arrived in the evening, greeted by the friendly, polite and efficient staff. It was almost dinner time but the restaurant is empty, dining out maybe a better choice.

The room is relatively small with basic old furniture some areas are rather dusty. A cupboard door in the bathroom has fallen. The bath towels look greyish in colour. Lighting and air conditioning is fine. Plugs are not adequate for modern traveling electric equipment.

One reason, I choose this Hotel because the hotel information said it has self service laundry and shuttle bus service but not true in reality. When I enquired the laundry service the staff told me it is charged as per hotel standard rate, not self serviced. I asked if there is nearby laundry shops they said they don't know of any.

There is a tour desk manned by a few guys claimed to be Hotel taxi driver. One day, I approached them for a ride to Hawaii Art Shop in Pasar Badung. I showed the driver the address in writing, he expressed he understood and we agreed for a fare of 70,000Rp. However, he took me not too far away to Hawaii Art Centre next to Hawaii Hotel, I knew this is not where I wanted to go. He said if I want to go to Pasar Badung he will charge 150,000Rp, that was tricky and unacceptable. Then he admitted he made a mistake and agreed to take me to the right place at no extra charge, but he was in a temper and started to accelerate the speed. For safety reason and not to spoil my day, I offered him 100,000Rp for the trip. Thank God! it was a safe trip not pleasant though.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1571,"Great hotel, fantastic staff and perfect location",50,April 2015,"This hotel is exactly what you want for a stay in bali.

From arrival and check inn we knew this hotel was going to be great just by the way the staff greeted you and helped. We had the pleasure of a few drinks with the manager Joan and head chef Peter, Dayu from customer relations other staff members as we had a long stay they offered free drinks and snacks for a hour around one of the hotels pools. All the members were very friendly and willing to help in anyway possible. As it was my wife's bday they had even arranged a cake and all sang her happy birthday.

During our stay we did the in hotel cooking class. This was a 3 course cooking class and was one of the best thing we all did as a group in bali. It cost us 60 aud pp including free flow cocktails and beers. If you just want to cook it was 30 pp and lasted approx 3 hours. It also came with photos and menus. Would highly recommend this.

The hotel is located near 66 road. You can walk from the back of the hotel to the beach which takes approx 5 mins or get the free shuttle to the beach club. Cocoon beach bar and the bean bag bars are also with in 5 min walk.

Our room was on the bottom floor so we had access to the pool which was perfect as the don't have a pool bar. During the day the staff have music playing and you can order drinks and food if you require. An addition of a pool bar would complete this hotel.

Thanks again to the team at the haven it was a great stay and we will be back again. Special thanks to Joan for looking after my parents and Dayu for your help throughout the 13 days.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1572,Beautiful resort with great staff!,50,April 2015,"Really enjoyed by 4 day stay here...staff were super friendly throughout and the rooms are up to a high standard. Upon arrival we were kindly shown to our room however the air conditioning did not work, we left for dinner and slept the night in the room, however due to it being too hot the Haven staff very kindly upgraded us to a Suite at the back of the hotel. Very nice gesture and the new room was lovely!

Wifi was always good and never had problems with it - the Hotel's beach was also nice but we only went one afternoon there for a short trip but looked nice but slightly far away from the sea.

Breakfast was excellent, with a wide variety of choices - my favourite was the omelette, which you could choice what ingredients you wanted included.

All staff were very friendly and they have a car park at the Suites side of the Hotel so you can park your scooter or car there and not have to walk to the front of the hotel!

Excellent stay and would definitely stay here again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1573,Beautiful place to stay.,40,April 2015,"We stayed for 6 nights of our honey moon in a hotel room. It was nice and clean, the staff were friendly and helpful and the room service and restaurant were delicious.

The spa was amazing! We visited lots during our stay in Seminyak but the Atma Spa at the hotel was definitely the best.

Only negatives were the wifi was really slow and cut out a lot and the construction site next door was very loud way to early in the morning.

The basketball ring in the pool and the high standard of cocktails were our favourite parts of our stay at the Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1574,"Great hotel, great location, lovely staff",40,March 2015,"Lovely small hotel in great location with nice relaxed feel. The staff were very welcoming, always so polite and willing to help with any inquiry. Rooms were spacious, clean and had everything you needed. The extensive buffet breakfast was a welcomed inclusion. I would definitely return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1575,"Great place to stay, nice staff, impressed",50,April 2015,"My hubby and I stayed 2 nights in their villa with private pool. OMG, the overall experience is really great! The Villa is everything, love the pool too, tho I can hear the sounds of playing of the next villa.The staff is nice, we arrived at 5pm so tired, they asked us to have afternoon tea for free then, fantastic!! They offer complimentary pick up from or too airport, great! The driver when we arrived the airport is great, however suddenly a guy helped us to take the 2nd luggage, and we passed to him, afterwards, when the driver asked us to stay as he drive his car come, the guy suddenly asked us for tips, but since we just get there and we dont have smaller notes, he BLACK face to us and said any currency can pay him...we felt a bit embarrassing and disappointed as this isnt our will to do so...then we paid him a higher note but later when driver came, he left...so we thought he isnt the staff of Haven Seminyak...the staff overall inside the hotel is really nice!! Around the hotel got many shops to walk around, breakfast is great too!! Will come back again in future^^",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1576,Home sweet home,50,April 2015,"Since my first stay back in September 2014 I have always returned to the Haven every time had to be in South Bali. Either for business or leisure.

Joan, the GM, and his friendly and dedicated team ensure your expectations are met and more.

Peter, Exec. Chef and F&B mngr, prepare the most amazing breakfast buffet which caters to all. In the evenings guests enjoy their dinner al fresco at Sabeen restaurant, the hotels in house restaurant, whilst being entertaint with live music. The Wednesday buffet is recommended as well as the BBQ night on Fridays.

The rooms are spacious, clean, well maintained. Sleeping at the Haven feels like sleeping on a cloud. There is High Speed Internet WiFi as well as a Business Centre.

The location is just perfect. Walk out of the front of the hotel and you are in the hussle and buzzle of the main shopping street with its boutiques and restaurants, western and local. Walk out of the back and within 5 min you're at Double Six Beach with its beach cafés.

All the other main attractions such as Kudeta, Potato Head, The W, Double Six Rooftop, are within 10 min by scooter. Airport can be reached in 20th.

All in all a perfect hotel. It may be classified as 4 star but the service is more than 5 star luxury and I can tell having worked in London most prestigious hotels for 12 years.

8 months ago I left my home and family in Europe for Bali. I can now honestly say that the Haven Seminal Hotel has become my home from home and the staff my family.

To Joan, Peter, Dayu, Ayu, Agus, and all that I forgot to mention mine and my friends' sincere thank you for looking after me and my friends for the past 8 months.

Yours truly,
Wardoyo",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1577,A Very Beautiful Hotel in Seminyak,40,January 2015,"Love the hotel from the first time I step in.
The view is very beautiful.
The room is quite spacious.
The bed is very comfortable.
The bathroom is quite ""open"".
Wifi & satellite television is great.
They serve pork in their breakfast buffet.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1578,6 day holiday,40,April 2015,"Excellent value. The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious but could do with a little more general maintenance like a bit of painting and fixing... Staff are very friendly, as you would expect from Bali. Good location, close to bars and restaurants and shopping but a little way from the beach... For the price, I would definitely stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1579,Highly Reccomended!!,40,March 2015,"Always love to stay in this hotel!! Perfect location with spacious and clean rooms, The hotel is very attentive to details and offers complete ammenities. Ladies, you do not event bother tobring facial cotton as it is available in the room.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1580,Great breakfast!,40,April 2015,"The Haven is all about location location location! Rooms are clean and well air conditioned. Breakfast is abundant and sure to satisfy the fussiest eaters. The most bizarre experience was losing a toe nail in the basement car park next to 10 employees that were having a break I guess some were having their lunch. Under normal circumstances within the hotel they all can't do enough for you. Yet at this time when they saw I fell off my bike in excruciating pain just about passed out from pain, dripping in perspiration not one person came to ask if they could help or call for some help. I had my 15 yr old son trying to help me up. It was kind of unsettling",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1581,Quiet Weekend Away,40,April 2015,"I stayed at the The Haven at the start of April end of March for 3 Nights, I had booked online thinking that I would get a Studio type room for the Price I paid ($200). I was surprised to find an A 2 room apartment with King Sized Bed, Very nice.

The Hotel ground are very nice and well cared for, with two large pool area's set away from each other. One seemed to be a quieter type pool (with a close kids pool nearby which is only knee deep) and the other for games and events that the hotel holds (water volley Ball etc).

The Staff were excellent and extremely helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble.

This was the second time i had stayed at this hotel, being 6 years in between. Whilst my first visit everything was pretty much brand new, the bathrooms are showing small amounts of age...but it was the sort of thing you noticed only if you really wanted to look for it.

The Hotel is close to many shopping areas and is set away from Kuta so it is a bit quieter but not that far away that if you want to go out it is a simple taxi ride or a long walk (i walked it one day and it wasn't too bad really if you like a bit of exercise).

I would recommend this hotel for a family or couple, I will be staying here again in the future.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1582,Mrs Gaena O'Brien. Perth WA,50,April 2015,"My 2 children and I have just spent the last 9 days in a beautiful spacious 2 bedroom haven suite.
Great location and friendly professional staff that are eager to assist you in any way possible.
The suites have their own tranquil pool and separate breakfast buffet.
We will be returning guests.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1583,Amazing Stay !,50,March 2015,"Nice, clean, large, deluxe double room with flowers on bed & exotic fruits. Excellent breakfast (always fresh and plenty of choice) ! Beautiful SPA, garden, swimming pool ! It was our Honeymoon - Would I stay here again ?? Absolutely !!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1584,"Great Stay,few flaws",40,April 2015,"I stayed in The Haven many times and always had a beautiful time. The rooms are big & clean with everything you need. I stay this time for my birthday, my partner shouted me a spa treatment (50% off spa) which was blissfully Devine ,would recommend it. Also received a delicious little bday cake from staff on my birthday.
Down side - Breakfast has changed at rear location since our previous stays here-seems more chaotic- chefs are cooking on top of you when they use to cook in rear lobby area & dinning area you feel penned in like cattle people asking you to move & dirty plates etc piled up - not a good look. It was a lot better when buffet was in middle of dining area also food more exposed -chicken & prawns sitting out for hours. Staff very accomadating but always had to ask for water, tea, coffee, teaspoons etc.
It would be a wild guess but I'd say there has been a change in the head chef. All in all we still enjoyed our stay again.
Hope this review will help management improve.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1585,Worth the stay,50,February 2015,"I've been calling in here for years after a big morning of shopping and having wonderful lunches and cold drinks & often wondered about staying!
After a work conference and checking out of that hotel early, a friend and I just walked in off the street and booked a room. Exceptionally reasonable rates and a great room, large and modern with a fab bath, separate shower and safe! Great living room with hot drink facilities and small fridge over looking the front pool and backed onto the restaurant and street but heard no street noise at all!
Handy spot, next door to small convenience stores and not far from the big Bintang supermarket.
Staff great, friendly and accomodating! Had a two hour spa service booked up the road but a power cut put paid to that but the haven was on a generator and so was the spa! Thank god for that and we got a two hour spa session with massage, coconut scrub & yogurt (OMG, amazing) rinse and flower petal bath! LOVED IT!
Beautiful gardens and very very clean! Used the middle back pool, nice and quiet and water very cool with a hot day and plenty of shade. My travel friend liked the from pool as it had more sun and water a bit warmer.
Breakfast was included and very very good, fresh and plenty of variety!
Would I stay here again? Absolutely!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1586,1 bedroom villa,20,March 2015,"The Haven is a good hotel, breakfast is good as well. However, I booked the 1 bedroom villa which was not ideal if you want privacy. The villa is in between the 2 hotel buildings and our villa and the pool in our villa were obviously not private at all. Guests staying on the higher floors of the hotel building are able to see right through into our villa from their balcony.

For those who want privacy, please do not book the 1 bedroom villa (am not sure if the other villas are the same though). You may want to check before you confirm your reservation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1587,Very noisy!,30,March 2015,"The staff were all extremely polite the pool is nice however the food is average and the hotel room let way to much outside noise in from the noisy neighbours, traffic,wildlife, and the occasional staff member being moving around furniture ect.

But perhaps I'm being to harsh the room was 70 per night so if your not fussed by the noise book this hotel :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1588,Relaxing & Tranquil,40,March 2015,"I recently had 5 nights at the Haven. We had originally booked 2 rooms and as my sister had stayed here before, she asked (very politely) if there was a chance of an upgrade. We received a suite with kitchen, lounge room & dinning area. The staff were very polite and breakfast was sensational. Just a little word of warning for next time.....don't go when Nyepi Day ""Day of Silence"" is scheduled...access to any beach is prohibited, no pedestrian access on roads, no shops or restaurants are open. It is compulsory (and security will make sure of it) that you stay within the hotel grounds. Dinner at the hotel will close by 6pm & charge US$50p/p. We got 2 minutes noodles from the supermarket the day before. They will disconnect your TV in your room and sticky tape the main light switch off. There are also no flights in or out of Bali. This festival is very important to the Hindu Balinese and one must respect this day...even visitors.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1589,Breakfast yum,40,March 2015,"Good hotel on a busy rd. Pool is nice rooms clean and modern . Breakfast superb , and it's a nice little walk thru the back of the hotel to the beach . It's not your high end hotel but it's clean , and modern. We stayed 4 nights and enjoyed our stay , I would recommend this hotel to my friends .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1590,Too noisy,30,March 2015,"I was staying at this place during my transit time in Bali, waiting for my connecting flight to Jakarta. The hotel was very compact and has a great interior. Lovely bedroom, though. And great toiletries.

However, I couldn't stand with the noise around. I heard so many noise in the middle of the night. Staff was moving furniture (if I was not mistaken), in the middle of the night? I can even hear the footsteps of those people that kept me awake all night.

The breakfast, it was very average. Nothing special. The only thing I love was the fruits. Nothing else. Hope the management will improve the breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1591,Good Hotel,30,June 2014,"I stayed there for 5 days last June. Everything was good about the hotel. The choices in breakfast were very much restrictive, leaving nothing for vegetarians and vegans. The concierge services were expensive. Being a tourist, i felt that i was paying more than the worth.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1592,"Excellent, except...",40,March 2015,"I have just returned from my (5th) visit to Bali & this time, we stayed at The Haven. Location great; staff great; pools great; rooms lovely & clean. But the week ended with a big but! My last night, I had a visitor in my room. A mouse/rat (I couldn't say if it was either, but it was a big mouse if it was a mouse!). The staff came the first time I called with fly spray! I am not sure what they thought they would achieve with that, but it didn't work. The mouse/rat kept coming out to show his/her face. The second time I called, I was moved to another room, which I appreciated immensely. I really can't judge this place on the appearance of a rodent in my room as everything was really great, but it's hard not to... Would I stay there again? Yes...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1593,Not a high end hotel,20,March 2015,"Stayed there for 8 nights this month ... Very disappointed in the service provided from this hotel . Had no aircon working for 3 days/ nights reported it numerous times including 3 am in the morning to get a few numbers pressed on the remote and it was ""fixed"" after asking to speak to manage which a day later they obliged the air con got fixed then the next night it leaked water . They did offer to upgrade to a room at the back of hotel to a pool with no sun and away from friends that where staying in room next door . The decking boards around the pool area and very hot and old and wearing , my foot almost went thru one board walking to the sun bed , which there isn't enough beds or sun for the amount of rooms in this hotel. Stayed in bali 30 days , ended here and it would be the worst place I stayed and the most expensive . Won't stay here again . Needs a lot of maintenance to be a better hotel for it's price .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1594,Well Appointed Suite - Very Good Value,40,January 2015,"Good hotel in the busy resort of Semanyek. Hotel is set on a deep, narrow plot of land. Front of hotel opens on to a busy street, full of lively bars and restaurants so is quite noisy. Room & suites at the back are much more tranquil and close to the pool. Suite was exceptionally roomy and cleaned thoroughly every day. Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1595,As always,50,March 2015,We chose to return to the haven as they have never failed us before and again they have excelled themselves 😊 the rooms are clean well serviced and comortable... The food is excellent and the service as always friendly courteous timely and fun😊 the setting is Central .... Amid the activity but away from the crowd ...,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1596,This hotels never failed me,50,November 2014,"I came here twice. at the first time I stayed in the suite honeymoon room. it was pretty awesome. Luxurious bed and furniture, guest room, kitchen, pool view, plus they put bed in the balcony where you can relax and enjoy sun without leaving your comfy room. Second time I stayed in deluxe room. even though it doesn't have bed in the balcony, its still nice! bath tube and comfy bed. if you go there on your birthday, they will give you nice birthday cake for compliment.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1597,"Hotel grounds are beautiful, staff are very friendly, standard room very average",40,February 2015,If you're staying here opt for a room upgrade ... We paid for a standard room and found it to be just that - standard. On par with the standard room at The Bounty (which is half the price). Having said that though the staff were amazing and very helpful. The breakfast was awesome and the pool was always clean and never packed with people. This was my second stay here and I would stay again just not in the standard room.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1598,"Great room, good value, good location, BUT severely overpriced amenities",40,March 2015,"I had a good deal of around 80 dollars per night for a room here so I couldn't pass up on the opportunity to try this place out.

Found the hotel was great, however I wouldn't recommend utilizing any of its amenities as they are severely overpriced. 120 dollars for express laundry - which didn't come on time, and they dry cleaned underwear instead of washing it (who does that?!). I also don't recommend eating at the restaurant.

The room itself is very good. Modern design, very comfortable bed.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1599,Beautiful,40,March 2015,"This is a beautiful haven in the middle of a busy chaotic street. Right from the busy lane, we entered a place of serenity. The welcome drink was refreshing- tasted like coconut juice with some lime. The room spacious and clean. View from my balcony was some coconut/Palm trees, provided privacy as needed. Breakfast spread was nice. The staffs were helpful and friendly too.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1600,Luxury at a good price,50,August 2014,"We have stayed here twice, first time without children, second with young children. Both occasions, rooms were to a very high standard, staff friendly (more so on second visit) and engaging and eager to improve on their service.

Its central to all that's going on with easy access to taxi's to take you where you want to go.

Selection food good for breakfast, we only ate once in the restaurant for dinner, great selection of other eateries in area to choose from.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1601,In the middle of everything,40,February 2015,"We decided to try something other than beach side. It was handy to be close to everything and you find yourself at the beach while you walk around anyhow. We used the beach shuttle once but it wasn't really necessary. We didn't use their beach side seats, we preferred to sit somewhere that had food and drink service. We had a hotel room but booked at a half price rate. It was a nice room but I wouldn't pay the regular price, you can find much nicer. The breakfast wasn't as good as other places we have stayed at in Bali, despite the higher rate but thats being picky :) The pools are pretty but again much nicer is lesser priced places, its kinda like a pool at home, not resort like. The complex is huge, it takes a while to walk one end to another. We recommend using the lounge on your departure day, its lovely & well air-conditioned. Staff were friendly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1602,Restaurant review only,40,February 2015,"I stayed close by & enjoyed a very nice meal at ""The Haven Restaurant"" recently. Unfortunately the power was off for a while, so it was very hot. The meal was excellent also the staff & the band were to be commended. Meals were a bit pricey but that was expected when we saw the quality of the restaurant.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1603,"Very average, rooms need updating, but good value for money",30,February 2015,"For the equivalent of USD 62 per night, including tax, service, and breakfast, for a standard and good-size room, with balcony and overlooking the pool, this is a good value-for-money place to stay. You’re not going to take your partner here to impress her/him; no way is it a luxury hotel; and the fixtures and fittings have certainly seen better days. But everything’s basically clean and, as is broadly true for all hotels in Bali, the staff are mostly aiming to please and are usually responsive enough. You can’t expect much more for the price.

Bear in mind that if you’re wanting to top up your tan by the pool, you’ll need to time things carefully - most of the day the whole area is in shade. And as the rooms all over-look the pool, which creates a sort-of natural echo-chamber, you just need one group of guests chatting loudly, or larking around in the water, for everything to be heard in your room.

I’ll guess the hotel might be 15 years old, and it seems that nothing much has ever been done in the rooms to upgrade the fixtures. The shower floor is particularly bad (see photo) and there was a real, but not over-powering, smell of (sorry to say) dried vomit every time I stepped inside - maybe the drains? Elsewhere the wood is battered, glass a bit faded, hinges rusting away. The towels are clean, but the white is turning grey, as I suppose they are over-washed and rarely renewed. The booklet of guest information cards about the hotel was more battered and scuffed than a heavily used library book. The aircon in the room worked just about fine, and mosquitos woke me up only twice during my two-night stay. The bed was large and very comfortable.

There seem to be bigger rooms, and separate villas, in a separate piece of land further back from the road. These will no doubt be more expensive, but I don’t know if they’re more updated and modernised.

Buffet breakfast was fine and met my expectations, for the price paid. There’s no air-conditioned space in which to eat, if that matters, and guests smoke anywhere they like. The cooked foods were tasty enough, and I particularly liked the filled doughnuts. Service was fine.

The hotel is in the southern part of the Seminyak area, on quite a busy road, with plenty of restaurants and convenience stores outside or just around the corner. It’s a 15 minute walk to the beach; perhaps 20 or 30 to Seminyak Square. But since taxis are so plentiful and cheap, location doesn’t really matter. Just make sure you don’t fall for the “The meter’s broken” ruse by the driver, and get majorly ripped off.

Overall, good value-for-money, no major complaints at all. I doubt I’d go back, simply because there were no outstanding features of the place, it’s really a bog-standard resort hotel, and there’s so much else to choose from nearby.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1604,Happy Haven,40,February 2015,"When Im stressed at home, I think of The Haven - particularly the oasis at the back of the property. Its often peaceful, relaxing and a happy place for me. We have always been treated with respect from the wonderful staff and management team here. We've been back 7 times now.
I prefer the back of the property (the suites) if you can afford it. I've yet to try the villas, they look beautiful inside. - One day. The new GM has initiated some great changes, so we look forward to enjoying another trip there when we can.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1605,Nice Hotel But Poor Staff,30,February 2015,"In many respects, this is a nice hotel and a very good value. We booked two rooms through Agoda for roughly $65.00 per night per room.

Breakfast was ample and good quality although the waitstaff was poor and slow.

The room was good, clean and large. I only used the outdoor pool which was also very nice if a bit mosquito infested at late afternoon.

My issue with The Haven was staff. When we arrived, the front desk clerk first offered us a $25.00 upgrade for a suite of two rooms/two bathrooms/living room. We declined. (I thought it was a good offer but my wife and companions disagreed)

Then the interaction took a turn south. First, we were told we would need to accept two rooms with two twin beds. Not acceptable for me - so we were the told that we could have a king bed but our room would be street-side and noisy.

We accepted. Now I asked ""what if we book through you for a second night? Can we get the Agoda price?"" Most hotels are happy to cut out the middle man. Not this guy. Dismissive. ""Book it on your own.""

Third and final: my wife is Chinese and has a Chinese MasterCard. We were told it was a debit card and not acceptable for securing the room. False. It's a credit card and the only one we brought with us. After some back and forth he dropped it but said since we had no security they would check the mini-bar! Sure enough, at 9:45 that night housekeeping knocked on the door as my wife was getting ready to shower. I told them to get lost.

The way this all was presented seemed punitive to me for not taking the upgrade. Even if not, it seemed that way. The hotel staff thus left a very negative impression on me from the start and in all honestly, based on every other experience in Bali with staff, I think you can do far better.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1606,One of the greatest hotel in seminyak,40,January 2015,"I stayed at The Haven with my family from Sydney in January 2015. We love the ambiance of the pool area, Its very green, fresh, very Bali! The pool is great (just a little bit cold), but our kids enjoyed the kids pool so much. For the price we paid the room is ok, not amazing but great (need to improve with the toiletries tho' and the bath tub is a bit slippery). I love that they have balcony facing the green and pool. So refreshing.
The breakfast is great. All their staffs are very friendly. The Chef also very nice. I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone else and definitely would stay here again..:)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1607,Thank you,50,February 2015,"Everything has a wow effect, the 1 bedroom suite, huge, breakfast by the pool, what a choice. Take the cooking class, fantastic experience. I can not praise enough of this hotel. Been to Bali many times, but this is by far the best experience. Congrats on the GM & Mgt for such well trained staff. And thank you to the Exe Chef for is attention, very rare you see an Exe Chef with such personality and guest relations. Will be back soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1608,Tranquility haven in Seminyak,50,February 2015,"I stayed in the Haven for 2 nights. We spent our night in junior suites room. The room has a living room, bedroom, bathtub, shower room, toilet, and a spacious balcony. They also provide us with a complete toiletteries such as bath foam, body gel, shampoo, loofah, shaving gel, comb, etc. We really enjoyed the service and hotel environment. This is a perfect hotel to escape from the routines. We also took the 3 hours spa facility in this hotel at ATMA SPA. The hotel location is close to the restaurants, shops and easy to find vehicle rental arround the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1609,Nice Pool-Access Room,40,February 2015,"I like our pool-access room, so comfortable. I can easily jump in to the pool and back to room with ease. Well, quite a view, as well. However, when I first got into the room, the floor felt dusty. I also smell rotten air in the bathroom. I dunno if it's from the water, the moss, or the broken part of washbasin furniture. I also found a used razor on the washbasin furniture. Hope The Haven can also pay more attention to its room cleanliness since you have a lot of time from check-out to check-in time (at 3 PM).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1610,Great oasis in Seminyak,50,February 2015,Second stay at The Haven and some great improvements have been made like cooking classes and more activities. Book in advance at the beautiful spa as they offer significant discounts. The gardens are divine.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1611,Fabulous hotel,50,February 2015,"Just come back from a 5 stay at The Haven. I travelled with 10 ladies. We had originally booked a nearby villa but it turned out not be suitable. We were lucky enough to get some rooms at the Haven. The staff were amazing, so friendly and respectful. I would have happily recommend this hotel. It's close everything.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1612,Great service,40,February 2015,Stayed for a week. Great variety for breakfast. Rooms large enough. Service was exceptional. The cocktail & canapés welcome night was a surprising bonus. Friday's BBQ night was a night to remember with band playing. Overall would stay again,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1613,the haven,40,February 2015,"A group of friends and I stayed in the hotel in the beginning of Feb. We had a really fabulous time there for several reasons:
1. The rooms are comfortable and well air conditioned, the bed was very good (although I could have used some extra cupboards or wardrobes for my clothes)
2. The restaurant serves great food and the service was amazing, the staff literally bend over backwards to make sure you have everything you need. Our meal was slightly delayed on one occasion as the restaurant was busy and the chef manager even came out and gave us a free glass of sparkling wine while we waited! The band were awesome.
3. They have a small but nice beach club which has regular shuttle service (Close to cocoon beach club which is amazing!)
4. All the staff from receptionist, waiters and cleaners were very polite and spoke good English.
5. value for money-considering breakfast (which was a very good mix of Asian and western) is included and the hotel facilities, we are very happy with what we paid.

We will definitely recommend the Haven to our friends",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1614,Outstanding!!!,50,February 2015,"My wife and I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which was spacious and comfortable. The room itself looked slightly worn but nothing a little touch up wouldn't sort out. The hotel is perfectly located in the center of Seminyak which is close to the beach and many restaurants and good night life spots. We want to say thank you to all the staff who were more than happy to go above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome.

One of the highlights of our trip was the breakfast buffet, which was packed with delicious food and a great variety, we have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this was nothing short - in the four times we visited the menu was completely different each time, which was a lovely surprise. The head chef from England would pass through and say good morning to us and make sure we were happy, which was nice. The selection of fresh tropical fruit juices were just perfect, especially the dragon fruit..yum!

Overall we had a really enjoyable stay and will be sure to book in at The Haven on our next trip to Bali. Keep up the good work!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1615,"Super Stay @ Haven, Bali",40,February 2015,We stayed here for 5 nights at the villa and the service was excellent. The staff is extremely prompt and helpful. I'd strongly recommend this property to everyone visiting Bali and plan to stay in Seminyak.....I'd visit this place again.......,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1616,Great location and atmosphere,40,February 2015,"I stayed at the Haven for 3 nights with my partner in a standard double room.
The hotel itself is gorgeous, with a restaurant that looks out on the main street which is great to enjoy a coffee and 'people watch', if you are busy-body like myself.
The perfect location for those want to enjoy convenience but without the crowd of Kuta. Walking distances to endless amount of shops and restaurants and only a $2-5AUD (depending on traffic) tax iride to Kuta centre. This is one of the main reasons why we had chosen to stay at The Haven.
Service was great, as always in Bali. They were friendly and were happy to assist us with anything. We got an early check-in without any extra charges.
The room is quite spacious compared to other generic hotels in Seminyak/Legian that I have stayed in. The room could use a freshen up, felt a little stale and outdated. Bathroom was clean and big enough for my partner and I. Bed was very comfortable and had no issues with mosquitos although this is because they do a 'mosquito spray' within the whole hotel on Thursdays.We also had a balcony with chairs which was nice difference.Walls were very thin, could hear everything that went on in the next room. Did not use the pool during our stay but looked very beautiful and not too busy.
Our breakfasts was included in the rate which we got (yay). Breakfast runs from 7-10 (or something like that) and it was a huge buffet breakfast. We went at different times each morning and it was never too busy to get a spot. Breakfast was amazing! Definitely recommend the breakfast. So many different choices and everything was so fresh. You could even watch them make your pancakes in front of you *drools*.
Besides breakfast, my partner and I did have dinner one time at the Haven. It was the most expensive dinner we had for the duration of our stay in Bali. If you can avoid it, do, as when you step out of the hotel you can find the exact same thing for half the price.
Obviously, most hotels charge more than local restaurants but for portion you got, the price did not match. Very small portion and very average food.
One thing that I did enjoy was that there was live band almost every night and they were very talented too!
Great feel to the hotel, friendly service and spacious rooms.

Would stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1617,Located in the middle of everything,40,December 2014,"My business stays here regularly for business so when I joined him for a holiday, we stayed in a suite. The hotel is situated smack in the middle of the business of seminyak so it's ideal for shopping and restaurants, but not for peace. It's about a 10-15 walk to the beach, though I do not think that Seminyak beach is worthwhile by any stretch, The Haven keeps a nice clean beach front spot. The pool is small, though nice as it doesn't attract too many people at a time. The suites are sizable and well-laid out. All in all, it was a fine stay, but I'd rather be in the quiet parts of Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1618,"Don't waste your money here much better available ..,,",20,February 2015,"Staff were the rudest we have come across in Bali, breakfast did the job but was very average, cleanliness was great apart from the bad sewridge smell in the bathroom. Drinks are very expensive here $20 dollars for a jack Daniels and coke!! Wouldn't stay here again one of the worst hotels we've ever stayed in, best thing was check out time !! Much better options for same money",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1619,Really worth it if you can get a last minute deal,40,January 2015,"This is a really nice resort close to Bintang Supermarket in Seminyak. Nice pools and super warm and welcoming staff (as we say in French, ""avec la main sur le coeur""). Got an unbeatable last minute / discounted rate on Agoda (about USD 70 a night with breakfast, tax and service charge included for a Haven room), and really enjoyed my stay there. I prefer their Haven rooms by far, for three reasons:
1- Excellent location, with direct access to their main front pool if you get a ground floor room (room numbers 0001 to 0012);
2- Not a tub / shower like in suite rooms, but a real, roomy, stand-up shower; and
3- These rooms are much cheaper than their other room categories.
Their breakfast buffet is quite extensive and rather good. I just wish the restaurant staff were a little more alert and provided warmer service and speedier refills in the morning.
Problems with the room (like with the shower in our room on the first day) were addressed almost immediately. Reception staff very kind and efficient. Superb refreshing pools (two main ones) that were really quiet during our stay, with plenty of shade and comfortable loungers.
The only downer is their restaurant: slow service and average food. Plus, their ""welcome drink"" is a joke, an insult actually: a glass of canned orange juice served in their restaurant. Better not offer a welcome drink at all than to serve something that you would never dare offer your own guests. What's the point, really? The other minor disappointment was their internet, which constantly required us to enter our room number and last name. Quite annoying for sure, although the WiFi, just like breakfast, is included in the room rate here, so I cannot really complain. Will be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1620,Outstanding customer service,40,March 2014,"We arrived at 1:00am to welcoming staff who made our check in quick and easy.
The room was small but very clean. The bathroom was one of the best I've seen in Bali. We had a balcony overlooking the pool which was lovely.
The Sabeen restaurant was a lovely spot to it during the day and watch the neighborhood go by. Food was tasty and not too overpriced. (Between $4.00 - $10.00 per item for the lunch menu.)
At night there was often live music in the restaurant area.
Breakfast was included and was a large buffet filled with pastries, omelettes, pancakes, juices and table service for tea and coffee.
The two pools were refreshing and clean.
What really made me love the Haven was the beautiful helpful staff.
I would stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1621,Pretty good!!,40,January 2015,"Stayed at the Haven couple of weeks ago , first time back in Bali for about 4 years and the hotel was very nice! I stayed in a suite which was lovely 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms I slept on the trundle and it wasn't your average trundle bed, it was to me the best bed in the room!! The living room was very nice a comfy couch and 2 arm chairs and a big coffee table! The TV was very good but annoying how there was only one DVD player and that was in one of the rooms not the living room! Stereo is good but you will need to bring an adaptor if you have one of the newer versions of the iPhones! Nice little kitten bathrooms were very nice massive shower and nice bath too! It was quite clean but there are spots where you can see which needs to be cleaned! Location is good some nice places to eat and shop!! We used a great driver called gusty who took us from the airport and we used him as a day trip! Pool was very nice and relaxing , breakfast was always top notch and the staff there are super friendly !!
Not a bad hotel at all!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1622,Sufficient yet unexceptional,30,September 2014,"Situated on the bustling stretch of Jalan Raya Seminyak, this establishment is in an ideal location nestled among an assortment of eateries.

The accommodation itself is adequate enough albeit rather dull and vapid in it's presentation..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1623,Overrated,20,June 2014,"I stayed here as a solo traveller after attending business conference. I stayed at Padma for a four nights, and moved to Haven for another few days. I found it overrated in many ways:

Most staff were unpleasant, and some function at the shower room didn't work properly. Windows got some problem as well. Thin door, so could hear noise from the hallway and outside. Breakfast buffet was quite under expectation. I came in considering it was a 4 star, so it was disappointing to me in many ways.

I can recommend for young solo travelers or young couples, but it is just not for me.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1624,"Great location, great price, awesome chef",40,January 2015,"We spent 7 nights at The Haven and its the third time we have stayed there. The location is great - not beachfront but close enough to the beach and in the middle of all the street action.
First mention needs to go to the Head Chef (or he could be F&B Manager). His name is Peter and has come from the UK. He is outstanding. His food is amazing and he will personally come and greet you and ask about your experience. He isn't ticking a box, he is genuine and impressive. His spaghetti bolognaise and the steaks are superb.... And cheap. ($20 AUD for a sirloin with chips).

The rooms are spacious if you get a one bedroom which I would recommend over the studio. The bathrooms are getting a little tired but fine and not a reason to put you off. Service is attentive but slow from check in to other requests. But we have found that quite normal.

Very easy hotel, clean and certainly a 4 star not 5.... But for the price it is well worth it.

The main criticism is the smoking area. The front of the hotel is open air and elevated above the street which allows for great people watching and to relax with a drink. Unfortunately it is also the smoking area and full of people smoking cigars. It stinks and there is no way you can eat a meal there while they are smoking. They were lighting up at breakfast and it was a complete turn off. It would certainly be the reason we wouldn't stay there again. I'm pretty easy going and have many smoker friends but it was out of control. I think its as the actual owners who took many of the tables with cigarettes permanently in their mouth.

Peter is the reason we would stay there again. He was outstanding.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1625,Great hotel at affordable price,50,January 2015,"My sister and I stayed in a basic room for 11 nights and could not complain about anything. Rooms were cleaned every day, a variety of different options for breakfast were provided and the pool was very nice. I have never seen such friendly staff; you can't walk past one without them stopping to say hello with a friendly smile. The staff were very accomodating of our late flight and offered us a late checkout so that we could relax in our room for abit longer. The location is excellent, not far from anything! Would definitely come back and stay again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1626,"nice hotel, nice breakfast",40,January 2015,"stayed here for 3 nights, and i feel pretty comfortable with the services. i got a room with pool view on the ground floor. it was a nice pool. the room also pretty spacious with nice amenities and comfy bed and pillow. breakfast nice too. they got pretty much choice. overall, we got nice hotel with affordable price. thank you the haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1627,Dirna T,50,November 2014,"The Hotel staff, room and meals were excellent I thoroughly enjoyed my 7 day stay.The driver from the hotel Koko was very helpful as he drive us to exciting places to view. Location was great as beach and shops in walking distance. Bed and pillows very comfortable.Loved relaxing by the pool and enjoyed playing volleyball with other guests. Breakfast what a variety you could not ask for more.Be there or be square.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1628,Surprisingly surprise,40,January 2015,"Sleeping quality is a must whenever I'm travelling somewhere and the Haven Seminyak execute it very good. In my 3D 2N stay I had a good deep deep sleep. I barely cant hear all the noises outside and from all the ongoing constructions around.

With a warmhearted welcome the staff greets us with putting their right hand into their heart and for sure a bright smiles decorate their face. Its already give us a very warm feelings that we might have it at home. There's welcoming drink but to be honest it's ruin the nice feeling because it's so ordinary just an orange juice that even taste not good at all. But I just tell to myself the staff is really friendly and sweet so for sure my stay will be great here.

One we walk to the receiption desk we'll see directly on the right side an L shape of the building and a long square swimming pool with it depth 1,4m. We stay in lower ground room so we have a direct view and direct access to the swimming pool, its a good choice as the swimming pool isn't busy in the time we stay there. It's a nice to have swimming after spend a hot and humid day in Bali's weather.

There are 3 swimming pools, 2 big pools front and back and 1 small pool on the back. I prefer the big front swimming pool, the water is clean and warm and close from the room. The other big swimming pool on the back is more plants around and look more tropical but on the frangipani trees there so many pests that easily blown away by the wind and make the water little bit unclean.

The breakfast is excellent, great müesli collections for the cold breakfast option, plenty of Indonesian menu such as ""Soto Ayam"" etc. The fruits are fresh and mny variety of seasonal fruits.

Service of the staff is really brilliant, they solve our requests to fix the door, change the keycard and

For sure on the next visit we'll stay in here but maybe try the room on the back side.
Goodluck for the Haven Seminyak team :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1629,very relaxing,40,January 2015,"Only stayed 4 nights in a Haven room as part of a package, the room was excellent but the noise from next door could be heard at night. To the hotels credit a staff member attended and told the argueing couple to go to bed. No more problems after that, the breakfasts were top quality and plenty of choice.I enjoyed the pools which had plenty of shade and the staff could have not been more friendly. The beach club was dissapointing as was the beach which was strewn with piles of rubbish and dirty brown water that made swimming impossible. Apart from that I was able to relax on the beach lounges and enjoy some good company.Would definately stay there again. Phil G.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1630,The most expensive Gin & Tonic ever.,30,January 2015,"Spent 7 nights at the Haven last week.Location is spot on as 5 mins up the road is the heart of Seminyak while 5 mins down the road is the heart of Legion.The staff were all excellent and could not do enough for you.Blocked toilet fixed in 10 mins.Bed and pillows extremely comfy.The lounge on offer for late flights is a very good idea.I would rate the room and breakfast a 6 out of 10.The DVD is a useful touch but those who want bathroom privacy will not get it.The villas and the suites if you want to upgrade are a good idea as they are 5 star,and come with a better breakfast.Down in cattle class the same ritual is performed every morning where the non smoking area is full while the two smoking areas are 20 per cent full.Go figure.Not much charm in hotel and a lot of maintainance work to do i.e.Decking ,painting and a bit of colour to gardens.And the most expensive G & T i have ever purchased at 20 dollars with taxes and no oceanview.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1631,Great stay,50,December 2014,"Spent 10 nights in the Haven 1 bedroom suite at the Haven early Dec 2014. Suite was very spacious with 2 balcony areas, it was extremely clean and all the staff were terrific. I do believe that although the hotel is only 5 years old it will soon need some refurb work as there are cracks in the tiles, the kitchen bench and around the bath. I dont think it is lack of maintenance just poor quality materials. It appears there has been some work done by the government to improve the footpaths etc around the Seminyak area which was desperately required. I have not stayed in a Haven hotel room but was able to see into some, for a comfortable relaxing stay pay the little extra and book a suite, you wont regret it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1632,Nice Ambience & Good Location,40,December 2014,"We stayed at The Haven during end of year 2014. We choose one bed room suite, the room is wide and consisting living room plus a dining room (completed with kitchen set). Outside of the room there are still a terrace with seat and a bed to relax. Breakfast very good and delicious, with a lot of variant food. One remarkable thing that we can consume canned drinks & a big bottle mineral water provided free of charge in the refrigerator, it will be refill daily as long your stay (I think this policy maybe different depend your room type).
For me and families stayed in The Haven is unforgettable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1633,Great location,40,January 2015,"Stayed in a basic hotel room at the start of jan. Comfy bed, good bathroom and amenities, good service. Stayed here as my partner had never been to Bali before and thought it was a good central location to give him a good taste of seminyak/legian- which it did. Everything was good, breaky could be jazzed up a bit perhaps with fresh juice, but very minor. Pool was fresh and clean and never busy, Staff were lovely, couldn't ask for much more really. Would stay again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1634,Great stop for cocktails and Tapas...,40,January 2015,"On Seminyak road, this is a place to drop in for a late night cocktail and delicious Tapas. Drinks are beautifully made and service is great, same old thing waiting for the bill. Couple of muso's delivering Jazz on Fri and Sat night is really nice and not overpowering. We have been back to this little 'Haven' three or four times this trip and recommend the visit!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1635,Pleasant stay,40,December 2014,Me and my partner stayed over Xmas period and we enjoyed this hotel. Was extremely quiet for Xmas and during the day there was only a couple of people using the pool which was good. The staff are all so friendly and helpful. One thing I think this place is lacking is a pool bar as u have to walk up a lot of steps to get back to your room or to the hotel restaurant. Location is ok.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1636,Cozy,40,October 2014,"Stay on oct14 for office training.
Room was spacious, brfast was ok, location is also perfect.

Two things that not comfortable are the AC, as it was not too cold on daytime; and the bathroom it looks tired.

Overall, we had great time here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1637,Good for short stay,30,December 2014,"stayed here 4 nights. Location of hotel is oki close to alota tourist shops and many restaurants, bed was comfortable,but the walls are paper thin, you can hear next room showering or coughing. I had no problem sleeping thought, we had no issues, breakfast staff only care to know your room number they look very tired and somehow disappear you end up collecting the dirty plates and emptying the table. Avoid transport staff that stand in corner,I don't know who they work for they have expensive services. I ask them if they can drop me off to the airport by taxi, they said it would cost me 30 AUD, I went to the hotel receptionist booked for metered taxi end up paying less than 7 Australian dollars with meter",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1638,Very enjoyable stay,40,December 2014,"We stayed in 2 bedroom suite over Xmas, really liked the room, hotel, location, staff. Only thing we were not happy with was the room service food was cold by the time it got to us (too far from kitchen?) and walkways a little slippery when wet but otherwise most enjoyable!! Would recommend staying here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1639,Not the best,30,September 2014,This place could be better. If you go insist that your room is ready on arrival. I would pay a little extra and go to paccha or ts suites. It is ok but not the best. It is a good location for shopping,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1640,A Great stay and a Great Location,40,December 2014,"My girlfriend and I stayed here in a suite by the pool and we both agreed it was a nice place to stay and very positive staff. I stayed for 2 weeks my girlfriend 4 weeks. We had no complaints and the management looked after us no matter what we asked for. The location was very handy as we were doing a fare bit of Diving, Adventure scuba Diving Bali is not far away from here and made it easy for pick ups to goto our dive locations. The beach @ Double six is also just down the road and easy to get to. We hired a scooter to do the easy dating around admin stuff you need to do on holidays and to just generally get around and taxis or drivers if we were going to go out for the night.The breakfast is very good here too but make sure you get in earlier rather than later in the mornings. I recommended place to stay for our next trip here and definitely on par with other nice hotels I've stayed at through out South East Asia.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1641,great bolt hole,50,October 2014,The location is great and I love to stay there as it is close to all the lovely shops in Seminyak. The food is not bad too. It is great for friends but also family friendly with a nice pool. Would come back.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1642,Very Good,50,December 2014,"I think this place is very good, for me a good location and great price. I got a deal at $55 per night
plus tax and at that rate I have to rate them excellent because it is amazing value for a good hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1643,Good location,50,December 2014,We so enjoyed to stay for 2 night for our honeymoon. He got discount for the spa for honeymoon couple. Nice and clean room. The staff very friendly and helpful. Good beach club at the beach. So thank you very much for good service.,The Haven Bali Seminyak

The staff were always friendly and very helpful and made me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. The hotel is centrally located in Seminyak and has two great pools and a beautiful garden to relax in. Recommend this hotel for travellers of all budgets, with accommodation ranging from hotel room to suites to private villas.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1645,my stay not as pleasant as last time,30,December 2014,"i was there in august i stay in the suite last time they brought me back of the the hotel reception instead of front as the suites are at the back and you do not have to walk all that distance through from the front reception,this time they drop me off at the front of hotel so the long walk to the back after a long flight there was no cold welcome drink no cool wet washer this time,the room black out blinds did not fit the window as they were short they try and fix by using sticky tape onto windows but keep coming off to much light goes into bedroom of the suite,so i wake up around 6.ooam each morning no sleep in,air con still needs to be updated still cracks in marble floor still slippery fell twice in bathroom the last morning i fell up in the air back was bleeding had bad bruising aswell,they had a special deal for massage so we book 90 minutes in spa centre worst massage as we were hot and sweaty because air con was not working in spa centre it broke down fixed it later after our massage,the breakfast not as good as last time only 2 juices to chose from instead of 4 last time,but the worst thing they did was take our key out in our suite because we went to komodo island 3 days we arrive back at 9,30pm and our suite was hot,i ask them why they take key out and they say to conserve power,as i said to them i have paid for that suite and no one had the rite to take key out if i am there or not,i had all lights off ect except aircon,also they never replace mineral water so no water when we arrive back,i found out the owner has 4 hotels,and he has built the new courtyard marriott we stayed in there suite 1 night to check it out very nice suites are smaller and more expensive but very modern full blackout blinds in the whole suite and great aircon,i can now see why he has let the haven hotel run down he has put his money into new hotel only 15 minutes walk from haven,the haven is not 4 star because of age and fittings air con not great and light getting into suite it is getting run down staff are friendly and do try to help but not always can fix,the other things that need improving amongst others is the juices and milk at breakfast is not cold it is room temp warm,they need alot of updating in suites ect i was treated better in august that was only a 10 night stay this time i was there for 19 nights and service was average i receive less this time compared to last time,i think the head chef should check out his owners new hotel the court yard marriott to see how a real buffet breakfast is done,the head cook i think he was australian goes up to everyone ask if everything is alright they are quick to offer more coffee tea and even have icecream at breakfast for the kids amazing ect the haven sometimes you have to ask for tea or coffee sometimes they offer the haven is no longer 4 star i think 3 or 3.5 star hotel because of rooms and food,4 star for the pools and the nice entrance other problem is alot of staff do not understand english the new courtyard marriott they all speak english well sercurity reception resturaunt staff all good english, at the haven my partner is indonesian and they spoke to my partner less than to me as they felt more comfortable with my partner than to try and speak english to me,there are better hotels if you willing to pay a little extra i just hope they will reburbish but i cannot see that happening as the owner is putting more into his new hotel,thankyou DR WAYNE DERBYSHIRE",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1646,Lovely hotel,40,January 2014,"We stayed here in Jan 2013 with our then almost 3 year old. Stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. The room was modern and comfortable. Had a nice balcony that looked over the pool. Buffet breakfast was included and was served by the pool. Thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and selection at breakfast each morning. The staff were lovely. They are great with kids! The location was great. You walk out the front or the back of the hotel and there were plenty of dining options. Although the front of the hotel is on a very busy main road, once you entered the hotel part you couldn't hear a thing and the suites are a lovely walk down the back of the grounds where it is very peaceful. Good value for money, although when searching for accommodation for our return to Bali next year I have noticed the prices seemed to have risen significantly so we have decided to stay elsewhere next visit. Would definitely recommend the hotel though.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1647,Corners well rounded,40,November 2014,"I stayed here after 48 hours of flying and was very pleased with my stay here. My girlfriend and I were upgraded to a suite for no reason and were given a room over looking the pool (there are two btw). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They genuinely care about your stay and your well-being. For example: at The Haven's beach club not only is there a private shuttle to take you to and from but the beach club boys who set up the chairs look out for our stuff and ask if you are being bothered by the beach hawkers. They also let us know when the current was very dangerous and which areas to stay in if we wanted to go swimming. The cold face towels are the best I have experiences, sounds funny I know, but the essential oil they use is a mix of their own that is refreshing and delightful. They give them out to you upon your arrival, at the pool and at the beach. The buffet breakfast has quality and variety. Everything from an egg/omelet and waffle station to Asian with sushi and porridge to Indonesian and even fresh bread and gourmet butters and jams to cereal and fresh fruit. There were a range of families and couples staying there. The location of the hotel is very close to shopping and restaurants. Everything is within walking distance. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone. Very clean, genuine staff and the perfect amount of ritzy but economic. It is truly a Haven!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1648,Best location,50,November 2014,"The Haven is in such a good spot for shopping and restaurants and bars. Everything is on your doorstep. The staff were so friendly, and the pool is amazing. Food is great. The free wifi in the room was a little slow.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1649,Stylish and Smart Hotel,50,November 2014,"This is a lovely hotel, stylish and open-air design of reception, restaurant and Swimming pool areas etc. the rooms and bathrooms are nice with lovely balconies and funky lighting, staff are also friendly and helpful. With easy access to all the best areas - this is Truly a ""Haven"" after a busy day in Bali !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1650,"Really nice hotel, very good location, n room is clean n decent, for a good price!",50,September 2014,"Everything is great! Only 10 mins to Double Six beach. Except wifi a bit slow.
Also, at the end i accidentally left my swimming trunks, underwear n some small stuff. Tried to call them, staff promised to call but never did. I happened to call a few times n had to explain a few times over. At the end, they claimed they never found my swimming trunks. Who would want to keep my underwear n speedo?? Really regret it!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1651,Perfectly Functional,40,November 2014,"Similar things have been said about The Haven so my points of difference would be to;

* Request a room that has a deck that opens out onto the pool, they're numbered 0001-0012. It's in the front block and from our room (0002) we were only 6 steps into the water, bliss! I'd read comments that whilst the front rooms were closer to breakfast etc they were noisier…. we didn't notice this at all.

* You're only a hop skip and a waddle to a delicious Japanese restaurant. Walk out of the Haven, turn left and it's about 150 metres on your left, Ryoshi. It looks average on the outside (hence why we walked past it for the first 4 days) but once inside it's devine and usually pretty packed. Like most things in Bali it's also really well priced, we had 2 bento boxes, with 2 Bintangs and 2 sprites for NZ/AU $37.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1652,Something to keep returning for,50,November 2014,"This is my fifth time staying at The Haven. I always spend my first couple of nights here before heading off elsewhere. There are many reasons to continue coming back.
The service is always amazing and the staff friendly, helpful and pleasant.
Good breakfast that caters for the way I like eggs. Seasonable fruit, breads, cereals & pastries.
3 pools to choose from. I am happy to spend the day just enjoying the pools. The poolside food is great despite the small portions.
Great spa & when promotions are on reasonably priced. I indulged in a coconut scrub & flower bath following. A really beautiful experience.
If you are able I recommend staying in the suites. The rooms are spacious and clean with modern decor (shower but no baths).
The location is the quieter part of Seminyak, however the beach is 5 min walk around the corner.
Shops and eating places are nearby, although on this trip there were a few empty shops.
I cannot comment on the villas as I have not stayed in these.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1653,"Pleasant, comfortable stay",40,October 2014,"Nice 4-star hotel with clean, comfortable rooms and surroundings with lots of greenery considering it is right in the busy part of Seminyak. Choose the rooms at the back of the property to avoid the noise at the front. The deluxe room could do with more lighting. Good value for money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1654,Great but,40,December 2013,"Its a great hotel the room is big and comfort bed, swimming pool is big but hey you must be quite at noon cause its distrub other guest? What? Haha ..
The breakfast really good but the service is a little bit slowly cause i must wait about 1-2 hours cause i book 5 rooms and fhe rooms is far for each room, dont satisfy cause i must argument with the staff first, to get the room next to each room,",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1655,Villa luxury the whole family enjoyed,50,October 2014,"Travelled with wife and two teenagers, stayed in two bedroom Villa which was fantastic. Comfortable beds, beautiful luxurious bathroom facilities and plunge pool that allows you to cool off whenever you like. This hotel is in the perfect location only a 10minute walk at the most for anything you may need. The hotel provide a lot of toiletries but if you are looking for something extra or maybe some snacks and mixers to have by your private pool there is a supermarket just down the road or a convenience store directly across the road. Breakfast offered something for everyone (Gluten Free & Lactose intolerant included), it was certainly a great way to start the day. There is plenty of shopping surrounding the hotel and if you want to venture further their drivers are well priced, friendly and knowledgable. Also an array of restaurants within easy walking distance, that said, we would definitely recommend you stay in and try the Sabeen restaurant on a Friday night for their BBQ where they cook your selected meat/seafood on demand - Delicious! We will definitely be back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1656,Great first time in Bali,40,May 2014,We stayed at The Haven Bali in Seminyak for our wedding anniversary in May 2014. The first night we stayed at the regular hotel room but since it was our anniversary the following day I inquired and luckily one of their villas was still available. It was a great experience having the villa and private pool made our stay more romantic and worthwhile. If it was not our first time in Bali we would not probably have left the villa. I am not sure what the peak season is in Bali but the hotel only had a few guests during our stay so it was really peaceful and quiet.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1657,Great for families,40,August 2014,"I found this place luckily as we booked the holiday only in a week advance and it's busy season. We five stayed in a two bedroom suite, me and my husband and two teenage boys and a baby. The room furnishing is a bit dated, but the service is great, the pool is lovely. You can walk to the beach in 7 mins, but you can take the buggy from the hotel too, it's handy when you have a baby with you or surf boards. The way in and out is a bit zigzag by water, my husband fell once to the pool. Still recommend it for the value of money. Though next time we might stay right in front of the beach as my husband is a bit fussy and enjoys luxury.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1658,Central Hotspot Location,40,November 2013,This 160 room modern style hotel began operations in mid 2009. As an alternative the multitude of villa accommodation in the area The Haven offers regular hotel rooms and suites with just a few private villas. The property is located on the main street in Seminyak though once inside guests are blissfully unaware of the busy street outside. Packages and special discounts are available throughout the year. Great to stop in for a coffee or a bite of lunch at the very least as you wander the boutiques on the Seminyak strip.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1659,Nice & Quiet,40,July 2014,"I stayed at the Haven in July this year and really enjoyed it.

Check in was really quick, and as a friend of mine had already arrived when I got there and was waiting for me at the bar, the staff took my luggage up to my room while I went to the bar.
The room was pleasant, although there was a bit of a mouldy smell. Lovely balcony overlooking the pool. Wifi worked well in the entire hotel, lots of tv stations to choose from if that's what you're into, and the hotel was nice and quiet overall.

Breakfast was good - I had it brought to my room a couple of times. A couple of misunderstandings when using their laundry service, but nothing major. Overall, a pleasant hotel with very friendly employees. I probably wouldn't stay here again, but that is only because I try to avoid staying at the same place twice. Nothing to do with the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1660,We loved it the 2nd time over! AND we will be back again!,50,October 2014,"This hotel is fantastic, right in the middle of Seminyak yet close enough to walk into Legian. Two large pools with plenty of room for soaking up the sun or sitting in the shade.
The buffet breakfast is of outstanding quality, so much choice and everything that we tried was delicious.
The staff were all very friendly, everyone we crossed paths with acknowledged us and were all very friendly.
We liked the addition of staff doing kids activities by the pool to keep them busy.
We loved the suites, they are just beautiful.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1661,small comfy hotel,40,November 2013,"I stayed here sometimes last year for a quick escape. Lovely hotel, comfortable room, great service, the band that playing every night was good and surely did not disturb our evening. it located on a busy (traffic jam) main road. in fact my family will be having an event in Bali sometimes in November and we will put a lot of our guest in The Haven. I hope they have experience during the stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1662,A great place to stay,50,October 2014,"Fantastic place, I have staid in both the standard rooms, and suites, and all are near perfect, very friendly staff, amazing buffet breakfast, and beautiful pool. Everything is on your doorstep. The restaurant at the front is also excellent, all the services you would expect of a 5 star hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1663,Gerät place to stay,40,October 2014,"I booked the Hotel for 3 nights. I am glad that i chose this place.

Its in the heart of City. You can find everything just outside the Hotel. Very lively. Beaches, Restaurants , and night Clubs within 1 km.

Staffs are freindly. I Dont like food because they Dont have indian good.

All the rooms See specious and well decorated. 2 swimming Pool, every evening they have Live music at Dinner.
Just awsome.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1664,Very nice hotel!,40,September 2014,"Great hotel! We stayed here for 5 nights during our honeymoon. We booked a standard room, this room was nice but nothing special. The staff is very friendly en helpfull. The hotel has 2 big pools with loungebeds and they have a small beachclub at the beach, this is about a 10 min walk. The hotel lies in a very busy street but inside the hotel its very quiet. The breakfast buffet is very good. We enjoyed our stay here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1665,Great hotel,50,August 2014,"The Haven was wonderful, it was a little walk away from the beach but the hotel made up for this. The staff were very friendly and the rooms we amazing, very open plan, natural textures and relaxing. I loved that there were 2 pools and the breakfast was fantastic.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1666,Overall a lovely time Yasa is awesome,40,September 2014,"Me n my BF stayed here at the last bit of our trip in Bali ( We go to Bali oftern and normally stay in Villas). The location is perfect really close to shops and the Beach so i would recommended this hotel to anyone going there who doesn't want to use scooters or the hassel of Bali traffic.
Our room was clean and bug free however its loud i had reception calling me in the morning, and could here doors banging down the hall so maybe ask for a quite room.
Faclities are Nice.
We had dinner in the resturant our last night was fantastic we had Yasa as our server and he was amazing!! (I hope he gets reconigised for how good he is at his job) Thank you so much, the food was lovely and so was the live singer all in all a really good stay :) Thank you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1667,Great stay,40,April 2014,"Had a lovely stay at the Haven - spent the last few days in Seminyak relaxing after a exploring the gili islands. Staff were helpful in finding us a room and we just turned up on the spot and they offered us a good deal for two nights.

Food was ok - although prices of Bintangs and alcoholic drinks around the pool were a little expensive - but there is a supermarket across the road.

Overall a good stay - lovely pool area and location is right in the centre of all the shops and restaurants.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1668,Great return visit,50,August 2014,"Have stayed at The Haven 3 times over the last year , last visit being for 3 weeks in August.
We were very fortunate to be upgraded to a Junior Suite for the entire stay , it was very spacious , spotlessly clean , with lovely bed linen and white fluffy towels.
We have found all staff , including front desk , to be helpful , friendly and gracious , with any problems attended to immediately.
There has been a change in senior management , and food and beverage , resulting in a program of positive improvement , and a new variety of dishes at breakfast.
We enjoy the location of The Haven , close to Bintang supermarket , various Restuarants in the vicinity , and the beach a short walk away,
Have no hesitation recommending The Haven and look forward to our return soon.

William and Raewyn Hulse, New Zealand",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1669,Loved our stay at The Haven,50,August 2014,"We had 3 nights at the Haven after a Lombok trip, just to add another Bali experience. What a treat it was staying in the newer part in private villas. Everything was very clean and comfy with ex breakfast and helpful, friendly staff.

Although the pool villas were dearer we thought well worth it as they were very quiet, roomy and private, yet so handy to all the shopping and restaurants and hustle and bustle. Probably the largest private pool we have had, really lovely and peaceful. Intend to return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1670,business trip,40,October 2013,"Nice hotel, clean rooms, good bathroom, nice pool
Breakfast good, nice location near beach and bintang supermarket
I had a good price, but for more than USD 60 (standard room) it is too expensive
Will come back if the rate is low",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1671,Close to main part seminyak,30,September 2014,"Stayed on friends recommendation. Was ok prob wouldnt stay again.bout 10min walk to beach. There is a beach club they have a buggy to get u there hut shuts at 5pm but not really advertised.

We booked 2 rooms with agoda and requested large double beds. We got there mid afternoon and were only able to get single beds that night even though we booked 3 weeks prior. The room we had on first night was better view of the pool our verandah walked straight onto it.

If u book Request a room at the back of the hotel as the band plays till midnight n can be annoying. That area is more for ppl with no kids n bit more quieter n chilled out. Away from main road

Buffet breaky is sensational as is the friday night bbq buffet

The spa is peacful n relaxing very nice for a proper pamper.

God for couple nights if u want to base urself. They also always have deala so keep an eye out",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1672,Cool,40,August 2014,"We stayed here the last 2 times we came to Bali, the last time was just for a night but we got upgraded to a suite down the back which was awesome, would definitely pay the little extra for one of these rooms next time we go, really nice place to stay and great room. The cheaper rooms are just that but still comfortable but very affordable, really enjoyed our stay here and one of the best breakfasts we had in all of Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1673,"Mouse, Leaking Ceiling, No Refund of Money",10,August 2014,"Myself and my husband stayed at the Haven for our honeymoon for 2 weeks. After the first week we found a mouse in our room and the ceiling of the room was leaking water all over our electric safe. We were moved to another room where after the first night the ceiling started leaking again and the room smelled of cigarette smoke. We were moved to another room where we found another mouse and the room was covered in mosquitoes every day and night. We looked around for another hotel but with only a few nights left of our stay everything was too expensive. When we checked in, the Haven took a $200 deposit, on checkout the Haven said that in 10 business days we would receive that deposit back in our bank accounts. We have now been home for a month and have not received our deposit. I have sent numerous emails and have not had a reply, i have also called the hotel and i am still waiting on my deposit refund. I wouldn't recommend this hotel, there are plenty other hotels and resorts in Seminyak that are much nicer and The Haven is not worth the hassle.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1674,Recommended!,40,September 2014,"Spent two nights in The Haven on a business trip this September and had an enjoyable stay.

Hotel staff is friendly, rooms neat and clean, location fairly strategic, which all made me able to focus on what I had to accomplish for work and relax well at night.
A good breakfast is served in the morning, although specifically the coffee can use definite improvement...

Overall: a recommended hotel!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1675,nice hotel,30,August 2014,"i stayed at the haven for 10 nights had a 1 bedroom suite,staff very friendly staff close to everything shops beach, breakfast good,only problems i had was suite marble cracked and permanent stains, it is advertise kitchenette but only 2 got plates and fridge no utilities in between main bedroom and bathroom is see through glass,so if lying in bed you see your partner sitting on the toilet and in the shower so no privacy,also top of bathroom has window that allows sunlight into bedroom same as dining lounge room there is glass and curtains in there not sunblock,so you have light coming into bedroom from all areas,also inroom dining nothing for children no childrens menu and not much to chose from and finishes early very costly for a place that does need upgraded as it is showing alot of age",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1676,Great spa & pool -all you need for a great stay,50,August 2014,"I ended up choosing the Haven because of its convenient location in Seminyak (less than 10mns walk to the beach/ Cocoon Club) and was very happy with my choice. The hotel has a fantastic spa which offers a great choice of spa treatments at very affordable prices. It also has two swimming pools which are kept impeccably clean (as are the bedroons). The rooms are clean and spacious and has écriront everything needed. There is an armada of friendly smiley staff. The only negative is that the restaurant has live music so some parts of the hotel can be quite noisy and the reception is extremely slow (wayyy too slow! )

But this is a very clean modern hotel extremely convenient and well run. I wood highly recommend it!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1677,amazing villa,50,August 2014,"we had the possibility to stay in a villa with private swimming pool. it was an amazing experience given the luxury of all details, outside and inside.
Great location and staff.
take advantage from the great location and fun opportunities",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1678,Quite and private suite in seminyak,50,September 2014,"Our family ussualy stay in this suite for couple of day. Eventhough they seems like a noisy place, coz they got cafe rit in front of the main road, but at the back of this place, they got a nice quite and private suite.

It really match if u like to have a private hotel in the middle of seminyak",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1679,As expected-No real Improvement,20,July 2014,"Returned to the Haven for a 1-night stay at the end of July, with the possibility of a 7 night stay. Stayed there in January, following a suggestion from Family. In the July stay I paid direct, and stayed the 1 night. No change to the hotel. So when onto another hotel for the rest of the stay and had a good stay. There was one aspect of the trip that was positive. The hotel staff at the front desk offered me an earlier check in by about 1:15 hrs! Thanks for this.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1680,Comfortable stay... =),50,January 2014,"The hotel is really located in a good spot... across the street is a convenience store for those picky items you need during your trip. Plus the hotel is within the shopping avenue of Seminyak. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Buffet breakfast is a win for Asian travellers like me. There were some mosquitoes in the place although they provided an electronic mosquito repellant which did the trick. Overall, the stay was fully worth it! =) Thanks!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1681,"Close to everything, lovely staff",40,August 2014,Stayed at the haven for 10 nights. Location is fantastic as you are close to everything. We only used the beach club one day but it's great to have your own area on the beach. Need to get in early though as we noticed that a few people got there early but would wander off for a long lunch etc and leave their gear on the seats so no one else could use them. The staff are fantastic and really helpful.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1682,"Nice Hotel, absolutely back",50,August 2014,"We were stay here for a few days and could feel a great ambiance, nice room and swimming pool, comfy bes and also friendly staff.
Sabeen, the restaurant is the perfect one you should spend from afternoon untill evening, try their Margaritha, it's so good.
Location is strategic just walk along the street.
Overall, I'm so back again to stay there!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1683,Acceptable but not kids friendly or family hotel,30,August 2014,"We stayed at The Haven for 6 nights and it was average stay but served the purpose. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was really good for a small family in terms of furniture, equipment or facilities. However, few things to highlight about the hotel in general:-

1. Bathtub is not safe at all and you might easily have an accident especially if you have kids.
2. Comfort bed and pillows guarantees for you a pleasant sleep.
3. Suite equipped with kitchen facility and good size of fridge. However, they do not have microwaves as part of the kitchen basic facilities.
4. Expect a lot of lizards and ants but they are friendly. However, mosquitoes are really bad so you better have your Off spray with you to be safe.
5. Housekeeping is not bad at all but not the best.
6. They do not have some basic stuff available in-house like electric adapters and they do not offer you a solution like buying it on behalf of you.
7. Pools are nice to look at from the balcony but not getting any sun during the day. Not kids friendly and their kids pool is very poor.
8. The hotel has nothing to offer for kids at all so isn't really ideal for family with kids unless you stay out the hotel all day. Otherwise, kids are very hard to entertain at the hotel itself.
9. They serve pork without separating it or having a special corner for it apart from the rest of food so Muslims can eat without being worried. One night we decided to eat dinner at the hotel and we wanted to try the BBQ night but pork was next to the meat and seafood while the grill was for all which made us conscious and we decided to leave for dinner somewhere else. was
10. WIFI was very weak in the suite and not stable.
11. The hotel location is pretty good and convenient as it is nearby Seminyak Square and Seminyak streets where you can do lots of stuff like dining, shopping or having a drink at one of the bars at night.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1684,I wouldn't call it a 4* hotel!,20,June 2014,"Unfortunately we stayed in one of the hotel rooms for 3 weeks. Bad decision. For start on the arrival day, our driver at the airport - wanted to rip us off, by trying to charge us for the hotel transfer which was already included in our initial payment. Then at the hotel reception just before the check in - we received stinky (!!!) wet towels to refresh our hands... (I'm sure the towels were nice and fresh once, but wet fabrics after several hours start to stink... come on, you don't do that to your guests...). Any way, let's go further, hotel room was OK, but had a funny smell of old furniture/ curtains etc. Cleanliness was also OK, very basic. Breakfast was rather poor, and to be honest it was not a 4* experience!!! (poor quality of bread, unripe fruits everyday, very poor cold platter, horrible coffee and tea, fruit juices = water with sugar and added colour...) What else, swimming pools facilities good. The restaurant ""Limoncello"" at the back of the hotel - TERRIBLE, old food, disgusting! and the prices soo high!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1685,No kid's activities!!!,20,August 2014,"We stayed in 2bedrooms suite for 5 nights, no amenities provided during the whole stay, no washing machine nor microwave in the suite, which is not convenient for family with 2 kids! Swimming pools are small with no attractions for kids, we had to look for a fun city near by the hotel (Lolly pop) to entertain the kids. lost a bag in a public taxi, we checked the camera's records to identify the taxi number but it was useless and not clear at all, staff are helpful. No separate stations for pork in the buffet, which is not convenient for Muslims and we had to eat outside the hotel for that reason!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1686,nice and great location hotel,50,August 2014,"a very cozy hotel with a lot of plants, public area are well organized with a lot of wind breeze and good circulation. The location is great can be access from either seminyak or legian street. Food are good and service is excellent with reasonable hotel rate, even though room are not that big for standard room.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1687,Great hotel,50,August 2014,"Top hotel in Seminyak . We had a 2 bedroom suite which was spacious and comfortable. The pools and gardens are amazing and the staff were all friendly and the buffet breakfast was brilliant. Now this isn't backpackers type prices here , its very up market but if your looking for a top place this is one of the good ones . Its about 15 min walk to the beach although they run a shuttle if you don't want to walk . Nice restaurant on site or plenty of eating places within a few minutes walk. You can easily walk to Legian or Kuta from here even if your fat and 50 like me.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1688,beautiful surroundings,30,August 2014,Hotel is beautiful. Luscious greenery n pool. I payed 90 a night online which was a special. Room was basic. comfy bed. found it weird that the staff came and did house keeping at midnight took the stock from fridge and locked it so we couldn't use fridge at all. Good choice of breakfast buffet. no room service after certain hours.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1689,Worth the $ and good service,50,April 2014,"Had a 4D3N trip there, very good service and pleasant staff. The room was also rather clean and
The pool was also good! Has a private beach area block out for hotel guest and it is located at the heart of the buzzing area in seminyak. Highly recommended!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1690,"Great hotel, friendly staff",50,July 2014,"We stayed here for 3 nights and we really enjoyed it. The service was excellent & the staff were friendly. Special mention must go to the Guess Relation staff Ria for her friendly advise & service.

We loved the location too with all those shops along Jalan Seminyak.

The only complain we have is the internet speed. It was slow & hard to connect. Hope this problem will be addressed for a better experience.

cheers!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1691,We Miss The Suites Already,50,July 2014,"We had a nice stay for 4 days. The 1 bedroom suite is the option to choose. We took the extra bed but since the room is huge then no space problem at all. The breakfast is great. The bacon is crispy and tasty. The location is near to the beach. They provide free shuttle bus to its beach club. All other options of beach access are available. Be careful in your expectation on your first visit since the hotel access is via very small road (we call it as a ""gang"" in Indonesian language).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1692,Upgrades are wonderful,40,July 2014,"Booked via online service, 2 nights with breakfast for AUD198 and was upgraded to a very comfortable I bedroom suite with a kitchen/ lounge/dining and full length balcony with a couple of daybeds. Very nice!!!
Bed is very comfortable with lovely pillows. Shower over bath is difficult to use as you have to climb into the bath to get at the plug and taps are hard to reach unless you are in the bath too.
Mini bar in full size fridge. Be nice to have some long life milk in there with all the rest of the mini bar stuff. Big cups, selection of flavoured teas, but need a plain black tea bag or two.
My normal gripe is the smokers get the best pool side tables.. Breakfast very good and included. French toast and crispy bacon was delicious. 50%off in the spa in your birthday month, so just time for a massage before I check out.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1693,long time check in,40,June 2014,"The location is very nice, on the main street of Seminyak and just a few minutes to beach. Room is cozy, modern, wifi is very good, breakfast also good. The only lack of this hotel is the check in time need sooooo long to wait. We booked 3 rooms, they said we have to wait since the room only ready for 2 only, so we decided to walk around instead of waiting at the lobby. After 3-4 hours we back to get the room key, the receptionist looks confused, like have no idea at all. So I have to explain from the beginning again, and wait again for 30 minutes just to wait for our room key.. But overall, this hotel is very nice.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1694,Perfect as always,40,July 2014,This hotel is a place we return to .... The staff are friendly helpful and nothing is ever too much trouble ... The rooms are clean the service perfect the food delightful ..... The fitness room us always clean and serves our needs ...... A perfect stay again Thankyou,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1695,1 bed suite or nothing,40,August 2013,"My title says it all. To really enjoy The Haven you have to stay in the 1 bedroom suite! They are simply fantastic for the price you pay! The rooms are clean and have everything one could possibly need to have a relaxing time in Bali. The breakfast is adequate although make sure you have mozzie repellant on if besides the pool restaurant. The pools aren't flash and very small with limited loungers to soak up the rays. The ""beach"" section they have is amusing in that it's miles from the actual hotel and is literally a couple of loungers and a shower partitioned off. Overall i stayed there twice in 2013 and loved both times and clearly it's getting noticed because the prices have gone up dramatically!!!!! Think Bali is getting silly with it's prices....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1696,"The Good and The Bad, But Mostly Good!",40,July 2014,"Having stayed just 2 nights at The Haven, Seminyak (for shopping), I was pleasantly surprised after having spent three nights as a private guest in a 5/6 Star international beachfront hotel in Nusa Dua (for pampering). My room was almost spotless (few clumps black hair on floor, water and fingermarks on glass bathroom dividing wall, smudges on wooden framework around glass door), but otherwise, crisp linen and fluffy towels.
Negatives within room - NOISY - noise from swimming pool; audible flushing toilets in adjacent rooms; noisy tiled passageway outside rooms; loud music until late from restaurant.
Negatives in restaurant - tongs dropped on floor were picked up by waiter and just placed back on servery with food; ""tired"", overheated, dried out breakfast food; powdered milk not fresh; not airconditioned; disinterested waitpersons.
Positives - lovely pool; attentive reception and housekeeping staff; very central for shopping, with nice shops close by; helpful security staff at main entrance.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1697,"Very nice hotel, centrally located",40,June 2014,"My family and I stayed in this hotel during June 2014 and we enjoyed the hotel very much. It is on the main road in Seminyak and very well located. It is a very nice hotel and the service is excellent. The hotel is made up of 3 sections, the regular rooms, a number of villas and then the last section is suites. We stayed in 2 rooms in the first section overlooking the pool area. The hotel could be noisy especially due the pool, the restaurant has live music at night.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1698,Close to where the actions are...,40,July 2014,"The hotel is located in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, but it is surprisingly quiet once you're inside your room.

My friend and I stayed at the standard room. It was spacious and clean. Service was also good, the staffs were very helpful. Breakfast was ok, consists of local fares, bread and pastries, salads, fruits, cereals, pancakes and egg station. However, after two days, I'd rather find different varieties of breakfast in the cafes or restaurants around the hotel.

The Haven has a spot in Double Six beach, Seminyak. There is a shuttle to transport guests to the beach, or you can walk. However, do not expect a beach club as it claims. There were about eight foldable beach chairs placed on the beach side and the spot was marked by the hotel's flags.

There are plenty of cafes, restaurants, shops and boutiques in the area. It's also very easy to find a taxi in front of the hotel. Jalan Laksmana, the other busy side of Seminyak, is also very close, only 10 minutes with a cab. So, if you're looking for a place close to where the actions are, the Haven is the place to stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1699,"Lovely staff, pool does not get much sun",40,July 2014,"Absolutely fantastic staff, always asked how we are/good morning/good afternoon etc. The pools were nice although the buildings are built up around the pool areas so they did not get much sun. The breakfast was also fantastic with a very large variety of food to choose from, including sushi, toast, pancakes, eggs, donuts and the list goes on. Was good that the staff came around and poured coffee when empty instead of getting up to do it yourself. Overall a lovely place to stay in a great location. If the pool does not bother you highly recommend staying here!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1700,Pleasant stay in the heart of Seminyak,50,July 2014,"I've stayed in the Haven for one night with my friends and I got a great room with a direct access to the swimming pool in LG floor. The room was clean and designed well, cozy enough with a good deal of price. Very near to shops / boutiques in Seminyak area, near to Bintang supermarket, and lots of good restaurants nearby. The Haven Hotel is definitely the hotel that you need to place on your priority list for Bali hoilday.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1701,"""Service with a Smile""",40,July 2014,"There are many great Hotels in Bali and believe me I've stayed in many, The one thing that I've found with"" The Haven"" is that its always obvious that the management engage very good with the staff and you see the staff SHINE through with good behaviours delivery great service.

Because I've stayed there a good number of times the Staff always treat me like its my First Visit at the resort and this shows that the training is working to ensure all guest are always looked after:) After booking a number of times with different web sites ,Its best and you only will get a GREAT DEAL booking direct with great rewards ,check for your self!!!!!

Give ""The Haven"" ago and you will not be let down -from great Rooms to Yummy food and Fab cocktails .PS all rooms are great

The staff member who works on the beach on Saturdays is very pleasant and will go the extra mile so you don't need to dehydrate or go hungry",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1702,Feedback,30,July 2014,"I stayed at The Haven for 4 days 3 nights. Service staff was overall nice and friendly. The hotel needs to improve and upgrade its facility.

1. The room that was allocated to us (twin bed) was tidy, but one could sense that the room was left unoccupied for some time due a strong odour that existed in the room. All rooms should have been properly disinfected before any guest arrived since it was peak season at bali.
2. A musty odour emitted from the toilet.
3. Poor toilet ventilation as such, after using, the smell diffused into the room despite us having flushed the toilet bowl several times.
4. Bath tub had some mould around it. The shower curtain was not pristine and clean. It was turning colour.
5. The room needed refurbishment.
6. I wish the toilet doors were opaque and a bit more sound proof.
7. AC was not working well.

Overall, the experience was alright. Room for improvement.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1703,The haven is perfect!,50,July 2014,"I was staying here with my friend from Perth. We were so happy to stay here. My friend arrived there earlier than me. When I was checking in, I gave my ID card to the receptionist, she handled nicely.

The atmosphere in there was so beautiful. It is like a Heaven! If you are in reception area, when you see the downstair, it looks like only pool landscape. But..when you pass through there, to the way to your room, it was so peaceful and clean..quiet!

The room was so nice... clean..and Roomboy cleaned our room so perfect. the smell was good!

The breakfast was excellent.. all the staff is nice, always smile and helpful. The food was great and many choices! it looks so small but actually many choices, even the fruit. And everyday some of food is always changed. I would recommend you that if you ar not in high season, better you offer the guest for any kinds of coffee and tea. I am pretty sure that the guest will feel so spoiled! As..The others hotel do.

My favourite is Sabeen restaurant! because the atmosphere was so nice..we had blissful day! just need to be improved for one staff, she served us with no smile. Sorry to say that. but the man, looks like older than her, looks so very nice.

My surprised about the best staff is..there was a lady. If I know her names, I would mention her names. When we were checking out, we stay at 5**, we were confused to go to lobby, because if we go to the lobby in the front, we have to step the stairs and so hard top bring our luiggage.

but...that lady offered us to bring our luggage and we say ""No..thank you"" and..she said..you can go on this way please..because we have another check out area at the back. It was so easy..and simple but so helpful! she is wonderful...we never know that The Haven has another front desk at the back area.

My another friend from Perth ever been here also with his girlfriend..and still perfect! .

I would recommend you also about the GYM. It will be better if you open for 24hrs. so the guest can go there whenever they need.

I will recommend this Hotel to my friend as I am Hotelier, so I know how to handle the guest goodly.

Thank you..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1704,perfect holidays,50,December 2013,"large suite, very nice outdoor swimming pool, nice buffet breakfast, bar/restaurant with live music, near local activity, shops, beach. good spa. need to improve service and facility on the beach. stay there 3 nights before Christmas, sunny and relax.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1705,Unexpected Luxury,40,July 2014,"We booked a 2 bedroom suite, which on arrival was a very good size for a family of 4. Yes, it was showing a little wear and tear but excellent value for money.
On our next morning we decided to check out the 2 bedroom villla at this resort. This was gorgeous, but note if you have smaller children it would not be suitable as the second bedroom is down alot of stairs and you have to access from outside. The interior was beautiful and spacious and totally luxurious.
We were very happy with this villa and would def. stay again, however I do need to point out a couple of areas where it could be improved.
Considering the Villa is costing a significant amount more per night, the extras were not there.
For example, no welcome basket of fruit or anything. The breakfast could be set up for you in the villa but this was terrible. They basically came with 3 pieces of toast (there was 4 of us) one slice was not cooked and it was all cold. Canned fruit juice, no fruit,cereal, or yogurt and 4 danishes. We also has 4 cups of coffee. The butler even seemed embarrassed about it and suggested we just eat the buffet, which was fine.
The lighting in the bathroom was a nightmare, this could be easily fixed by putting in one of those magnifying mirrors with a light attached, so you could shave or put makeup on. It was very very dark.
Overall very impressed and will go back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1706,Best Hotel,50,May 2014,"We stayed at this hotel for a week in May and it is definitely one of my favourite places we stayed in Bali. The room was beautiful, clean, spacious and had a lovely view of the city and pool. The staff was always welcoming and willing to answer any questions. The complimentary breakfasts and the restaurant itself had great food at fair prices, by the end of the week the morning waitress had our table ready for us when we came which was a lovely extra touch. The pool is nice and the grounds of the hotel are covered with plants which gives it a very serene vibe. I got a little bit of a scolding for signing out my own beach towel (oops, I didn't know I couldn't sign them out myself, the sign out sheet was out in the open... I mean at least I signed it out.... if I didn't bring it back they could have just charged me...) but other than that there were no issues. They offer a nice little beach lounge area where you can also get towels and have access to lounge chairs (since the hotel is not directly on the beach). It's a great location, close to a credible money changer, 2 streets away from the Bintang supermarket, and close to many restaurants and shopping areas. Overall, it is a very nice hotel. :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1707,Recommended.,50,January 2014,I have stayed at The Haven on five occasions in either a one or two bedroom suites. Both come with a fully equipped living room that compliments the luxurious bedrooms. All rooms have access to extensive balconies overlooking the central garden and pool area. The swimming pools in the Suites area are well shaded and very refreshing. The staff are friendly and very helpful and always greet you with a smile.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1708,Great hotel but not so great staff,40,February 2014,"Stayed at family room in early 2014 with 3 other friends. Both bedrooms were spacious, one of the room came with a bath tub, the other one came with shower. Good bathroom amenities and clean towels. The breakfast and room service were good too. One thing that made me put 4 point instead 5 is one of the staff when I arrived. He was wearing hotel uniform and looked like he is area supervisor or something because later on that day I saw him passing the back lobby near breakfast area. On my way down to motor parking area down the Sabeen restaurant, this guy stopped me and asked questions like room number and those standard questions, which was fine if he asked it nicely, but he didn't. He seemed very unwelcoming at all, maybe because he didn't believe that he talked to one of his own guest. Finally after convinced him that I was a guest, he left. Later on when I met him near breakfast area (now clearly noticing that I was a guest) he was acting real polite and apologetic. Made me think that management should remind all staff to treat every guest equally (whether they are coming with motorbike, taxi or a fancy car, no matter what their nationality is) and be nice to people (whether they are guest or not). The rest of the staffs were friendly and welcoming.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1709,Great Location,40,June 2014,"We booked a 2 bedroom suite, which consisted of a huge master bedroom with spa, a large and very spacious lounge room and kitchen and another room with twin beds and large bathroom. The balcony was very small but did have a nice bed outside which you could sit and read. Very strange, the kitchen facilities catered for 2 people yet it was a 2 bedroom suite for 4 persons. Could not fault the cleanliness of the rooms or the resort everything was perfect. We were disappointed we were on the 3rd floor and were quite a distance to the pool but that is the fault of the travel agent not the hotel.
The breakfast was amazing, possibly the best breakfast I've had anywhere. The pancakes are a must. The location is perfect, walking distance to everything, Bintang Supermarket is a 3 minute walk, heaps of great restaurants nearby. Could not fault the hotel. I would recommend it but you can get better value accommodation elsewhere which also includes a pool but don't let this last comment stop you from staying we absolutely love the hotel and the staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1710,Nice stay,40,August 2013,"We stayed in 2BR suite. Spacious livingroom, clean kitchen, nice bedrooms. Nice and clean swimmingpool. Quiet. Breakfast had no many selections. Overall enjoyed staying there. Will stay there next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1711,Good Hotel,30,June 2014,"Stayed at The Haven late June this year. We had booked two twin bed rooms with a common living room in between for four people. On arrival were given one twin bed room, a living room and a double bed room. As two of the ladies did not wish to share a double bed they were given another room four rooms away from ours which really split up the group. As we had paid for a suite so we could all be together, we were NOT IMPRESSED! Otherwise, the hotel was clean, well appointed, staff were friendly, nice pool, happy hour every day for guests, breakfast good.
The noise factor at times was a problem as we had a large gathering of people in the flat above us partying in the room and on the balcony till about 2 am for two of our six night stay. The staff stopped the noise only after a phone call to reception. Meals at the front restaurant of the hotel we found a bit expensive for what you got! Nice spa for treatments! The aircon needed servicing as it was either boiling hot or freezing and looked ancient.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1712,what a great hotel,50,March 2014,"nice room clean and nice staff
i enjoy everynight to see live perfomance band in this hotel
so far this is a good hotel i ever stayed in seminyak

this is not to crowded as jalan dyana pura
and yes i will go back to stay in this hotel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1713,THE BEST HOLIDAY FOR MY FAMILY,50,September 2013,"Haven is the best place ever because of the quality of the rooms. The hot tubs were really good as you don't normally see these in hotels. The entertainment was amazing and my step dad loved the Karaoke! The food is delicious, the best I've had in a hotel.The arcade was really good but very busy. Maybe having 2 arcades would be better. It was the best holiday ever. I didn't go in the spa.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1714,Very nice hotel & fabulous breakfast!,40,June 2014,"We spent one night here & I would certainly recommend this place to anyone. Very clean rooms & very friendly & professional staff. Good clean pools & nice outdoor areas. Breakfast is great with something to please everyone. Not really traditional Balinese though - if u want more upmarket, western style then you would be happy here. All up a nice place...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1715,Be careful with your room selection and you'll have a great time.,40,June 2014,"Three great things about the Haven:
- the spa. It's fantastic. The price is more than a local shop but the quality of the massage is top-notch, it's clean/beautiful/quiet and the staff are very professional.
- the rooms in the back unit. Quiet, clean, peaceful. Modern design - decent free wifi.
- the staff - everyone tries very hard and is quite attentive. Phone calls were returned quickly, every staff member greeted you when they passed you, nothing was too much trouble. Security guards are quick to get you a cab/help you cross the street.

Three things to know:
- the rooms in the front unit are loud. Paper-thin walls. I could hear the guest in the next room getting up for a pee in the middle of the night.
- there are two pools - neither get a great amount of sun at this time of the year. The one that gets the most sun has very limited deck chairs, often filled by 8 a.m.
- there's a beach club! there's a club lounge! there's a whole other part of the hotel that I didn't know about until the second day. Staff could be a little more forthcoming with information (beach shuttle, second dining room for breakfast,etc)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1716,Great hotel,40,June 2014,"My husband and I stayed at the the Haven for 8 days. We were really happy with the "" special"" deal we got! Price was great ! Breakfast fabulous! Staff just lovely.we got an Upgrade,at a small cost. We were happy as it was in a quiet area.
Probably could do with a little extra loving! Bathroom tiles cracked.,but over all room was very comfortable.poor lighting in rooms.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1717,only the location.....,30,June 2014,"great location, and it stays at that. with a bit more of management involvement they can raise their 60th position to 30th. but looks like no one was bothered never met the management team...!!

stayed 1 week, the reception said that they do not accept international debit cards.. with which i have had no problems traveling the last 6 yrs, in south africa, japan, singapore, thailand, vietnam and india. so we had to pay cash for all services like laundry, dining, drinks etc. so we chose to eat out.

the room needs maintenance and so does the public areas, looks like no one has been caring for the last 1yr.

food, nothing great to write home about, two of their restaurants did not serve balinese food, which was a let down. even the nasi goreng and mid goreng was not good.. surprising.
bfast was very very average, bali being a tropical country the abundance of fruits are visible in the local markets, but the fruits at the bfast buffet stayed at pineapple, watermelon, papaya and honey dew melon....every day for one week.. !!!

thank god, met a local who suggested us some excellent local restaurants which saved our experience of balinese food.

we booked through agoda and got a great flash deal, hence the average rating. otherwise we would have given it poor.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1718,Nothing to fault.,40,May 2014,"After staying at a traditional Balinese complex type establishment for a week we moved onto The Haven for a few days. We couldn't find fault.... except maybe that a splash of alcohol would've been more than welcome in the 'welcome drink'. ;-)
Location is good if you want to fall out of the hotel into the hustle and bustle. Although sitting in the bar at the front of the hotel is relaxing and interesting as you can people watch in comfort.
We actually loved the pool areas as they are quiet and relaxing, I can understand that it wasn't really an environment that enticed children (although there were a few quietly swimming) but we wanted to relax so it was excellent for us.
The breakfast was average, no fault, nothing to rave about, tasty. The staff brought us the same drinks that we ordered the day before without prompting ... Nice touch.
The staff were actually excellent all round.
The room was on the second floor above the pool, near to reception. It was modern, clean, light and very comfortable. Nothing run down about it at all.
We also found it quite sound proof so make sure you ask reception for a refurbished room as from other reviews it seems that some are not modernised.
I would go back to this hotel and I would recommend it to friends.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1719,Excellent,50,April 2014,Feels like Heaven. We stay in family suite on the second floor and the second building. The room is cozy and very comfortable. My daughter very excited play in Swimming pool. The staff in Hotel have a good manner. Thanks Mr. Made Adi for your fast response when i stay in The Haven.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1720,Valentine's getaway,40,February 2014,"It was my 2nd time stay.. at first I was stayed at the haven suite on the back of the property, the staff upgrade my room since I came there around 6pm.. it was great! Nice and serene... bfast by the pool..

The 2nd time they placed me in the hotel, the room was quite spacious, and the modern interior had me fall in love.. though I was annoyed by the bathroom cleanliness, not as clean as they were at the suite property. Was it normal? I really can't tell..

I enjoyed the buffet breakfast... Especially when you were able to get the front sofa facing the seminyak street while raining.. and love the muesli! Though I would still suggest the chef to have more variety on the menu..

Easy access to double six beach and shops were just across the street....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1721,Don't bother,10,June 2014,"We stayed in the family suite. It was seriously run down, cracked tiles on the floor, mouldy bathrooms, stains all over the beach tops. The rooms are very dark and lack atmosphere . They are also at the very back of the hotel. The pool area is not child friendly at all. No music or sunlight. After more than 20 trips to Bali and heaps of different hotel stays, this is by far the worst hotel we have stayed at. Not good value at all. Staff kept us waiting and the welcome was disappointing. If you are brining children under the age of 15 don't book this place.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1722,Wonderful stay,40,April 2014,"It's our maiden trip in Bali and we choose this hotel mainly of location. As we booked direct through the hotel, the complimentary one way transfer was much appreciated especially when we landed at almost 7pm in the evening.

Staff was extremely friendly throughout our stay and they never fail to smile at us (even maintenance staffs!) There is also early bird discounts at the spa where you can save substantial amount by booking 2-3 days beforehand. We enjoyed the spa and the price was reasonable.

For the Haven rooms, my only grouse is that the walls are way too thin and we were woken up by rowdy guests next to our room every night. Other than that, we are pleased with the room and the powerful aircon amid the hot weather.

On our last night, we book the 1 bedroom suite with the private pool. We were pleasantly surprised to receive a call from the front desk in the morning to update us that they are preparing the suite for us and once it's ready they will inform us. The suite probably cost 3 times the price of the usual room. We enjoyed the amenities within the villa but it was a pity that the room was way too warm. Even if the air con and fan, i am still perspiring. I hope something can be done to improve this in future.

The hotel is near to a wonderful restaurant - Warung Made. Just cross the road and walk along the traffic for around 200m. :) Also, we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast provided. It was wonderful, especially the freshly made waffles!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1723,Disappointed,20,May 2014,"We found the staff upon arrival great. Upon entering our room the wrong bedding configuration and view was give.
N. We had to wait 36hrs for a room transfer and went from twin share to a queen bed.
We rang room service and no one answers...we could see the restaurant the phone ringing from our balcony - terrible service. The food was low quality. We complained upon departure and the duty manager laughed. We left early and went to stay in nusa dua where luxury is worth it!
We got recommended the haven and will not be returning. There are better value for money places in Bali,",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1724,"Great location, friendly staff",40,September 2013,"Stayed at The Haven twice in 2 years and I must reiterate the awesomeness of its location. Just a stone throw from Beach 66 and a quick taxi ride to most locations in Seminyak and Kuta.

More effort can be put into its maintenance as the hotel has aged quite a bit since my previous visit just one year back. But the great location, spacious rooms and affordable price will be hard to beat around the area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1725,Terrible Stay,30,June 2014,"Upon checking into the hotel the staff at the front desk were extremely unorganized and rude. They tried to take on multiple tasks all at once and neglected us. The staff lacked ettiqute and seemed to treat us differently since we booked through Expedia. We finally were able to check in and they brought us in to our room. The room was OK the pictures on Expedia looked better. The floor had dirty foot prints all over the room and there was so much dust and dirt in the corners are of the room. The staff obviously didn't even bother to clean up the room properly. I wanted to change rooms immediately but the staff told me to wait 5 minutes while they clean the room again. We agreed and waited and watched while someone came in our room and mopped the dirty areas sloppily - he took about 5 seconds to ""clean"" our floors. We let it go and got ready to go out. As we were leaving the hotel I asked the front desk to send someone up to clean the room again as it was really dirty. When we got back the room looked the same and it was clear no one was sent up to clean the room. The shower leaks as well and taking a shower will flood your room. We didn't even bother complaining because we knew the incompetent staff would never do anything to solve our problems. You can defiantly do a lot better for the same price or less. Save yourself from the disappointed and check out other hotels.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1726,Great place in middle of Seminyak,40,May 2014,"Still staying in the Haven, tomorrow is my departure date.
Room performed excellent, The housekeeping team, especially who cleans my room, did his job accordingly, room is superbly cleaned as it supposed to be, and on time, Wijaya is the name.
Front Office very helpful, glitches on the food delivery, but mistake on my side, thanks for the patience. Check in was hassle free, less than a minute, hope this apply for our check out time also.
Restaurant, however, was declined to enter for breakfast for having hotel slipper as my footwear, agreed and understood as it is the hotel policy, however noticed that few of guests who were having breakfast wears hotel slippers, policy seems need to be adhere irrespective type of guest.
Breakfast was indeed great, especially the waffle and the pancake. Service was great too.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1727,Good enough,40,May 2014,Breakfast was very good. Stayed in the main building at the back which was loud. Beach club wasn't very nice with shuttle every 2 hours. Staff was very friendly. Room was very comfortable. Pools were nice. The one in the back very private. Will stay there again,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1728,great stay,50,December 2013,"book a superior room for 3 nights, by the time we got there the officer up graded the room to a one bedroom suite, what a surprise!
overall the room, the service, the food was very satisfying..
it become one of my favourite place to stay in seminyak, bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1729,Average Hotel in Beautiful Bali,30,May 2014,"This hotel is segregated into 3 sections, the hotel, suites, and villa sections. We had stayed in a 2 bedroom suite so be sure you validate what you're booking.

The positives were as follows:
- Suite was very spacious, approximately 1,000 s.f.
- Location of property is convenient if you intend on spending the majority of your time in Seminyak, generally central within shopping, nightlife, dining, and beaches

The negatives were as follows:
- Lack of the wonderful character you would expect from any hotel in Bali
- Craftmenship in hotel finish was mediocre (i.e. 1) our shower door didn't close properly, 2) toilet not fastened to floor securely, 3) mid to low-end finishes on furnishings, 4) horrible shower heads! It was so bad we had to ask for them to fix it)
- Late checkout was a hassle. The latest front desk offered was 1pm, which was bogus given that we travelled during low season and the hotel was clearly not at capacity. We did end up negotiating a 3pm checkout but only after significant effort
- Breakfast is substandard - found a fly in my porridge (croissants are well done though)
- Pool sits in the shade for most of the day, which may be ok for some folks, but not my preference since I prefer to tan

Closing comments are that the hotel is mediocre and characterless, on an island where countless wonderful options exist. We travel to Bali numerous times a year, so am familiar with the quality of options available. The hotel was ""ok"", but we were generally disappointed by what we got and wouldn't recommend this property.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1730,Could be better,30,May 2014,"Have been staying here for 4 nights now, we booked a 2 bedroom suites.
Likes
1. Checkn was pretty breezy
2. Good locations
3. Some of the front desk staffs are really polite and helpful
3. Spacious living room and balcony

Dislikw
1. The toilet bowl is wobble. Not properly fastened to the ground(?)
2. The ac didnt worked wproperly and took quote sometimes for the engineerri to come and fix it
3. The putdoor area (pool, alley) is too dark.
4. Black put curtain cant close completely
5. Asking fr a like check out was such a hassle that we had to talk to few people, and finally got approved for a late check out
6. Water prssure on the shower is not good",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1731,Nice stay,40,March 2014,"We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and the bed is comfortable.
The staffs were very friendly and helpful to attend our requests.
Breakfast was so so only as not variety.
The lighting at the swimming pool was very dark and hope the management will improve this.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1732,great room but lack of lightning,40,November 2013,"we've spent 3 nights at the suite room at the haven. we love the room, the bed, the breakfast.
the bathroom was separate with a glass to the bedroom, therefore you will feel awkward if you not stay with your partner.

however the pool was too dark, very lack of lightning and there was a lot of trees around the pool, thats makes me thinking twice before swimming at night. what is the benefit stay in bali if you can not swim at night?",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1733,Another nice stay.,30,March 2014,"I have stayed at the Haven a few times in the past few years. It has some considerable wear to the rooms and is in-need of refurbishment.

Problems faced were that air-conditioning didn't work in the first room - Room 2003. The blackout curtains were too small and let light in in Room 2012 and the final room was nice. There is a significant difference between all rooms at this hotel in terms of the quality/standard in them.

The breakfast buffet is not as titillating as it used to be - not to say it is substandard, however, the buffet used to be one of the attractions to staying at this hotel.

I paid approximately $70 USD p/n including taxes via expedia.com (US website). The Australian Expedia.com.au website was more expensive that the US site and the actual hotel website was even more so expensive. This was during two weeks before Easter 2014.

A nice hotel, good location and would stay here again if on a budget or didn't want to shell out too much. The hotel has reduced the price of their rooms since I was last there - perhaps in part, to accommodate for the tired rooms/shower area etc.?

Either way, if they refurbished their rooms, I would stay there again.

Staff as usual were very nice at the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1734,Bitter sweet experience due to that receptionist,30,March 2014,"The Haven is one of our favourite hotel everytime we travel to Bali. Very good location (in the middle of Seminyak), nice, clean and pretty big room. We had quite unpleasant experience during our last trip to this hotel last month. We arrived in Bali on Thursday afternoon (20th March) and as per the letter that they put on the lifts, they have a ritual to spray insecticide for preventing the dengue mosquito every Thursday. Me, my wife and our one year old kid just laid down on the bed when we notice there were lots of smoke came through our room. The smell was so bad like Baygon and our room was full of it. We called the receptionist straightaway and that guy (we did not recall the name) without feeling guilty just responded on the phone - ""didn't you read the notes about the dengue mosquito smoke. We had put the notes everywhere and the guests are supposed to know about this. Also how would the smoke come inside the room if you keep the door closed"". From the way he responded, he thought that we were making stories and hallucinating. We were not happy with his responses and asked him to just come to prove we were not seeing a thing. We waited outside our room for quite sometimes until we had to call the receptionist for the second time. This time we escalated the incident to the duty manager. The manager (finally) came and confirmed there may be some faulty with our room. He gave us another room and offered a complimentary massage for me and my wife. Such a happy ending after the stupid argument. The moral of the story - thanks for the massage voucher; but the Haven management need to train the receptionist to be more respectful + careful with families (especially with babies!). Remember, the receptionist are the people that represent the face of the hotel - they are the ones that guests first speak with them!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1735,Loved it !,40,January 2014,"Stayed there for 7 nights and a standard room. No complaints. The room was clean, spacious, cool with a large bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful. Walk out the front door to the shops and out the back door to the beach or just sit around the pool and have a cocktail",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1736,Unpleasant,30,December 2013,"I really wanted to like the Haven hotel in Seminyak, however it failed to meet basic standards. My room was old and run down. There were cracks in the ceiling, walls and bathroom (the mirror had stains and blotches all over it). The wifi kept dropping out and the password would change every few days. If you did not use the Internet for a few minutes you would have to log in again from the beginning. It was very frustrating not having a strong signal, and having to continuously log back in. You could only have a short shower as the base would quickly fill with water and over flow into the bathroom. The cleaners did a sub standard job and on 2 occasions did not clean my room at all. I had booked for 1 week but ended up leaving a day earlier as I was dissatisfied with my overall experience of staying at the Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1737,The Haven doesn't have it ...,30,April 2014,"We stayed four days in The Haven.
Was is worth while? Yes and No. Yes because we slept well ( after asking for another room because of a creaking bed) which I find is most important when sleeping in a hotel. Yes, because it’s clean. Important. No, because the finish of the suites ( Tile work -bathroom) is sloppy. Yes, because the swimming pool is very large. No. because they don’t profide a relaxing area at all. Loud rock music, playing Maroon 5 all day long….. that’s not a relaxing or a romantic experience I would say. No, because at sunset time a band in the restaurant is playing so loud that some guests are closing their balcony because of the noise.
The staff though is very friendly and helpfull. Will I come back ? Don't think so. Well, than only for the swimmg pool...… not for the atmosphere….",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1738,Great location ... And pool!,40,April 2014,"This is by far a great hotel to stay at.

Relaxed, informal and TWO pools (a must for kids). Ask for the rooms at the rear of the hotel - it's away from the road, and after staying here several times, the front hotel block always seems louder and busier (think band at the restaurant.

I'd fully recommend this to families as well as couples. We'll be coming back!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1739,"Very bad service, don't stay here",20,April 2014,"I ve been staying in lots of great and five star hotels in bali,in nusa dua,ubud,and seminyak,so far this is the worst!

We booked suite room with 2 bedrooms and it located far away from lobby, that is ok.

Had a bad experiences during breakfast, i ordered omelette and because i had toddler with me so i ask the omelette cooker , his name is Aryadi,to bring it to my table when he finishes and in a rude and half yelling way he said he can not do that for me,

Next one- my 2 year old son love the bread and I bring 1 small bread wrapped in tissue to bring to my room, because my kid needs to go to toilet,guess what, the waiter stopped me and said "" you can not take away food from here!""and he gave his hand in front of my face and force me give the bread to him, this is very embarrassing for me! It looks like I never have eaten bread before and want to steal their bread!, I will never stay in this hotel again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1740,Nice exterior environment and good location,40,April 2014,"As soon as we entered the hotel yard, we received a warm welcome from the staff and we were announced that we had been entitled to a free upgrade to a suite. The pool and environment is amazing specially in the suite area.The room was clean and good. The location was the best thing about this hotel. Being in the suite area gives you a fast access to the back road which leads easily to the beach.The hotel also provides a shuttle bus (from 9 am to 5 pm) which would take you to the nearby areas and you'll have access to chairs and umbrella on the beach till 5 pm only.The swimming pool is cozy and relaxing as you can admire the wonderful garden in the suite area. The breakfast was amazing specially the pancakes and the orange juice. Very pleasant stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1741,Great Stay with The Haven,40,April 2014,"Breakfast 90% great. only Omelette isn't cook on spot. it got leave for few moment.

1742,Nice central location,40,March 2014,"We recently stayed a week at The Haven Seminyak. We booked a standard deluxe room which included breakfast, the breakfast was great! So many choices and even after a week we weren't sick of what they had to offer (Recommend the pancakes). All the staff were extremely friendly and said hello every time they walked past you. On our first night we realised our bed frame was broken so everytime you would get in or out, or even roll over it would make the worst noise like it was going to collapse. That morning I went down to reception and advised of this issue and they said they would arrange something to fix it, this did happen but we found that they only propped it up with pieces of timbers... Worked... kind of.
One of the major negatives we found was the live music they have every night in the front restaurant, if you are trying to get an early night (partner had Bali belly) or if you have young children that go to bed before 10pm there is no hope in getting to sleep, the sound just echos through the complex. The location was great, close to shops, restaurants and walking distance to the beach. My Partner also got a massage from the onsite day spa and he said it was one of the best massages he has ever had.
Overall this is a nice hotel but if I had a choice I would opt to stay in the suites as the area around them are a lot quieter and the pool is nicer.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1743,Best hotel during our stay in Bali!,50,March 2014,"Great exterior, beautiful garden and pool areas. Staff was amazing and very helpful. Great selection of food for breakfast. Our delux room was specious and comfortable. Big bathroom with a shower. A bit too far from the beach but close to the shops and main street.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1744,Family Holiday,30,March 2014,"I have just came back from 13 days in bali at The Haven in a 2 bedroom suite. The staff are amazing and so helpful, they go beyond and above to assist and the breakfast is Devine with a great selection. The suites however are very run down, they need to be renovated and the pool area needs more work as it's very plain and simple. Overall we had a great stay, I would go back there only because how amazing all the staff were there. I give the hotel 3.5 out of 5.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1745,Not too bad,40,March 2014,"Stayed for 2 nights, , kudos to the design of the hotel. Great Exterior and concept. However, didn't much patronize the hotel's facility as not much of time, been busy with outdoor activities.

First of all, Hotel is located at the Central of Seminyak, surrounded with plenty of individual well designed fashionable shops, well enjoy the while also surrended with plenty of restaurant, italian, western, local cuisine which will lighten your day with their food, especially with an affordable price.

While restaurant was mentioned, around hotel area also full of convenient store and Bintang shopping centre which can purchased full necessary items.
Hotel is near to a beach as well, with only 5-10minutes walking distance, beach activity is also available along with it.

Basically hotel stay was great. However, be caution on the airport transfer that being arranged by staff there. Staff mentioned aiport transfer fee @ USD25nett (around 285k RP) while you will be able to find a price @ USD25nett OR 250k RP. Which confused me on the price, nevertheless it's not much different but i thnk it's better with a standardize price to avoid hassle.

PS: Should go to massage, i will recommend Jari Menari, 10-15 minutes walking distance from Haven Bali. Great Massage.

Thanks!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1746,Disappointing Stay,20,March 2014,"We booked a one bedroom suite for 12 nights as we had stayed a couple nights in the hotel section before and we were looking for an affordable hotel to stay in as it was a spur of the moment trip and we didnt want to break our wallet.
To start off with the positives. I love the location of this hotel, its not on the beach, but if you stay in the suites/villa sections then its a short walk out the back entrance to the beach, there are a ton of restaurants and shops everywhere within walking distance. The suites are very affordable, under $100 a night and they are spacious and include a full refrigerator, very convenient and affordable to buy your drinks at circle k (stay out of mini mart, they like to overcharge tourists). The staff is very friendly always greeting you. The breakfast had its highlights, the egg station and pancake/waffle stations mainly.
The reason I gave it a poor rating was based on several reasons. Firstly, the rooms are obviously old and worn, they are badly in need of a renovation. The layout of the rooms is odd also, especially the bathroom. There is a large bathtub but the shower just consists of a nozzle from the ceiling. Getting in and out of the bathtub to take a shower is very dangerous, my wife slipped the first day and had a large bruise on her leg. I addressed this with the front desk and explained we had two small children and this was a real hazard and checked to see if it was possible to switch to another room, after some back and forth she clearly understood, we wanted a room that had a regular shower, we did not care if there was a bathtub or not. She then explained all the rooms are exactly the same except the two bedroom suites and if i wanted to switch to one there would be a charge. She then got on the phone to check the rate and when she was done, she said yes all the rooms are the same except for the two bedroom suites, i told here we had already covered this and i thought she was calling to check the increased rate. She then came back to tell me it would be an extra $150 a night. I explained i could just book one online for $150, so the increase was crazy, she had no idea what i was talking about, so i just gave up. As we had prepaid the hotel, we were stuck here for the duration. I had first booked the hotel for 5 nights and was planning to go somewhere else, but we then decided to just stay there the entire time, so i had two bookings. I clarified this on checkin and the confirmed that I could stay in the same room and the stay would not be interrupted. I received a bill on the 5th night and i figured i should talk to somebody just to make sure. So i went to the front desk in the morning before breakfast and explained i had two bookings and was not checking out. After telling the employee everything, she started talking to me about my previous request for a room upgrade with a separate shower. I was not speaking anything about this, but I said it would be great to switch to a room with a separate shower, she then told me that they don't have any as all rooms are the same and my only choice was to upgrade to a two bedroom suite at the $150 charge. I told her not to worry about it but i wanted to make sure i was all set to stay the next 7 days in the same room and everything was ok, she confirmed. We then went out and came back around lunch time and sure enough our room key did not work as they thought we were checking out.
The breakfast had its ups and downs, the eggs, bacon and sausage, waffles, pancakes and pastries were all pretty good. The rest of the food was basically all cold or luke warm. The coffee was awful, it must be instant coffee. We stayed here for 12 days and its supposed to be a smaller boutique hotel but yet they never remembered our names or room number. On the weekends, we had to wait for a table, not very well planned if you ask me.
The staff here is all very nice, i feel bad saying anything negative about them, but they definitely need better training. Several times i spoke to somebody and they clearly did not understand me but just said yes and my request was forgotten. They have the best of intentions, but they just don't know what they are doing. For example the entrance to the suites has a staircase you must walk up, no handicap or child stroller accessibility. After watching me cary the stroller up and down the stairs for several days, i thought to myself, the entrance to the parking garage is just around the corner, maybe i could go down there straight to the elevator. After asking, i found out it was very convenient and saved em a lot of trouble (its actually faster for anybody who is planning to use the elevator. I wonder why the people who sit out there all day would watch me carry the stroller up and down the stairs (even helping on occasion) would not mention this. I would not stay here again, if you are looking for a budget hotel with 3 star standards and service i guess you get what you pay for.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1747,nice relaxing atmosphere,40,February 2014,"Central situated, with beautiful front terrace / restaurant. Nice design and good rooms. Breakfast stops at 10 am. Be on time, at 10 they take the food immediately away. Good wifi everywhere in the hotel",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1748,Back after a few hours - still great,50,March 2014,"We stayed at the Haven Hotel for one night after a 31 hour flight to Bali. I'd stayed here in the past (see my review) and since it was familiar, I booked it again. I was not disappointed!

Everything was the same from my previous stay in 2011. We booked a hotel room and they put us in the suites which was a nice surprise after such a long flight. Compared to the hotel room, it was generally more spacious and had a balcony over looking the back pool. Service was great, pools are still great. Our friends joined us for late night drinks and the Haven staff kept the bar open for the 6 of us. It was all a very nice experience after traveling so far.

In the morning, we went to the front of the hotel for brekky and they said that we were allowed to have the suites breakfast in the back. Since the front breakfast looked busy and I'd had it before, I was up for trying the suites breakfast. This was a more intimate setting with attentive service. The breakfast had a wide selection and since there were fewer people, our custom orders were ready quickly.

Would I stay here again? Absolutely. I did a good amount of research in 2011 and again in 2014 and have come to the conclusion that for the price and location, it's one of the best.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1749,Mineral water ruin my day,30,March 2014,"Hotel is good, everything is in order, until checking out, front dest charge me for 2 bottles of mineral water which were places outside refrigerator. Turned out those water were not compliment, but cost you almost USD15, about 10x the price of nearby Circle K, huft!
Meanwhile a hotel's tenderloin steak cost you only USD18.
So be carefull guys!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1750,Excellent,50,March 2014,"This was a spur of the moment trip and found the Haven on a deal. 1 bedroom suite for $105 per night. The suite was a separate bedroom and bathroom with a lounge and kitchenette. The suite had a verandah with day bed. Spacious rooms, no big wow factor, but very clean, tidy and well maintained. This hotel is very large in area. The front is about a 5 minute walk from the back, but there are pools all the way down and breakfast is served at both front and back so it is not a problem. The staff are super friendly and obliging. The gardens and grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Breakfast was SUPERB. Apart from the usual buffet, you can have your eggs anyway you like, or you can have fresh made waffles and pancakes. We took the late check out option - the Haveners Club for US $27pp. It gave us full use of the pool, an air conditioned lounge with TV, showers and toilets, an afternoon tea buffet and drinks.
Trying to find anything negative about this place is difficult and I can't think of a thing. Thanks for a great holiday.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1751,Nice stay in Seminyak,40,January 2014,"I travelled alone to Bali for my birthday this year and stayed at The Haven in Seminyak.
I used to be a regular traveller to Bali however wasn't too keen on the way things were going so hadn't been back for around four years. I'm really happy to say that things have certainly improved over there, in Seminyak anyway.
The Haven was well priced, the rooms were very clean and comfortable and the service was quite good. The biggest complaint I have which is the same as many others have commented - the band that plays in the lobby each night is just too loud and the noise carries so easily. I know that on holidays it's not all that uncommon to stay up late but on the odd night that I did want to take it easy, I couldn't even watch TV in my room as it was being drowned out by the noise from the band.

I was really impressed with the hotel spa. I went to visit every day during my stay. Booking ahead meant getting a really good deal so for around USD$20 I was getting a really great 1-hour massage. You can't beat that.

Also, having the hotel staff give me a cake and a card on my birthday was a really lovely touch.

I would really like to go back again and stay in one of the villas as they looked quite nice. I just couldn't justify the price travelling on my own.

Overall a good stay, just tarnished a little by the excess noise of a night.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1752,Wish I own a unit here,50,February 2014,"We were travelling 3 adults and 3 toddlers. We booked 2 bedroom suites. We got the room on the ground floor facing the pool. The bedrooms & the living room are very big. Still got the terrace so we could see the kids swimming. The breakfast buffet was good, many things we could choose from and tasted good too. We (also the kids) were very happy to stay here. The only thing we regret was that we stayed only for a night.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1753,Memorable stay!,50,February 2014,Me and my wife stayed here for 2 nights during our honeymoon. The hotel is really nice. Staff was hospitable and accommodating. I informed the hotel in advance of my honeymoon and they prepared extras which really surprised my wife. That was pleasant indeed. Room was modern and just right for a stay in the city. Swimming pool looks fabulous although we were too busy being cooped up in our room :D Overall a very nice experience indeed. It really is value for money and would definitely make a booking there again should I stop by in Bali.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1754,Nice hotel,40,November 2013,A very good and comfortable 4-star hotel. Refined view with beautiful orchids. Excellent pool. Good breakfast. Everything was in its place. I stayed one week in a beautiful city with an amazing cultural tradition.,The Haven Bali Seminyak

We are loving our stay here, all staff our lovely and friendly and go out of there way to help us, they always smile and muck around.. Because of them we r loving Bali as sometimes on the street the people are a turn off being so pushy,it's great to come back to The Haven to see our friendly staff. Food is amazing and the music is awesome every night!
I didn't up grade our room in the package we got which I was worried that I would be walking into a dump but it's a beautiful room and aircon works great. Free wifi is awesome.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1756,Totally worth to spend for a spectacular night in Bali.,50,October 2013,"Location is strategic very closed to almost everything traveler need: food, entertainment, massages and cab. Walking distance to town ( average speed walking around 10 minutes). Staffs are friendly and willing to advice whenever you need them.

1757,Awesome Place,40,February 2014,"Don't use the hotel 'airport pickup' service charged us 30 dollars and it was only 10 dollars in a taxi.

Awesome hotel otherwise, we did find that the air conditioning only got down to 27 degrees, the shower didnt work and the toilets stank more than any other hotel we stayed in at Bali. We did report this to the hotel for 3 days in a row and engineering came but made no difference.

I do give the hotel 4 stars still because the pool is great and the location as well as breakfast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1758,"3rd time here - not perfect but great location, clean and we'll maintained",40,February 2014,"The Haven is a ""haven"" amongst the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. A perfect location for walkers in one of the main streets of Seminyak. Close to a huge range of eating places. Prices vary enormously on the time of year you are here. Check the 30% and sometimes higher deals. Great pool/s for children and adults. Staff are very helpful and provide feedback.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1759,"Beautiful hotel, great pool and great location at good value",50,February 2014,"My husband and I had a great stay at the Haven. We stayed in a hotel room and not a suite but we could not have been happier with the luxury of the room which was bright, spacious, extremely clean and really comfortable. The rain shower was great also! We stayed on the ground floor and our room opened right out onto the pool, with our own private seating area which was lovely for enjoying a few drinks in the evening. (Every room has its own sitting area or balcony.) The pool itself is set out beautifully with greenery and little water features, it also has a basketball hoop, a small goals and several balls for playing around, but if you are looking to spend all day sunbathing you would be disappointed as it really only gets a lot of sun for about two hours in the afternoon. Breakfast is outstanding, there is heaps of choice and everything is really high quality and tastes great. We never ate at the restaurant there but if the quality is as good as breakfast I'm sure it would be really good, although it is pricey. The hotel's location is great, in the middle of all the shops and restaurants and a 5 min walk to the beach. The hotel also provides a shuttle to the beach every two hours. Don't bother with the beach though until about 5pm when it really starts to come alive. It's really dirty, ugly and quiet during the day and you'll be far more comfortable by the pool. But in the evening all the bars have their coloured bean bags out on the sand and they fill up with locals and tourists drinking and enjoying the music and the surfers as the sun goes down. All in all I would highly recommend The Haven as the room was well priced considering the fantastic standards.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1760,Comfortable hotel in a good location,40,January 2014,My family and i stayed in The Haven for 4 days a week ago. The 2-room hotel suite is affordable for a family of four.

The room I got was clean and well-maintained. My only complaint was that there were no universal electric sockets in the room for international guests to charge their electronics; however, when I did request from housekeeping, they provided me with an adaptor. Still, I wish they could convert at least one or two sockets in the rooms.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1762,Huge rooms and excellent service,50,January 2014,"Stayed in a one-bedroom suite and the unit was excellent. Large TVs in both the lounge and bedroom, 2 separate balconies and plenty of room to spread things around and walk around or lounge around in your own space. Staff were quick and very helpful. Gym was small but good enough for holiday exercise. Breakfast was busy but everything was available.
Air conditioner struggled, maybe because of the room size.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1763,Great place to stay,40,January 2014,"I took my to Bali for the 1st time for her birthday. The Haven is close enough and yet far enough from the hustle and bustle of Kuta.

We will stay in the Villa's next time for some real time out. Terima Kasih.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1764,Customer service very poor,10,December 2013,"My friend and I statyed in the Haven in December last year. When I arrived at the reception desk to check in all the staff members were chatting amongst themselves. I was not greeted with a 'hello here to check in' or even a smile, I had to approach to inform them I would like to check in. When I approached the reception staff during my stay I was greeted with this same kind half assed attitude. Checking out was the same poor attitude and took forever, I was also extremley sick so didn't have the energy for that. poor customer service is just not acceptable.
The standard rooms are very standard. The cleanliness is a lot to be desired, I found black hairs all over the place when I arrived and mould was growing over the bathroom.
The good thing about this hotel is the location, it's very convenientley located but that's about it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

1766,Great hotel!,50,September 2013,"We enjoyed our time at the Haven in Seminyak. We got a good deal off Agoda and stayed in one of the basic rooms for about $70 per night with breakfast. It was very good value for money,a definite 4 star, very clean, good service, nice pool, good air con, good little gym. Breakfast was nice, everything was fresh and eggs, pancakes and waffles made to order. We had dinner there one night and it wasn't great but everything else was lovely. The beds were comfy, bathroom small but manageable. The location is walking distance to the beach if you follow the hotel to the back and then its only a couple of streets back. Its opposite a 7/11 which comes in handy. Down the road from an amazing japanese restaurant. Good location for shopping. Book tours outside of the hotel its much cheaper.

1768,"Great hotel in Seminyak, Bali!",40,July 2013,"There are so many things I like about this hotel.
First, the location. it's located in Seminyak, walking distance from many great restaurants, spas, boutiques. clubs and the beach, but still avoiding the heavy traffic of Kuta.
Second, the premise. The hotel rooms are located in the front part has a large pool, but the villas and the suites are locoed further to the back, and they are absolutely beautiful. I have stayed several times at this hotel, and had stayed in the deluxe room and the suite. The suite is fantastic. It is large (60m2) and is very well designed. It has spacious dining / living room, and the bedroom and bathrooms are very nice as well. There is a large balcony with a bed for you to read or take a nap. The pool is beautiful.
Third, the price. A great value for money.

The area I think they can improve in is the service. It is not quite consistent yet. Sometimes I would get a fantastic service level (e.g. a receptionist took me all the way to my suite, and carried my luggage, and explained about their facilities, and gardeners who greeted you good morning with their beautiful smiles that made your day), and at other times, I would get a very questionable service level (e.g. receptionist who do not know which restaurants are open at 10 pm, while there is one right just a few steps away, and another receptionist who would not lend umbrella to you). Some customer service training and better monitoring should be able to fix this.
The other area is probably their Haven rooms, especially the ones on the ground floor. There were some cleanliness issues.

But overall, I am quite satisfied and will stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1769,The hotel named Haven is not a haven nor heaven...,20,January 2014,"The hotel room are poorly designed and balcony isn't safe or easy to break into. So many black stain on the floor plus the bathroom no privacy and the door in the bathroom is near to the fridge which is very impractical.
We have our breakfast and the people next to us are smoking and flies galore on the restaurant....
Music of the band were so loud till after 10 PM.
Definitely not recommended",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1770,"Hotel Itself is good, staff is poor",30,January 2014,"- It's a Nice hotel with Nice rooms, but quite noisy due to the music At night en swimming pool during day.
- location is excellent
- Breakfast is excellent
- the staff from the reception desk is horrible, rude and didn't give us a warm welcome after a very long trip.
We would not come Back to this hotel, would not recommend it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1771,Find another hotel,20,January 2014,"If you like see through bathrooms then this is the hotel for you. Complete lack of privacy, food less than average, loud band every night, pool in the shade - an overall bad experience. My son was very ill and had to go to hospital and all the staff wanted to know is when I could pay for the extra nights we were there - they were most unhelpful - manager was more than useless - and I certainly would never stay there again. I was not there by choice in the first place as had to fly over urgently. The staff there have a lot to learn from my usual experience of the Balinese culture - a lot of their English was very poor too and very hard to understand. I was not the only person there with issues - the lady next to me was trying to get her money back after they had taken out her money twice for the accommodation !!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1772,Pretty good,40,January 2014,"We stayed at the haven hotel arriving New Year's Eve 2013
We had an early morning flight arriving well before check in time,with the staff doing their best to give us our room ASAP. We went to get some breakfast,came back and our room was ready which was great
Staff at check in and sabeen restaurant were exceptional,quick polite and efficient and the housekeeping did a good job with the rooms
Rooms are ok. This sounds bad but it's not. They are not amazing but are functional and of a high standard of cleanliness and no mould( which is common in bali) beds were comfy and room comes with a DVD player and shower was hot and had plenty of pressure
We utilised the hotel spa which was reasonably priced and very very good
Breakfast was good with plenty of choices and good pastries
The hotel presents really well from the street and from the lobby
Now to the negatives
The design of the hotel amplifies the noise of the pool area and anyone walking through that area/ and the music from the lobby
We found the pool attendant to be quite rude and lacking in customer service( he was definitely the exception not the rule)
The price for the compulsory nye dinner was in my opinion highly excessive $150 usd each for dinner whilst it was good there is no way it was worth it
All in all this is not a 5 star hotel but it is a good hotel which is clean with good service and reasonable food in a good location so if you get a good price, definitely consider staying here",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1773,Good option for families,40,December 2013,"Stayed in a 2BR suite over Xmas. They still need a bit of tweaking to cater for families from a food perspective, but the suites are very spacious and a great design. EXCEPT for this dreaded fashion of a frosted glass divider between em suite and bedroom. NO marriage can survive this...especially with a bit of Bali belly thrown in. Please, hotel designers of the world, this has to stop!

1774,"spacious suite, friendly staff at the Guest Service desk, 5 minutes walk away from beach but still in good location",40,January 2014,"My husband and i stayed here for 4 nights during NYE 2014. we stayed at one of the suite at the corner of each floor, which is fantastic! its about 100sqm i'll say, huge living room with kitchen (include stove, silverware, bowls and plates, utensil can be provided by hotel), sofa.

the best part is the balcony, because our room 310 is at the corner- like most of hotel, the corner room is always bigger than others, it has a L shape balcony (u can access from living room and bedroom) even has a double bed in it!, one raining day i was having wine and end up having a long nap there, it happened to rain a lot during our stay at this hotel and we are fortunate enough to have such a nice big room to spend most of our time in, the view from our balcony is also very nice because there is no higher building in sight.

the facility in the suite is pretty amazing, except the kitchen (no microwave though) , there is a big dining table for 6 person, big sofa area for 6-8 person--one sofa can sleep one person, there is led tv in both in living room and bedroom, stereo with ipod dock, didn't try tho.

bathroom is decent size but with only a big tub and a rain shower head, its a bit hard for a petit size like myself to get in and out of the tub every time. big closet and full size mirror-love it!

the bed and pillows are very comfortable, and its very quiet, we had good sleep during our stay.

we use the guest service quite a few times during our stay, in general, its good, at least the staff work at the guest service desks has better understanding of the western culture and, with more common sense.

the breakfast is basic, varies bakeries plus egg stations and grill sausage/bacon/fish/chicken/beef, fried rice and fruit . the Danish is very good tho, I'm quite impressed.

we had 90 minutes massage in the hotel, which is in one of the villa 601, although it has only two spa rooms, each room is spacious, with a big jacuzzi in it- i think u can only use it if the spa package you are choosing include bath, the room also has private shower and toilet.

the massage is quite good, reasonable price. there is an ad in the hotel says if you book in advance you can get good discount, 3 days ahead you can get 50% off.

although it doesn't look very big from the entrance, this hotel is quite big once you get in, it took us at least 5 minutes walk from the main entrance to our room, first is the standard room building, then the villas, then the suite building. this hotel has two lobby and host breakfast in each lobby, i think this gives you a good idea how big it is. there are also two pools next to each lobby.the pool is very nice and relaxing,

even though its not beach front, its location is still very good, 5 minutes walk from the Bintang super market (a reputable local super market sells all the daily supplies). near many boutique shops and restaurants, the spacious room make it very easy for families, i'll definitely consider it in the future if I travel with groups.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

1776,Well located however somewhat cramped...,30,December 2013,"One can tell that the owners when building this hotel wanted to maximise on space. The rooms are well laid out, minimalistic but dated.
As the buildings are built around the pool areas, sounds made by people around the pool area are somewhat amplified.
Staff is cordial and breakfast is basic.
Security guards are most forthcoming in assisting when one needs to cross the road (hotel on busy street).
Beach front is nothing to write home about...Sadly full of rubbish.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

1778,Moments of Truth (MOT),30,December 2013,"Jan Carlzon of SAS fame spoke about the customer's moment of truth. I noticed a Trip Advisor award prominently displayed behind the front desk at this hotel. But my wife and I had a not too happy experience at this hotel.
For starters, the airconditioning system in this hotel sucks.................it takes an awful long time to reach the desired temperature. We were informed by front office the duration was normally an hour..........our experience, more like three hours or so! This was most disappointing.
In addition, although we stayed on the fourth floor of the hotel, our afternoon siesta was disturbed by screaming and shouting by small kids at the pool below our room.........and our balcony doors were shut. And to top it all, the loud sounds of the band at the Sabeen restaurant could be clearly heard from our room!
Overall, the room was well appointed, clean and comfortable but the twin beds need to be replaced asap. They squeak whenever we turn while sleeping. The service at the Sabeen was friendly and attentive and we would like to commend Rutmini and Nia as well as many others. The breakfast spread while it was generous was quite bland and of average quality.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1779,"Suite haven , private , cozy",40,December 2013,"All the facility is good , nice pool , and i have enjoy the spa , was so good , but the breakfast menu is not delicious , and only 1 menu for local food , and the limit breakfast untill 10am , i hope they can extend the limit time , sometimes its too lazy to wake up early when you on your holiday

The hotel and the suite has different loby , thats why when you stay on suite you get so private

Location is good near to the beach , rent car , food",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1780,Seminyak's own Fawlty Towers....Poor aircon,10,December 2013,"Spent 4 nights here looking to relax but only got a daily dose of stress. Totally unorganised and very unhelpful. Day one we check into our room and find the air conditioning not working very well. Gave it some time time to cool down but after a night of sweating reported it to reception. They send a guy who looks at the control panel and walks out. Asked reception what was happening and they advised ""it will be fixed in 3 to 4 hours. Not ideal but I'm a patient guy so I waited. 4 hours laer still sweating. To their credit they gave me an upgrade to a 1 br suite. Guess what? The air con was not working well here either. Advised reception a number of times, they didnt want to know about it, told me to press the control button. Ended up giving up due to the lack of interest and sweated it out. Next day I asked for a power adaptor. 4 calls to reception later someone finally turns up with one, an hour later another staff member turns up with another one. Next day the security guard refuses my girl friend entry to the hotel as she was returning from work. Informed the manager this was embarassing and not good enough as se had been there for several days with me, he didnt seem to care less and gave me a blank look, not even an apology. Next day my flight is changed and I requested a late check out. You would have thought I was asking for their first born. Someone has the room booked so you cant have late check out. No offer of another room jut a flat out refusal. Spoke to the manager and he was as unhelpful as any manager you will ever meet. No apologies for anything and no atempt to assist. I have stayed in many hotels in Bali, this one has the worst service and is the most disorganised Ihave ever seen. May I also add it is extremely overpriced. Can do so much better for the rate they charge. I wont be ging back to this comedy of a hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1781,An ok experience,30,December 2013,"I stayed in a two bedrooms suite (room 416 and 417 from 10 to 14 Dec 2013. Originally was given another suitebut the aircon in the suite was not working so they shifted us to 416 and 417. However the aircon in the new suite was also not working well. I phoned numerous times at the reception to complain abt the aircon.

The temp was set to 18 degree in the 2 bedrooms and the living room but the rooms were just room temperature. I even had to fan my daughters to sleep at night. Very disappointing in this regard. Thru out my 4 nites, I couldnt feel the cold air from the aircon. However the temp did feel abit better from the 3rd day onwards. Read abit better.

Its was our 2nd time stay in this hotel this year. However my confidence has shaken due to the aircon issue.

Rooms were ok, bed was comfortable. Staff was polite and greet you whenever they walk pass you. Breakfast was good. Rooms were quiet and my family didnt get bitten by mosquitoes during our stay there. Well, it could be also because we were wearing anti mosquito band when going out.

Location was not too bad. Abt a 5 mins walk to the beach. The security guards will help to get a taxi or stop the traffic for you if you need to cross the road. Easy to find resturants, massages and shops.

My kids enjoyed the pool near the lobby where the is a basketball net on the wall of the pool where we can play basketball in the the pool.

Overall it is a good hotel which I will recommend to friends, just hope they are not as unlucky as I am to get rooms with aircon issue.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1782,Lovely place to stay,50,December 2013,"We just spent 8 nights in an apartment at the Haven for my 50th birthday ... What a beautiful place to stay.. staff are amazing and so welcoming. Spent the morning of my birthday in the day spa , what a beautiful experience that was... the nightly entertainment was exceptional.. Food in all areas impressive... Thank you we will definitely be back",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1783,Good but there is better for cheaper,30,May 2013,"I cannot write a review to say this place is bad .. its not. Its just not great. We stayed here a while back but i'm just getting around to writing this review. There was nothing wrong with the staff, the rooms were clean and the breakfast was nice but this place is just lacking in charm and charisma. The location is a little out of the way for us as we like to be amongst the restaurants of oberoi st and petitenget and it is a little to far away from the beach. The place lacks brightness and just really didn't do much for my husband and I. The restaurant is also very expensive for what it is. There is nothing wrong with the haven hotel, its more that there is nothing great about it either. it is just personal preference and opinion but we wont be staying here again. this is purely because we feel although the accommodation is nice we feel there is better value, closer to the action and the beaches.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1784,A Hidden Haven,50,November 2013,"A very pleasant surprise awaited our arrival at The Haven - we had been upgraded to a Haven Suite. Our original booking was for a Junior Suite, which is located in the front section of the property. Our new room was on the first level in the complex at the back of the property, in an area that was more serene and 'exclusive'. This complex also had it's own pool area, and a smaller, more intimate breakfast area. It felt special and secluded :-) The room itself was more like a small apartment, with a separate bedroom/bathroom area, and a large lounge/dining/kitchen area. It also had a long balcony (with table, chairs, day bed) overlooking the lush pool and decking area below.
The property is narrow but extremely long. The rear complex has it's own Reception area too. In between the front and the back there are some single and double villas, and the resort Spa. The front section has the restaurant, main Reception, lounge bar area, and the more hotel-like rooms with their own pool area.
The Haven is well situated for exploring the Seminyak area, and beyond. There is good shopping along the street, which is in a surprisingly good state of repair, and more retail therapy and dining delights are just a short (and inexpensive) taxi ride away.
The beach is only a 5 minute walk down Jalan Double Six, and a good money changer is just up the road.
Staff are very friendly and helpful, and the entire facility is well maintained and very pleasant, although I am very happy to have been upgraded, as the back area, for me, is the much nicer environment.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1785,Very nice!,40,November 2013,"We paid about $70/night. We really enjoyed staying here. It is not located right on the beach, but they do have a beach club on the beach where you can use their chairs and the facility for free. They give you a ride to the beach, or you can walk about 10 minutes. The rooms were clean, people were polite and we enjoyed our stay there. Of course you can find a better place in the area, but for this price, it is definitely satisfactory.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1786,Nice,40,November 2013,"Stayed here in November and was very happy with the stay. Beds were comfy and there was plenty of space. The pool was nice as were the staff and the breakfast was good as well. Location wise, its out of the madness of Kuta so it had that too. Good stay and we left happy.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1787,Surprise Stay: Upgrade to Suites,40,October 2013,"Book through travel agent for just one night in The Haven Hotel, but when we arrive @ The Haven Hotel, they give us surprise, they upgrade us to The Haven Suites (in the back of the The Haven). The Suites have a more spacious room, more serene, with more luxury amenities, and different breakfast area.

Price: the price itself is cheap (USD 65 for hotel room-but they upgrade us to Suite), they have nearly same design with Anantara Uluwatu (which USD 400) a night, they called their design concept ""Naturally Elegant"".

Location: is busy street of main seminyak street, near the shoppes, double six road, and they have a beach club near Cocoon (complimentary transfer between resort and beach club).

Recommended: Yes.
Return To Sleep: Yes, because they've treated us by giving an upgrade.

As usual, I always include photos in each of my reviews on Tripadvisor. - It's Real Review.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1788,What a terrible services,10,November 2013,"we are honeymooners and we just got married on 3rd November 2013, and we stay at the haven from 4Nov to 6 Nov 2013. I already book from october through travel agent and request doyble bed rooms not twins. When we arrived and check in, we get twins room, what a very disappointed for us, i tried to explain that i already request for double bed and guy in the desk just answered it was based on the avaibility of hotels and he offer me to pay extra 50usd to upgrade our room to suite, I just dont get it how come they treat us like that, I was so angry, I said we are honeymooners but he didnt care and insist us to accept twin rooms or pay another extra. The day after he said that we can move to double rooms and at that time we were in a rush due to we go to rafting and staff said will move our luggage so dont worry. We back from rafting and staff gave me the key to our rooms and i found another dissappointment that my apple strudle in the refrigerator was gone, my husband called housekeeping and they said there is no food in there, we were so upset. From the beginning the staff never say sorry, and they choose kept us dissappointment without solution, and when my food gone the staff never said sorry too, they just gave us statement letter that they didnt find our food. Overall we were so upset and dissappointment and never go back to that hotel again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1789,"Clean, Excellent Service, Great Location",40,October 2013,"Recently my partner and I stayed at The Haven Seminyak and we're very impressed with the high level of cleanliness throughout the entire hotel. The buffett breakfast each morning was amazing with a great, fresh variety and the hotel staff were very efficient and friendly.
Overall fantastic and would certainly recommend to stay there!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1790,"GOOD LOCATION, GOOD PRICE, GOOD NOT GREAT HOTEL.",30,October 2013,"Stayed 3 nights before heading to Intercontinental Bali in Jimbaran Bay (see my review)
The Haven is okay, Staff are not friendly at all at the front desk and the lack of maps, guides & brochures in rooms or lobby is frustrating. There is a travel desk open in the day but not really that great.

When Garuda flights get in late at night, would be great to have some literature about the area.
My room was way way way way down the back.. The rooms look over a pool and into the opposite rooms.
The truth is the hotel has no ""Balinese"" flavour.. You could be anywhere!
If you are up at the back of the hotel? Head out the back of the restaurant and down the steps, go left to the end and left again.. in less time it takes to walk to the front of the hotel you are on the street.

The price was reasonable here but I didn't like the distrusting nature ie: There is an entire price list in your room that includes everything including the mattress protector and soap dish!! They also radio someone when you check out to make sure you didn't ""nick"" anything. As I am not a thief and don't even take shampoos etc.. I felt it was OTT..

It is impossible to get anything dry as your room is in constant shadow, I stayed here for convenience and if you are looking for a view this would not be the place.

Breakfast? VERY basic and if you want bacon or eggs? head to a makeshift picnic table, I have no clue why they don't just throw it in the bain marie because it is just sitting on the grill ""cold"" anyway!

Your 2 welcome drinks? Are non alcoholic! So don't expect some exotic welcome cocktail.

Look, It's a basic hotel, clean, air-con works, facilities are ample.. A good location if you want to walk around.
There is a fabulous bar opposite and also a circle K for essentials and you can use their atm.. don't bother with currency exchanges - it's a nightmare! Just use an ATM.

Would I go back? Probably not as it was neither here nor there, I would recommend it on location and ease or for families. It's clean and beds and bathroom do the job.

The front desk staff ALL need to smile, and gain more knowledge and be a bit more helpful.

Oh, and security out the front is good but I think just for show because the back has none, so who is stopping anyone coming in the back entrance??",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1791,Would be nice if it were bordering the beach.,30,October 2013,Very spacious suite includes kitchen but no utensils. We were surprised to hear that we would have to pay for the 2nd bucket of ice. Free bottled water are rather small considering the temperature outside. The bathroom makes a tired impression and could do with a make-over. Service was very friendly and breakfast was pretty nice.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1792,Lovely place to stay in Seminyak,50,October 2013,"We are staying in a standard room which is fine for two- cleaned promptly daily and well kept. The hotel also has suites and villas. While the pool is often crowded in the hotel area, there is a whole other pool in the suites area that is generally not crowded.
Unlike other reviewers, there seem to be plenty of staff even though the resort is definitely big- I've always gotten prompt responses to all requests, always with a smile and excellent service.
The breakfast is outstanding- pretty much anything you could want and plenty of it.
There are live bands that play at Sabeen the restaurant, so the hotel room area can be loud at night- but the bands all stop, as advertised, at 10:00 pm, so this is reasonable.
Hotel is in a good location- walk to beach and shops.
Pool and grounds are very well kept and lovely. I'd stay here again in a minute.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1793,"Good on Price, Good on Service",50,October 2013,"The place is just awesome! Good service, friendly staff, breakfast fed me for the whole day and really modern installations. The three swimmings pools are just fantastic. You can get a driver to get you around inside the hotel, so you don't need to concern about going on the streets and try to find someone. I haven't got the opportunity to use the spa, it was fully booked! Anyway...if you are not planning to spend loads of money on something really ""out-of-space""....I really recommend this place, a good mixed between good price and a bit of ""fancy"" kind of style.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1794,Overpiced,20,September 2013,"The haven is well located, clean and has nice pools, however this venue lacks charm and taking into account the moderate service and moderately styled rooms, this hotel is overpriced. Must be fairly easy to get a better price quality hotel in Seminyak",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1795,Simply comfortable,40,April 2013,"I stayed here few months ago for two nights and have an amazing time. As you know, Seminyak is really crowded area in Bali with a tiny street with full of bike and car. This place is quite spacious, I saw many places with smaller capacity, in this district. I took so many pictures, unfortunately I couldnt post it due to large file size. I guess you can see other picture posted in this property.

The moment you get in the lobby, you will feel release from the craziness happen on the street. As driving through this hotel is quite hectic. The carpark located at the back of the hotel, or downstair, but try avoid downstairs one as it was so small and your car might get scratched. The staff could speak English very well, the check in was quick, the explanation was brief and prompt.

There's quite a walk as they put us on the suite area at the back. But, the staff was so friendly welcoming you and assist your luggage on the way to your room. During our walk, we passed couple of private villa, and looks tempting. I also love the garden with their combination elegant and Balinese touch. The bed was comfortable, bathroom was great but not so modern. The have quite unique remote control holder for all the remotes in the room. The view was great facing the pool and the restaurant. The room come with balcony where you can smoke outside. Our room rate surprisingly include breakfast which was awesome. They have two restaurant, and ours one was at the back (suite area) with more quiet than the one at the front. I couldn't have eat less for that fresh bacon they have. There were plenty staff to assist you in genuine service. The only negative aspect just the location, and carpark which gave you headache and worry whether your car is not scratched. Otherwise, I'll rate 5 for sure.

Plan ahead and book early to get a cheaper rate. We booked in booking.com for your information.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1796,Go for the suite rooms,40,September 2013,"I stayed in the 2 bedroom suites and it was nice. I like the suites as it was spacious. It's perfect for a family traveling with children. The only flaw was the bath tub design. It was so difficult to get in and out from it. The free shuttle to the beach was every 2 hours. They should make it more often. The breakfast was not free for all guests. I was given 4 free breakfast only for 2 bedrooms and children above 5 years old are charged. The breakfast menu was the same every single day. I liked the bacon and sausages, the rest was just boring. In term of location, it's at a very touristy place. It's near over-rated restaurants, shops, and bars. Bali is crazy in traffic. So if you decided to stay in seminyak, I'd suggest you look for activities around this area, like kuta, sunset and legian only. My flight was at 5 pm and I was allowed to check out at 1 pm. However, I thought I could wait at the club lounge but the charge was usd 28 per person. So my family and I just crashed in the suite lobby area which only has 4 small chairs and 1 sofa. The management should consider the arrangement for those guests waiting for their flight.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1797,Simple but complete,50,October 2013,"Nice room, nice bed, big balcony, complete amenities, and big swimming pool. Nice sabeen restaurant, have live music performance every night. I like the breakfast at the back restaurant that on suite building. Quite much choices (mostly serving western) and nice place to have breakfast compare to the restaurant near the lobby. Nice hotel, good location too.. Walking distance, i can go to seminyak Rd., legian 66 beach and sunset point.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1798,My stay in The Haven Seminyak Hotel,30,September 2013,"The hotel is just a couple of streets back from the beach, close to restaurants, shops, bars and the Bali night life. Good location for an early morning walk/run along the beach. I had a really tasty chicken & avocado sandwich for lunch.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1799,Extremely noisy hotel. Look elsewhere unless you are deaf.,20,September 2013,"Stayed 2 weeks at Haven Hotel in a Haven Room, in a wing straight over swimming pool. Here are the most important drawbacks that I have noticed:

- rooms in the wing I stayed face the hotel main entrance from the street linked with the reception that is linked with the restaurant and you are totally exposed to others sight all day long and until 11pm when they switch balcony lights off. Actually most of rooms of this hotel face the same direction.

- ALL balcony lights go off at 11pm everyday (like in prison or so). You are not able to switch your private balcony light off from your room, unless you smash the light globe with a hammer (I did not try though). It makes you even more exposed to others sight. I felt like a hamster in a cage when hundreds of people were looking at me everyday once sitting on my balcony.

- their beds are rock rock! rock!! hard, you better sleep on the floor, as it does not creak and crunch as opposed to the bed. Every your move in the bed is confirmed by a strong crrrrrkk!!!.....crrrrkk!!!...... Such terrible beds, like hundred years old, made by a poor carpenter's hand now from their age falling apart on joints (it's noticeable when you look under) It's a huge shame for a 4star hotel like they pretend to be. After two weeks on that bed I have got strong pain in my back!

- room walls are paper thin, you clearly hear what is happening in the rooms next to yours. Talking, snoring, watching tv, shifting furniture, toilet activity.. - you will hear all those things everyday.

- The hotel is so acoustic by itself, and people slamming their door, everyday housekeeping activity and all those things drive you crazy, and there is no escape from it because after my quick ""inspection"" I can say that this hotel does not have any quiet and peaceful rooms to escape to.

- Terrible sewer smell comes from the toilet area. More, my toilet bowl wasn't properly fixed to the floor, it moved when I was sitting on it, pretty scary.

- The hotel is extremely noisy during day and night. Strong noise, loud music, yelling and that strange echo comes from the pool area everyday. Following that, an unbearable loud live music (louder than in a concert!!) starts in the restaurant about 7pm and ends usually at 10pm. Everything shakes around when they play. Forget about watching tv, not to mention about sleeping. Ear plugs are strongly recommended. I feel for people staying in a front wing, straight over that restaurant. That must have been a real earthquake for them.

other minor things:

Swimming pool is simply small, has a few sun beds and no atmosphere. And all this for hundreds of people staying in the hotel. However this is not a problem comparing to listed above.

Breakfast was OK but for a week stay maximum as it almost does not change at all. After two weeks I had more than enough of their omelettes, sausages, bacon and poor coffee. However that's not a problem comparing to above listed points. You can live with that.

Housekeeping simply does not clean rooms, they only replace soap, gel, toilet paper and towels, however in my case they kept forgetting to leave clean bath towels, it happened a few times. Asking them for a towel that they forgot to leave causes they think you would like to take an extra one.. So hard and confusing to get them understand that they keep forgetting things.
However, this is nothing comparing to the extremely loud music listed above...as you can live without towels or dry yourself with a t-shirt if necessary.

Staff at the reception try to be helpful but they perform their job in poor manners, that you are even more confused than you were before. Try to ask a few people from the staff for the same thing. You will get a few different answers....

Wi-Fi internet is limited and works after you put a login & password obtained at the reception on a small piece of paper. It works for 3 days and after that you have to come back and ask them for another one.... I do not know if they have noticed we lived in 21-st century..

Hotel is located in a very very busy area of Seminyak, just by the loud and totally filled with motorbikes main street. A very convenient area if it comes to use of restaurants and small shops that sell all those basic things you need.

Meals at the restaurant are expensive, drinks even more.

Personally I completely did not like the Seminyak beach as it is black like dirt and has a very bad smelling sewer creek cutting the beach in half. In addition the sewer drops into the Ocean.....

Strange policy during breakfast. You can not come there wearing normally looking complimentary hotel slippers, but you can come there on bare foot and you can smoke cigarettes like a furnace while others try to eat their first meal of the day next to your table. Sitting in a non-smoking area does not work as thick smoke comes everywhere. Breakfast time SHOULD BE a non-smoking time. Why the management can't understand that?

Overall, more negatives than positives after my stay. Reading reviews about this hotel before I was hoping that it is going to be a nice one, however it is not nice. Not nice at all. Lack of green (trees, lawns etc) makes it look like a concrete monster. And oh, I forgot to say - there is constantly performed maintenance work around the hotel. Painting, deck sanding, high-pressure cleaning, banging, hammering etc..Really painful for your eyes and ears.

I will repeat - STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE DEAF OR HAVE REALLY THICK EAR PLUGS.
Otherwise it is a waste of money only. Hope my opinion helps you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1800,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,50,August 2013,"Spent 3 weeks in September in the Suites section this time , firstly in a 2 bedroom Suite then a double room.
The suites are beautifully appointed , very spacious and spotlessy clean , large living , kitchen , dining .Balcony off Master bedroom had a double daybed , perfect for lounging.Breakfast was a little more gourmet than the Hotel breakfast , salmon , chicken , minute steaks cooked to your requirements, a great variation each day. We found the staff very helpful and friendly , always with a smile , no request was a hassle.Spent time at the Haven beach club on Seminyak Beach , big loungers with comfortable cushions and towels provided.Its only a 5 minute walk to the Beach , or 2 minutes in the beach buggy provided by The Haven.
Love this Hotel , husband is back there again at present !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1801,Great Place but Noisy Rooms in the Front,40,August 2013,"I stayed in the Haven for 5 days in August. My first time to book a hotel in the Seminyak area. I was surprised to see how close it is to the main road with all the traffic noise hitting you when wanting to relax at the bar area. It is good for people watching, though.
The room was spacious and big enough for two persons and its minimalist design suites my taste. I just wished I could have given a room towards the back side of the hotel since every afternoon and evening the hotel has a live band at the bar and if one does not feel like listening to their music it is quite impossible to ignore the sounds entering the room. Too bad.
The service was immaculate with all the staff being helpful and accommodating. Breakfast was rich and plenty although I am always kind of surprised that in a coffee producing area like Indonesia most hotels are not able to serve great coffee. If you want to order eggs bring some time with you and do not forget to follow up your order. They kept forgetting it a few times and at times the lines are long.
In all it is a good and stylish hotel to spend a few days in but I would not choose this one for my vacation. It is not close to the beach and too near to the main road for my taste. But if you want to be close to restos and shops that are lined up nearby then this may be the place you are looking for.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1802,The Haven for a quick trip,40,September 2013,"Friend and i checked into 2 rooms at The Haven Friday night, check in was a breeze as we had purchased on line. we were quckly shown to our rooms. What we originaly thought was a small hotel was quickly amended. the hotel consists of 1 block of rooms at the front, the villas in the middle and another 2 blocks of rooms at the end all running in a line. BUT it does not have a BIG hotel feel, there are 2 restauraunts, 1 at each end to enjoy breakfast there are 3 pools running the length of the hotel and more than enough sun loungers to keep people happy. Staff are wonderful and always smilling.
there is a rear access/lobby that alows quick access to Jalan Double Six . Breakfast is enjoyable tho the egg station can get busy. The rooms are very spacious with big bathrooms, excelent water preasure in the shower . Each room had it's own balcony and huge sliding doors that open the room up to include the balcony should you wish to entertain. The bed was huge and very very comfy - never got time to turn on the TV as we only stayed for a couple of days here. Front bar was a great place to sit and watch the goings on in the street whilst enjoying a drink or 2, bar staff keep the drinks flowing and the tables clean always with a smile. I would not hessitate to stay here again tho i'd book on line as it's cheaper than walk in rates which i thought was very unusual ??? Great location on the edge of Legian Seminyak near Jalan Double Six",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1803,Amazing room,40,September 2013,The hotel although located far from the beach has every thing else you want in bali. Access to transportation is a key. I stayed in a suite which was amazing and properly priced. Nice terrace lounge with life music,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1804,Haven Restaurant Review,20,September 2013,"Had the middle eastern pizza and the tandoori shrimp with mango salad. The middle eastern pizza was essentially flat bread with a poor quality bolognese sauce, shrimp tasted good but expensive for 5 peices. They provided bread with balsamic and olive oil to start but only brought one hamburger bun when there were two people. The buns were not fresh. I would not recommend this place to eat at but cannot speak for the hotel. Ate at a restaurant just down the street for literally a quarter of the price and food was substantially better.

Happy Travels!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1805,Bali business trip,20,September 2013,"An average experience for a well located hotel. Poor overall service, door lock key cards constantly timed out or failed, room hygiene so so, mould in bathroom, one room had a wlk in shower, the other a huge bath tub to climb in, overnight food left in kitchen, reception operator often could not understand basic English, we booked a two bedroom suite, one had a DVD player the other did not! No replacement available. Air conditioning could be better, either old unit or requires servicing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1806,The Haven; disappointing in the extreme,10,September 2013,"We stayed at the Haven on the 15th of September; booked via agoda on strong recommendation from friends. On check in I had asked for a late checkout the following day (till 6pm) which was going to cost more than my original booking.
The room was pretty terrible. We had to have twin beds as no other beds were available despite the fact that many other people checked in later than us, the shower flooded the room first, which took two phone calls to reception and a visit to reception to try to get fixed. Then the shower was dripping so we had to get someone back again who left wet muddy footprints on the floor, which again had to be dealt with separately. The bathroom was generally not terrible clean. We were jammed in like sardines at breakfast, the food was nice but there were no plates on offer so i had my breakfast out of a bowl. I couldn't get a cup of coffee for love nor money. To their credit, they were very nice when my partner was sick and called the doctor for us.
After much wrangling I got comped the late checkout (till 5:30) which was nice. To add insult to injury they started water blasting an outdoor sculpture right outside our window at 9 am which went on for most of the day meaning we couldnt even have the balcony door open because of the spray and the noise. Even without the comped late checkout this meant we couldn't use our balcony all morning.
When i went to check out the staff firstly insisted on a room check before I could leave. I have never encountered this before. Then they insisted that I sign a document stating that I has received the late checkout as compensation for the inconveniences we endured and that I would not contact Agoda or any other media in relation to my experience. I said that it was disgraceful which was met by the usual blend of politeness with no actual response. I was prepared to let the whole thing slide until they asked me to sign this document which I feel is wrong in its entirety. It seemed pretty routine to them so I am sure it is happening more than occasionally.
Personally I will never be darkening their door again; that was the last night in Bali, we stayed in 4 different places and the Haven was the most expensive and the most unpleasant. THere are plenty of fine hotels in Bali: Seminyak, there is no reason to endure the Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1807,An Average Experience for Nicely Design Hotel,30,September 2013,"Second time staying in the hotel that is located in the heart of Seminyak.
My first time was last year in their deluxe room in the front wing.
That time I am not impressed with the room and saw the Villa was great.

This time, Me and my partner try to get the villa and it was fully booked.
The hotel ensure us that The Suites are the same design with The Villa. Just without private pool.
When we checked in, the room was totally different.
It was a big room with no snacks on mini bar, the room was just in front of the dining area with staff talking with each other in the evening and gardener fixed the plants in the morning.
Our hot water is broken and we have to wait a few hours to get it fixed.
The internet is not working for the wifi to make it worst because 3G connection is hopeless.

One night in this nicely design hotel is just an average experience for us.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1808,Best service I have ever experienced,50,September 2013,"I have just spent 3 nights at The Haven Hotel. Loved it!

No 1. The best thing about The Haven was the exemplary service! The staff were delightful! Nothing was too much trouble. Many little special things made my stay perfect.
- I requested wine glasses and ice to the room, it was there in minutes (and complimentary).
- They upgraded me to a deluxe room as I booked online requesting a king bed and then on arrival they accommodated my request to move to a room with a bath.
- The house keeping surprised me by making up my room late in the afternoon whilst I spent a few hours done by the pool and had been sleeping during the day when they came earlier. Usually you miss your chance and accept it.
- I left a brochure for a friend at reception and the put it an envelope and slipped it under their door.
- I had a phone message left for me and this was typed, printed and provided to me.

No 2. The food, wine, attentive service and quality bands assured I was very satisfied for many hours in the Sabeen Restaurant with the pleasure looking out over Jalan Seminyak.

No 3. I had an excellent experience in the spa... pure luxury.

No 4. Good location, whilst not on the beach, it's only a 5 min walk.

No 5. Lovely breakfasts

Got a great deal booking through their website.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1809,My favorite stay in Bali.,50,August 2013,"My Mother and I stayed here for four nights on our recent trip to Bali. We stayed in the suites, whose reception faces a more remote alley, and you can easily pick up the shuttle to the beach (or walk, it's only about 7 minutes). The beach chairs and service were very good. The breakfast in the morning was delicious and had a pluthera of options - sometimes kept us full through lunch. We got to try so many tropical fruits. The pool area was so beautiful, lush and peaceful.

The room was clean and HUGE. The bathroom was spacious enough with a waterfall shower and tub. The only weird thing was the frosted glass wall.

We had mixed reviews of the restaurant. The ambience is nice, and faces the busy street which is good for people watching. There was an awesome local singer doing covers one night that we really enjoyed. My Mother had a salad that she thought was very bad, but we ordered the satay that comes on a mini grill and they were spectacular.

We used the spa, which was beautiful and spacious. They had all sorts of deals and discounts, so wish we would have had time to do more!

The staff is so friendly and treated us so well, we really didn't want to leave! They have a lounge for those who have late flights but need to check out.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1810,Great hotel staff. Wifi is terribly annoying,40,September 2013,"This is s good hotel by any standards. The rooms are nice and the staff wonderful.

The service is great.

The only real annoyance is the absurd way they provide wifi. On a smartphone or tablet the connection is dropped frequently requiring you to reconnect and then log in with a provided ID and password. Thus is changed every three days just make it more frustrating. All very frustrating and unnecessary in 2013

You should avoid rooms on any floor close to the front of the hotel. The noise from the live music emanating from the restaurant is unbearable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1811,Great hotel,40,March 2013,Stayed at the Haven for 5 nights. Free Internet was ok but not fast. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was located above the pool but the noise was minimal. Good breakfast. Great spa. Would stay there again as it was enjoyable.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1812,A stunning hotel,50,August 2013,"My partner and I booked 3 days at the Haven and we must say that the experience was amazing from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The staff were amazing, so friendly and welcoming. The room was large, very comfortable, spotless and well equiped. Breakfast was so yummy and the setting was beautiful.
We made use of the beach club, which is a must if you visit. There is a large underground carpark so the motirbike we hired was safe and sound.
Internet connection in our room was very fast.

We used the hotel airport transfer service, which is highly recommended. Cold towels on arrival and as we checked out early, we were given breakfast boxes full of goodies :)

We'll be back again in November for a longer visit....can't wait.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1813,Don't carry your laptop as there is no internet,30,August 2013,"Hi,

This is our first trip to bali for 4 nights. At the check in we were told they upgraded us to a better room so it's less noisy since we had our 10 month old daughter. However, our room faced the second restaurant and is noisy in the morning during the breakfast hour.

Don't worry about Internet. They give You a 3d username and password but it never works. Every time we reported about the crappy Internet speed ( worse than a dial up), they issued a new password and userid. When would they realize its not the username and password but the signal. One of them told us its because you are on the ground floor. So basically, it was never an upgrade for us.

Breakfast is good. Staff greets with a smile. Polite and helpful.

it's better not to carry your laptop or stay somewhere where the Internet is better. Or request a room close to where the router is ;-)

Not a good experience.
Would rate this as a 3-star hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1814,"Wonderful staff and service, excellent Spa",40,August 2013,We stayed in the suites. Wonderful service. The staff were fantastically friendly and couldn't do enough. Breakfast was good. Front of hotel is noises but very quite at the back where the suites are. And the spa is divine.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1815,Very central - would stay again!,40,August 2013,"We stayed at the Haven for 3 nights during our first trip to Bali. As we booked within 14 days of our arrival we received 30% off the total cost, making it a great rate. We stayed in 3 different hotels and found the Haven to be the most central of the lot.
We had a one bedroom suite at the back of the building. It was absolutely beautiful - very spacious and had everything we could have needed. As we were in the back section we did not hear any of the restaurant noise others have spoken about in their reviews. We did find the walk to the front reception could be a bit tedious at times, but found a car park at the back to park our scooters so had less distance to walk to our room.
The staff all seemed very courteous and always said hello as we walked by. The front desk seemed slightly less conversational, however I think that was mostly due to the language barrier. We used their driver service twice to take us on day trips and the driver was so lovely both times.
The breakfast buffet was incredible. There was so much variety that I had something new every day. We called for room service once for dinner and found the food to be of a decent standard.
All in all we had a fantastic 3 night stay and I would not hesitate to stay here again. I would definitely look at staying in one of the private villas as they looked amazing, but the suites were certainly sufficient for us.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1816,Can be noisy!,30,August 2013,"We stayed there for one night, our room was on the ground floor facing the pool. Room was clean, good size, with all the expected amenities for this hotel category. Nevertheless there was too much noise coming from both the pool and the corridor. If you stay there you might want to ask high floor rooms!
Service was friedly and staff helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1817,Front Office a bit Rude,30,May 2013,"i checked my business friend to stay in this hotel one time.
the service at front office was a bit rude, maybe they were tired? LOL
overall hotel is good because of the location.
expect a busy and noisy band playing while you're eating.
oh well .... thank God this hotel is on a good location at seminyak",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1818,Amazing private villas and amazing service!!!! Loved it!!!!!,50,August 2013,"We stayed at the Haven in a suite for the first 6 nights , then upgraded to a private pool villa which was amazing. The suites are excellent large rooms overlooking the pool. However for that little bit extra the private villa is amazing...large bedroom and bathroom and a great private pool that catches the sunlight most of the day.

The service here is amazing.....friendly and professional staff who are so welcoming and always happy to help.

While it is located away from the beach you can get a shuttle every 2 hours to the beach or hire a scooter which is very cheap from nearby shops. Right in the heart of the shopping precinct.

We stayed at the haven for 8 nights at then decided to do 2 nights at the W. (overpriced, not great service) to be honest I would choose the Haven for value for money anyday :)

Thank you for making it a great stay in Bali.... Will defiantly return :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1819,Number 1 Hotel in Bali,50,March 2013,"My wife and I stayed here for a week and it was beautiful.The staff were friendly and helpful,the rooms were nice and the included buffet breakfast is to die for.I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Bali and we will definitely be staying here from now on.We stayed in a pool room which allowed us to walk out from our room and straight into the pool.We had several meals in the restaurant and the meals were great and reasonably priced.We got a great deal on the room prices through the internet.The hotel is huge and can cater for anyone and anything from standard rooms to villas.The property just keeps going back further to where the villas are and worth a look.This is our 5th trip and we have stayed in many hotels and this is our number 1.
If you need a driver then Wayan is very polite and knowledgable and is always happy to work around your schedule, parta_68@yahoo.com tell him Phil and Mr Blackman.
Some great and cheap places to eat in Seminyak are Warung Italia where the pizzas are huge and cheap.Also Bistro Batu Kali where the fire dancers come at night and have to be seen. In Kuta we ate at Gosha and had crumbed frogs legs which were so tasty and the big cocktail drinks were presented in a way that you have to try,Sorry don't want to spoil it. We also ate at Havana club in Kuta down Poppies lane which was cheap and big servings. A definite must do. Jonis restaurant and pool bar is awesome. The food is great and the bands each nite were really enjoyable playing a good mix of music. If you get hot you can jump in the pool to cool down which is positioned within the middle of the restaurant. For Art we went to Art republic in Seminyak and the couple who own it were so nice. Paul who is Australian and Maria is is Indonesion have a wealth of knowledge and some great art and very reasonable prices. IMPORTANT: if you don't feel like b
haggling or just had enough then this is the shop for you. Art Shop 14 (9) and ask for Ketut. All the clothing and bags etc are priced in Aus dollars and are really well priced. If they don't have what you want they will return within a couple of minutes with it. And last but not least for a Tattoo Robin Tattoo in Kuta. I had 3 tattoos whilst there to add to my collection and he was gifted. I gave him a picture of what I wanted and ask to draw it for me.The next day I returned and it was ready. I tested him out by making a small change which he did right in front of me in freehand and away I went. In case he has moved he can easily be found on facebook under Robin Tattoo in Kuta. Hope this helps. I have only listed the best of what we enjoyed on this visit as we went to heaps of other places but these were the very best. Obviously the best way to travel is with a driver or in Bluebird taxis only as they run a meter.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1820,"A hotel with a good standard, close to shops and restaurant but also next to a noisy main road",40,August 2013,"We enjoyed our 5 night stay in the haven, from where we ventured out to the seminyak beach (10 minutes walk or with shuttle 3 times a day ) to the shops and restaurants and spa places close by. The location is convenient albeit also next to the main road with lots of motorbike noise. However this mainly was audible in the restaurant during breakfast. The little gym is well maintained and perfect for a little workout before jumping into the pool. Pool is not huge and lacks a big of privacy as it is in the direct view of all the rooms. Rooms were large enough with a balcony and in a modern design. Bathroom is only closed via a glass door though. We felt that the cleaning particularly of the bath towels and of the coffee cups should have been more through as there were some stains.
Breakfast buffet offered a good choice of hot and cold dishes including some yummy waffles and omelettes. I had the persistent feeling that the juices were not pure and had been watered down though. The hotel basically offers 3 different accommodation types: hotel rooms, villas and suites. The villas and suites are at the back of the hotel which offer a more tranquil and serene setting.
All in all in all a good experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1821,Very good hotel for families in great location,40,August 2013,"No nasty surprises with this hotel - good value, great location, extremely friendly and helpful staff, very nice breakfast with something for everyone. Close to the beach (10 minutes easy/safe walk), loads of restaurants and shops (including Bintang supermarket) near-by, but not too noisy in the hotel grounds. We will stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1822,Lacks Bali feel,30,August 2013,"7 nights of fun in Bali....Shame we didn't feel like we were in a Bali at this hotel :-( Nothing Balineese about it.
Rooms very modern, it felt as though you could have been in any western country in the world.
First night on a second floor room we felt like pigeons in pigeon boxes so we asked to move to a groud floor room where we felt more connected. Pools exposed to people checking in and out...lacking privacy. We requested an upgrade to suites which was more of what we expected, we Highly recommend suites over hotel rooms.
Breakfast was great, other food over priced & not that great.
On a positive note: Over all we enjoyed the beautiful Bali staff at The Haven & our 7 night massage & relaxing girl retreat.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1823,The perfect stay. Total relaxation.,50,August 2013,"From the minute we began our stay , we were catered for by the friendliest staff , each person smiling , and extremely polite. Even speaking with some members of staff they spoke of how nice it was to work at the Haven and it comes across in their work. The Hotel is beside a busy street but once you enter the hotel that is not an issue. The Hotel is lovely and quiet , its pure relaxation. we paid for the breakfast and MY GOD it is good!!! any thing you can think of they had , and it was all so fresh and delicious, It was my favourite part of the holiday. The room we had was by the pool and very clean and tidy. I was anxious at first about leaving stuff out in our room but it is a very safe and friendly hotel and I never once felt anxious leaving stuff like phones charging whilst out of the room. the pool is lovely and sunbeds are always available, The shuttle cart to the beach is brilliant and very convienent , although seminyak beach isn't what I would of hoped. Literally cannot say enough about the hotel . simply perfect",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1824,Fine Hotel,30,August 2013,"Good location, Check in process bit long need do your sell print out voucher from Agoda.com, Long out door corridor to reach room next building. Room are clean, some crack on the floor, Not got information to turn on your mosquito repellent as I got bite by mosquito inside the room. Breakfast are ok. Check out process quite fast.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1825,Good place if you want to party,40,December 2012,"Nice hotel, the rooms are clean and airy, staff is really helpful.The hotel is very busy so if you're looking for a proper ""romantic getaway"" with lots of quiet surroundings, you might want to look elsewhere! I was with friends from Uni so it was all great to be together and party. I got a special deal for this hotel so I wasn't too fussed about the details.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1826,Great location!,40,August 2013,"hi
I recently stayed for 9 nights booking the 1/2 price special and our room was a pool access room up in the front of the hotel..the room was a generous size with all amenities and comfy beds..
You could hear music whilst you at the pool..here are 2 pools good sizes but.the only gripe I have is that there isnt that much sun in the pool area , too many trees and too much shade!

We had a problem with our telephone where it would constantly ring in the middle of the night sometimes at 3 am or 5am just ring once or twice but that was enough to wake me and spoil my sleep!I On the 3rd night it rang for a while and I answered it and told the man that this happens everynight why are you ringing the wrong number and he was very apologetic! I told reception and they wanted to come in and check the line, but thats not the problem , the staff was calling our room all the time by accident! But problem was solved after the 3rd night i just unplugged the phone and nobody could get through!
Breakfast was lovely, delicious pancakes cooked on the spot :) only waited once for a table.
Also had lots of different entertainment on every night & this was entertaining..
The location is great, shopping nearby, and double six beach which has lovely cafe/ bars and restaurants right on the beach with lovely sunsets everynight....A free shuttle goes there every 2 hours daily form the hotel, but no drinks service you need to go next door and order drinks & they bring them to you....
would i stay again...YES...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1827,Affordable hotel in the heart of semiyak!,40,August 2013,"Good location and friendly staff. Ask for the suite rooms if you want a quiet stay, the cheaper rooms will be affected by the music from the bar. Walking distance to the beach is a plus. Convenience shops nearby and nice eateries as well. The suite room is spacious but a little dirty on the floor, with cracks. Wifi works really well throughout the property. Breakfast was great. Bath tub was a little dangerous to climb into and yes, the house keeping staff does loiter around the corridor and chit chat sometimes, which can be annoying for some! Overall a good stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1828,nice,40,August 2013,we had booked a few months back and requested 2 ground floor units and as stated before in past comments check in staff had stuffed that up plus the rooms weren't together as they said we didn't ask for rooms together so that part was our fault the 2 rooms were on upper level after about a hour of desiccation they agree to move us the next day with ground floor and rooms together.the haven is very nice the rooms were pretty clean no complaints .the staff were very friendly and yes there are bands playing every night and finish at 10 pm we love listening the band out night sitting on our balcony. breakfast was great we all agreed it was one of the best we have had in bali their restaurant which is called sabeen well we only went once and once was to often drinks and food were double the price from other places the food was shocking we had a nasi the worst in bali and the other dishes other group members had was no better how can they do a great breakfast and worst dinners can 't figure that one out a nice touch was the guy cleaning our rooms new it was my wife birthday and he made a dog out of the towels he was very nice and showed great customer service when come to clean room by asking if ok to clean and let us now when finished would we stay here again yes we would overall it was good,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1829,ok but expensive,30,August 2013,"The Hotel was comfortable and amenities were quite nice. As with almost all places in Bali, the service was friendly and competent. The rooms are quite small and as they face an internal pool quite noisy but other than that comfortable.
Be aware however that food and drink is very expensive in the hotel even by Balinese Hotel standards. We were told that the mineral water was complimentary however this was just 2x300m bottles and we drank one of the 1.5L mineral water bottles as well assuming that this was also complimentary as it was by the bed and not in the mini bar. However when we checked out we were charged 120,000rp for it or approximately $13 making it by far the most expensive water I have ever had and a little disappointing at the end of the stay to find this out.
Ultimately not a bad hotel but there are better around and the Villa stayed in previously was cheaper and much nicer.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1830,Not for me,20,August 2013,"We booked this hotel on a recommendation from a friend , first they tried to tell us there were no double beds available , but managed to find one when I resisted , then the room was mosquito infested , it is so noisy also with all the family's playing at the pool from 6am , on our last day we were moved to the suites down the back which was much nicer. The rest food is pretty lame and overpriced when there are a few nicer places down at double 6 beach , the area is a fair way from where we preferred to be also I would book something further north",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1831,Excellent wifi connection!,50,July 2013,"Three best things about this hotel : (1) Location; (2) excellent wifi ; (3) good breakfast.
Being on jalan raya Seminyak makes it easy to find and to walk to and fro places and finding taxis, and since the hotel has expanded and opened another entrance to jalan Arjuna you will reach in ten minutes the beach by walking.

My husband had to do some work despite the holiday, and the internet connection never failed in all our nine days stay in the Haven.
Using two rooms with a connecting door, plus the big balcony, making our 'quarter' quite roomy altogether.

The hotel staffs are all genuinely polite and friendly.

Overall, a very good value for money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1832,What a great experience again!,50,July 2013,"This is my second stay at the Haven... Great location, genuine friendly staff. This time I stayed in a two bedroom suite which was great value as was the service.. Yes it did get a bit loud at night but only to be expected in a holiday resort..( quiet by 10 ).. A big Thankyou to John at reception and to the staff in Sabeen..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1833,Beautiful and friendly Hotel,50,February 2013,"We stayed at the Suites at The Haven for a romantic stay - they are incredibly spacious and luxurious. We would definitely stay there again - loved the surrounds, the pools, the food in both restaurants, the breakfasts (delicious and cooked in front of you) and there was a peaceful bar with complimentary drinks and delicious canapés we could drop into in the afternoons and laze about. The staff are really friendly and polite. We would also recommend the Spa. Couldn't fault the place!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1834,Excellent value,50,July 2013,"We stayed in the haven suites with adjoining room which was very roomy and had a large balcony with another bed 3tvs DVD player and can use your own USB connection to

The staff were excellent always happy and very efficient in there work
I can highly recommend this hotel/suites
I will be coming back to the Haven it is close to the shops market and restaurants and they have there own shuttle to take you to the beach with there own deck chairs",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1835,Worst placeto eat in Bali,20,July 2013,"We were a group of 12, staying near The Haven and drawn to eat here because it looked hip and modern.

HUGE mistake!!! The worst food we had in Bali, not because it didn't taste good but because there was so little on the plate. My husband ordered 'Chicken Burrito's', which consisted of 1 burrito cut in half (which obviously meant they could then use the plural). He hate it in 7 bites and bitterly complained of hunger until he got home and devoured the cupboards!

Dinner cost us 5 million rupiah and for that price you should not go home hungry.

Avoid The Haven restaurant at all costs!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1836,Reasonably priced haven in busy area,40,July 2013,"Stayed 4 nights in July with the family in a large and comfortable two bedroom suite. Well located and very reasonably priced. The kitchen amenities were a little sparse but it didn't matter to us as we were never planning to eat in. Tiling in the bathroom was a bit cracked and tired, but everything worked and it was very comfortable. Breakfasts (included in our package) were very good. The two long pools in the middle of the complex are quiet and relaxing and the facility has a beautifully appointed day spa. Things were a little noisy first thing in the mornings when staff are preparing for breakfast in the open air restaurant - but this is a nice place to stay in Bali. The staff at The Haven were always friendly and helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1837,paper thin walls,30,July 2013,"I could not fault them for the rates, service, nor their amenities.

The only let down is that the hotel building does not seem to have had sound proofing work done at all, or at least the wing I stayed in. I could hear the phone from next door ringing off the hook at 6am EVERY MORNING and sometimes even late into the night. Footsteps and other guests padding down the hallway were also audible from inside the room.

So much for calling the hotel a 'haven'...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1838,got an upgrade...excellent service..,40,July 2013,"I had already booked The Haven via travel agent with promo rate (only US$ 75 incl breakfast). When checked in, the lady in reception told me that the room wasn't ready. So i had lunch then go back to hotel around 2pm. She said that my room were upgrade to Suite..wow...What a wonderful room..Spacious,luxurious,and fresh with big balcony and sofa..The pools was amazing and breakfast was OK...definetely come back..Thank you The Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1839,Reasonable hotel in a good location,40,July 2013,"We stayed at the Haven in early July and what you have read on trip advisor is basically correct. We stayed in the suites which are reasonably located to the beach and well located to some good shopping areas. Yes the air con could be better and occasionally, some of the staff are indifferent to your needs[ such as ignoring you for 5 minutes while you wait for a table at breakfast] but its no big deal. And yes the partly frosted window between the bed and the shower is a little weird. The rooms are a good size and the breakfast covered most needs without excelling to great heights. Its a reasonable base to cover this part of Bali and wouldn't be too disappointed if we stayed here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1840,Good hotel,40,July 2013,"We only stayed one night prior to leaving Bali. Staff were really efficient and friendly, hotel well appointed. Only downside was the very loud band in the restaurant on Saturday night, made it difficult to hear conversation in the restaurant and although our room was some distance away we could still hear the band in our room.
Very efficient early morning checkout with a breakfast box waiting for us which was much appreciated.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1841,We got upgraded to a private 2 bedroom villa over 3 levels with a butler!,50,December 2012,"We arrived at the Haven after booking for just one night as we didn't like the place we stayed at the day before. We've been to Bali 7 times over the last 5 years and this trip was for just under a month for myself, my husband and our 16 year old twin daughters. We usually book somewhere for a few days then we 'wing it'. We booked direct online and were told we'd get a discount of 50% so we thought why not. On arrival it was busy and we were told our room wasn't ready, we didn't mind and said that was ok, could we just check in our bags as the girls had some serious shopping in mind and I wanted to go to Carrefour Hypermart to stock up on supplies. I don't know if it was because we were so laid back or if it was because we kind of lost track of the time but we didn't get back until about 4pm and at reception we were told our room had been sold to someone else. I admitI did feel a slight rise of panic but apologized for being late and they said oh no we apologize would you mind being in a villa for the same price (we'd already paid) and that breakfast was being thrown in too. We were so shocked when we were taken through massive wooden doors to our own paradise. First thing to note was the private pool over two levels joined by a waterfall, an the outdoor kitchen and chillout area. The main villa had a massive living room equipped with everything to make the stay enjoyable, cold drinks waiting, and cool facecloths that had been soaked in lavender water, books and all the latest international magazines, there were even straw hats! The bedroom was amazing with one of the most comfortable beds and sheets that were at least 1500 thread count and down pillows and of course another flat screen. then a bathroom vanity area that was his/hers so two of everything a separate glass shower room and the biggest bath like something out of the roman empire with electric curtains to cover the floor to ceiling glass walls oh and another shower outside. Even the toilets were those Japanese robot toilets, 3 in our part of the villa alone. When I wanted to take a bath the butler came and lit candles and aroma oil and also brought me some of the biggest fluffiest towels. Then was a private dressing area and another tv in the bathing area. And this was just for my husband and I, our daughters villa was down some stairs or down the waterfall to the second pool and they had the same luxury only on a slightly smaller scale. All the furnishings were 1st class and very tasteful. The service was impeccable, the vibe was laid back and we found the hotel really quiet even though there were obviously a lot of people staying there. We thought the breakfast was excellent. It was close to the beach so my husband and daughters could have a surf. But you could also take a small electris cart down to the beach if you didn't want to walk. Overall this is an excellent hotel, yes it can get busy but that's to be expected it's Seminyak! But it has a cool and groovy vibe to it, the staff are so friendly and nice, nothing is too much trouble all this and it only cost us $75 AUD!!!!! Would definitely recommend this hotel. It's close to all the cool boutiques, heaps of restaurants nearby and circle K to stock up on small bits and pieces. Oh and it's really easy to get a taxi out the front of hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1842,Best place we stayed in this trip,40,July 2013,"We stayed for 1 week and enjoyed our stay. No complaints about service, facilities or breakfast. The only thing we would change would be that the air conditioning seemed to be preset and was never quite cool enough for us, despite trying to adjust to a cooler setting. This was offset by being able to walk straight outside to the pool and dive in to cool off. Staff were great, always friendly and helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1843,"Gorgeous, Modern Hotel",40,July 2013,"The Haven was the best hotel that we stayed at on our trip to Bali. It is centrally located, you can literally walk down to the market. Besides looking great, it has really modern facilities, a very huge pool, and a good breakfast. The restaurant plays good music upto 10 PM, making it an option if you dont want to go anywhere and just eat in.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1844,"The Haven Hotel, Seminyak",40,July 2013,"My wife and I stayed at the Haven for 5 nights in July 2013. Beautiful hotel, excellent service, great facilities, nice pool and terrific breakfast. Also not too far (approx 500m) from Legian Beach. Only downside is that price is relatively high at $220A per night given the low wages paid to the staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1845,"could have been perfect, but..",30,July 2013,"I stayed at the suite and were happy about the size of the room. I reserved the room through a travel agency and got a reasonable price. Happy also about the cleanliness and the hospitality of the employees. However, i hate the following:

- breakfast menu is boring. Stayed there for 4 days and already bored with the limited option by day 2.

- the design of the bathtub is not friendly for child or older person, as it is too high. Could be dangerous in my opinion.

- the housekeeping service took hours (maybe this is due to the size of the whole resort which is too big).

i also tried the spa service, not really a fan but my friend liked it. As i said, i stayed at the suites and asked for a quiet room prior to my arrival, so i have no noise problem during my stay.

All in all, will be back next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1846,"Great location, but otherwise average",30,August 2012,"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Haven in July 2012. The hotel itself we found lovely, the pools were lovely (although we had trouble finding a spot to sit and place our things amongst all the suntanners at the front pool), the pool beds are very comfy and supplied pool towels high quality. Our room was clean and well kept. We enjoyed the complimentry DVD player which we used on nights we didnt feel like venturing out. The breakfast selection we enjoyed although i agree with other reviews that it was very repetative. The noise was very loud, especially at night with the band going until the early morning, which for us early risers was quite annoying although after the first night we got used to it and slept all the way through.

I had one quite disturbing experience when we ordered room service. We had ordered room service before however my boyfriend was the one to answer the door and pay etc. On this occasion my partner was in the shower and i answered the door. After recieving our food and handing the money over, the male staff member asked if he could keep the change. I was a little confused when he asked me this as previously the waiter had taken our money and returned within a few minutes with our change with which then we tipped them. I replied to the man saying that he could return to our room with the change but he then again said ""no i keep the change?"" again i replied, this time saying that he could return the money when he collects our plate as i was confused and quite frankly intimidated as my partner was not in earshot. For a third time he said ""no i keep the change?' in a questionable tone and as i was becoming more and more uncomfortable with this rude man in my room refusing to bring me back my change i just said fine, yes you can have the change and he left the room with a wide grin on his face. I was very annoyed and upset by this. Even if the money was very little to us, i felt that this was not right and did not deserve a tip for his service.

On another the note we found the food very very overpriced. The quaility was good but servings small. On our first night we had dinner in the hotel and i ordered gnocci; i think it was supposed to be gnocci with spinich and garlic butter, well i definatley had butter! 4 leaves of baby spinich and what looked like a bowl of butter and 10 pieces of gnocci was served. Heart attack on a plate.

Staff were attentative and very friendly. We found the check in to be very slow but check out very quick. We were appreciative of the staff looking after our bags after our check out as we were not leaving seminyak until later that day.

The location was great. Very central and close to the shops. The view from the front area where we ate our breakfast was great! We could have sat there all day just watching people.

Overall we enjoyed the hotel and were quite comfortable there. We however will look for somewhere different on our next trip to bali with a bit better value for money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1847,Overpriced but still better than many others,30,July 2013,"We have travelled to Bali many times over the last 15 years and chose to stay at The Haven after a great experience staying there 2 years ago. We stayed in the suites as the hotel section is crowded and noisy. Definitely wouldn't stay there.
Would have to agree with other comments re the deterioration. We certainly noticed a lot of wear and tear since the last visit. The positives are the rooms are large and having a separate living area, an advantage if friends visit. The suites are very quiet although try and get a room away from the breakfast area as they start setting up early and this can be annoying. We stayed in 405-great spot.The pool is large and never crowded and we always found a lounge without any problem, unlike many other resorts. I don't agree with the comments re the cleaning staff. We found them to be polite, efficient and obliging in every way. As were the staff at reception.Our room was spotless and we stayed for 6 nights.The grounds are lovely and well kept. We booked via the internet and had free access to The Havener's Lounge. Free drinks and canapés from 4-6pm. Great deal. The also provide free showers after checkout-great for us Aussies that have to take the late night flight home. Used the day spa-gorgeous although triple the prices outside the hotel.
The negatives are the the bath/shower set up. This is very challenging and I agree would be impossible if you were elderly or incapacitated in any way. The ledge of the bath is very wide so
getting in out of the shower is an exercise in dexterity. The hotel was at capacity and this caused issues with breakfast service. The area is really not adequate for the number of people and navigating the area is problematic. We had some rain and this really caused chaos as this restricted all seating into the undercover area. Food selection was adequate although the juice came out of a box-sweet, syrupy and nearly undrinkable. Shame when fresh fruit is so freely
available.
We decided to visit a number of other resorts to see what they had to offer and while The Haven may have it's issues it still outranked many of the others even those promoting themselves as exclusive, luxury resorts. One we visited was The Stones-it has great reviews. We found one crowded pool with every room looking into this noisy area. No thanks.
I do believe The Haven is overpriced. I booked online-before the cheap promotion!! and ended up paying close to $285 AUD a night. Pretty pricey for Bali. We stayed on Nusa Lembogan at the Batu Karang and paid $250 for a beautiful suite with stunning ocean views.
Maybe Fiji next year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1848,Don't bother-way better places,10,July 2013,"Been to Bali on numerous occasions, this time the trip was 3 weeks. We decided to book at the Haven for 5 nights for the end of our hoilday. Big mistake, after just staying up the road at the Sing Ken Ken for 5 nights, this place didn't even compare. The last two reviews i just read on trip advisor on the ""Haven""are pretty accurate for what you will experience. The name Haven is rather misleading, you will have a horrible sleep here, the rosters start at 4.30-5, then the traditional Balinese music starts at 8, then the pool music begins on repeat (which if you like 2011/12 pop music you will be stoaked). There's no sound proofing in the rooms, there's gaps in doors (no double glazing here).

Check in is poor, was advised that there were only twin beds available, although we booked one King bed. And you will get the same story, sorry nothing is guaranteed doesn't matter where you booked from blah blah blah. It surprises me that we are in 2013, and this hotel can't figure out how many ""big beds"" it has, nor can it figure out that maybe it shouldn't sell/outsource so many rooms on other booking sites if it can't manage. So we got a big bed (queen) one appeared once I voiced my concerns. However this was room 3001-proberly one of the worst rooms to get, along with any of the other levels in this block. Why?, because unless you plan to be out of the hotel every night till after 10-11pm, you will get to experience/hear rather loudly and clearly the 'wonderful' live music from downstairs in the restaurant, we got to experience live Shania Twain and other latest hits which all sound like karaoke. Made a phone call, and we managed to get another big bed and were moved to room 3015, no more karaoke noise bless, yet all the other noises you read on trip advisor remain.

All the Internet reviews are correct it's slow & you have to log in every time, but quite a few places in Bali are slow. Breakfast is pretty good, but its rather packed its like feeding time at the zoo. The rooms are clean to a 3 star hotel, they don't change the sheets everyday, even when you don't put the card out saying to wish to conserve water etc. The door keys are ridiculous you get locked out of your room nearly daily, and the staff always try blame it on something else (in 5 days we had to get our cards sorted 4days less than ideal).

The hotel would have been a 4 star when it opened, but like most of Bali's quick constructions they show there age pretty quickly it's definitely a 3 star. I've stayed in over 20 hotels in Bali from 2 stars to 5 stars, and this was definitely the worst sleep I have ever had, the rooms need sound proofing to call this place the 'Haven' & like most couples visiting Bali you don't spend much time at the hotel during the day, but if you want a good night sleep don't stay here. Oh and there's no luxury feel here either so save your $120 a night for elsewhere, if you get the room for >$80 a night with breakfast sweet deal but bring ear plugs.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1849,Disappointing,20,June 2013,"Had stayed here with my wife in April 2010 in a standard Haven room and at the time we were satisfied enough, if a little annoyed by the noisy housekeeping in the mornings. Sent parents to stay there in Sep 2011 in a Haven room and they were very happy, especially with the breakfast.

Fast forward to June 2013 and we decided to go to Bali all together (us and the parents), I was a little apprehensive as I wasn't a big fan of Bali in 2010 and much prefer Thailand, but as the parents enjoyed it so much on their trip I decided to give it another try and we booked a 2 bedroom suite. I made the original booking via booking.com and the price was roughly 33m IDR with free cancellation up to 16 days before checkin. Kept my eye on prices and the Haven had a deal where you can book and stay within 14 days and get a 40% discount, so I promptly cancelled the booking.com reservation and rebooked directly with the hotel instead. So far so good.

A couple of days later I received an SMS alert from my Credit Card company saying my card had been charged 22m IDR by the hotel, this was expected so no problem. The next day, I received another alert saying my card had been charged the same amount again. I emailed the reservations department at the hotel and they acknowledged the error and got it sorted out promptly, I was only charged once so that was fine and I have checked that with my CC company.

Arrived on check-in day, we were picked up by the hotel at the airport for free as per the information on their website if you book directly with them. Check-in was ok, a little slow and we were waiting probably 10 mins for everything to be sorted out, I'm not sure what took so long as there were 4 people behind the desk and no other customers. Anyway, not so bad and we were off to the room.

We were in rooms 418 and 419, the 2 bedroom suite is basically just a one bedroom suite (419) with a normal hotel room next door (418) with an adjoining door, hence why 2 room numbers. The suite was ok, I can't say it was bad but I can't say it was particularly awe-inspiring either. The master bedroom (which my wife and I were in) had a double bed (they say it is a king size but it isn't, we have a king size at home and this wasn't as big) and the other bedroom had 2 single beds. We had asked for them to be put together Hollywood style but this wasn't the case so we had to ask housekeeping about it, and they did it the next day, but the parents had to sleep in single beds apart that first night.

The master room had a bath with a shower inside it, we asked for the bath as we have a 6-month old baby and needed to bathe her each day, but climbing in and out of the bath was very difficult due to the large glass panel which covers most of the side of the bath, luckily we are younger but there is NO way this would be suitable for an older couple such as the parents, in their room there was just a walk-in shower which was good enough for them. The only way we could bathe the baby was for one of us to get into the bath with her, there was no space to lean over the side of the path and hold her due to the afforementioned glass. Not a good design at all.

Due to the little one, we asked for a baby cot prior to arrival. Again, this was not there, so I had to go down to reception and ask for it. Within an hour it was there, but in all honestly we may as well not have bothered asking. Anyone with small children will know how difficult it is to get them to sleep in a cot as they always want to sleep in your bed, but this cot was a really cheap and tacky one, it was made of cheap plastic and a net and shook every time the baby moved in it, she never slept one night in it and we didn't feel safe leaving her in it as it looked like it could collapse at any moment, so she ended up in the bed with us every night.

Breakfast on our last visits in 2010 and 2011 respectively were good, this time they are very disappointing. The choice is not that good and we got bored after 3 days as it was just the same small selection of sausages, bacon and eggs, the other 'hot' dishes available were always cold, as were the sausages and bacon on most occasions too. The bread selection is paltry as is the cereal, and often there was no juice for minutes at a time, and we ate at different times not always at 9.45 just before breakfast finished.

The food in the hotel restaurant in the evening was no better, in fact it was worse and left us feeling ripped off as we paid 1.6m IDR for it. The meal in question was the BBQ buffet which seems to be every friday night. There is a reasonable-ish selection of meat, but there are no burgers (at a barbecue, no burgers, really??) and no lamb (despite the hotel staff telling you there is). The side dishes on offer were pretty paltry, in particular the pasta dish which just looked like overdone pasta with some ketchup dolloped on top of it. This wasn't the main issue though, the issue was that the food was COLD again! For the meat buffet, you select your meats and give them to the chef who cooks them on the grill, the food is then brought to your table. It should be hot if it's straight off the grill. My father received a plate of cold meat twice! I also received a plate that was missing half of the stuff I gave them. Not great.

If the elderly western gentlement who is the head chef actually got up from smoking at his table and paid attention once in a while, maybe the food would be better at breakfast and dinner, as it is it's below average and very overpriced in the evening (the breakfast is already included in the room rate). I was told that the owners of the hotel were in town to check on everything while we were there, so if this is the chefs putting on their best for the owners imagine what it's like when they're not here.

Housekeeping is probably one of the most irritating parts of this hotel. It seems to consist mostly of youngish 20 somethings guys who like to hang around chatting to each other and messing around. Unfortunately, our room was next to the housekeeping storeroom, and they think nothing of slamming doors and making lots of noise at 7.30 am every morning. They like to walk down the corridors making lots of noise too. You shouldn't have to put up with that when you're on holiday, it's not relaxing at all. The rooster next door crowing at the same time also doesn't help, and the frogs(!!!!) down next to the pool making noise all night doesn't help you get a good night's sleep either, the hotel staff are obviously oblivious to all of this and couldn't care less. If you want a good night's sleep, don't bank on it here.

Wifi internet access does exist, however you have to login using the details they give you which expire every 3 days. You also get disconnected if you put your phone/laptop/tab down for 2 minutes and have to login again every time, it's very very annoying.

Room access is via electronic key card. I have read reviews from 2-3 years ago where people have complained that they had to get their cards reset every day to get in their rooms. We also had the same problem, with both the cards to 418 and 419. Why this is happening 3 years later is anyone's guess, but it shows me how much this hotel cares about it's guests and listens to them. We were asked if we were holding the card next to a credit card, no we weren't but I've done that in numerous other hotels in the world and never had it happen, this place obviously can't be bothered to solve the problem.

Overall, a very disappointing stay and we won't be back. We actually left Bali 3 days earlier than planned (I won't go into that here, suffice to say we won't be going back to Bali and couldn't wait to get out of that hole, nothing to do with drunken tourists and everything to do with dishonest locals) and our room was prepaid so I didn't expect a refund, but my father had mistakenly opened one of the minibar water bottles (which costs an outrageous 100K IDR, or 7 pounds or 10 dollars) so I thought they might waive that fee considering we'd paid for 3 days we weren't using? No chance.

Save yourself the grief, stay somewhere else, preferably nowhere near Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1850,Terrible Stay,10,July 2013,"We stayed 5 nights at the Haven and was given a room at the rear side of the hotel but alas, the noise at the bar is still audible. To make things worse, there's this constant crowing of the rooster nearby.. even at 2am! Its very difficult to have a good sleep. After staying for 3 nights, we decided to pay more to upgrade to a suite, which is a quieter area.

The experience did not get better as there was miscommunication or maybe a breakdown in the hotel process that made our shift to the suite an unpleasant one. Firstly, we receive a call at 10am informing us that our suite is now vacant and they are preparing the room for us. In the meantime, we should pack our bags and get ready to check in at 3pm. At 2pm, someone from the hotel knocked at our door and said that maybe we should pack our bags and placed them with the reception, i.e. to check out our current room first while waiting for the suite to be ready at 3pm. We did and arrived at the reception with our bags. The receptions were surprised by our action and said that our suite can only be ready at 4pm!! Hey come on, if the suite is not ready, why ask us to check out in the first place and left us wandering at the hotel without a proper room? Are we not paying for the Haven room or Suite. And shouldn't the room be ready by 3pm, which is the proper check-in time indicated in the website?

After checking in to the suite at 4pm, to our horror, our aircon is not working. It was terribly hot. The technician came promptly but till 8pm, was still not able to fix it. We were offered a change a room by the staff but was told to wait for a call from them as they are not sure if the room is ready. At that time, we were wondering why the alternative room was not prepared as a standby when the complain was filed at 4pm. At 915pm, we were ushered to a new room and everything works fine. From 3pm - 9 plus pm, we are losing the opportunity to enjoy the suite which we had paid extra for and these have caused much anxiety for us, who do not know what can happen next. It totally spoil our holiday.

The only positive for the hotel is its breakfast which have a good selection and is delicious. Its staffs, except for the breakdown in communication among departments, are also courteous and never fail to greet you when you walk pass. They are also honest. I had left my phone in the Haven Room and they had helped to retrieve it. Thank you for this. The hotel is also located in a good area with lots of shops around.

Overall, I would not recommend staying in this hotel if the sound proofing of the room and its hotel processes/communications among departments does not improve. Its rooms are also pretty dated.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1851,Never again,10,July 2013,"Staying 5 nights at Haven .. what a disaster.
Booked a room with a king size bed but at check-in was told that I have to stay in a room with twin singles as they don't actually guarantee such things. Awoken in the morning by a loud banging on the door from housekeeping to see if I have laundry to be done? This happens every day around 9am if you don't put the do not disturb sign out. Noise is a problem day and night. It's very hard to get a good nights sleep and through the day music is pumping from around the pool. The Internet is free but ridiculously slow. Breakfast selection is OK, but frankly I was a little put off by the head chief who sits in the restaurant and chain smokes (in the no smoking section). Perhaps the only positive thing I can say is the staff are pleasant and ready to help when they can, but that is a small thing when so many other aspects are a disaster.
Look around there are better alternatives for the same money. I won't be staying here ever again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1852,Had an awesome Trip,40,May 2013,"We visited the Haven in May, the staff were very friendly and helpful, they showed us to our room, speaking in excellent English explaining the facilities. The rooms were clean and the sheets smelt like the sun and the bed was very comfortable.

The breakfast spread was varied with a huge selection of hot food which tasted great. I also noted that they changed the fruit regularly, bringing out fresh plates before the old ones were gone. However the yoghurt they served had separated into a partly watery and solid mixture and had flies in them.

The only thing I was dissatisfied about the hotel was the noise level, although we stayed in a room at the back, on the top floor, we could still hear the singing from the bar, with all the windows and doors shut. It was pretty bad, but they stop at around ten pm. But the main problem was that the family next door was extremely noisy, their children from ran up and down the corridors screaming and slammed doors at around midnight, woke us up with a jolt. The walls of the hotel is pretty thin and we could hear everything. Then they threw opened the balcony door with a slam and turned on the television. They kept us up until late night a little while before dawn. As we had to wake up very early everyday to go touring around Bali, we did nothing to complain about the noise. We were completely exhausted and just wanted to sleep.

I would like the hotel staff to check the door dampers/closers regularly, as in some rooms it might be broken, and also install rubber tubing in the balcony/toilet doors so they wouldn't slam if the guests closed them hard. Also please advise the guests to not turn on the television with the balcony doors open.

Still for the price this hotel is an excellent choice, it is very near to various restaurants and shops and just 10minutes away from the beach. There is no reason not to choose this hotel, well not if you're not the early sleeper/riser type.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1853,Central location - read the room tips!,40,June 2013,"Stayed at The Haven recently as attending course in the hotel. After reading all the room tips we asked for and were given a room at the rear of the hotel on the uppermost floor. Next time we will book a suite so as to be even quieter. We had no problems at all with our stay except that 2 nights we experienced noise from other rooms when guests sat and ? partied on their balconies which was not appreciated I am sure by many other guests!
Room service was quick and food tasty. Breakfasts great - loads of choice. Did not have dinner in hotel at all. Laundry was good - not that expensive compared to most hotel laundry services.
Room was clean and bed fairly comfortable, bathroom good - nice shower - good water pressure.
Overall a good stay - location excellent - 5 min walk to beach if walk thru the hotel to the rear entrance.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1854,Couldn't fault The Haven,50,June 2013,"Booked in with a Virgin airlines package, and as first timers we checked the Tripadvisor reviews. Five days at The Haven passed in a relaxing manner and with one exception, The Haven is perfect.

The food, the service, the wi- fi, the air conditioning, the room facilities, the hundred channel international TV, the pools and the staff are brilliant.
Then the shrewd reception staff try it on to put is in the hell hole which passes for the rooms between reception and the extremely busy main road. Between the traffic noise, honking horns, whistle blowing security staff, dreadful westerners performing karaoke in the restaurant downstairs and THAT #%¥€ rooster next door only those with serious hearing impairments or those partying elsewhere til dawn could be spared the torture of these rooms.

Like everyone else spending a night in a front room we insisted on a move to the rear of the hotel the following day
All noise except that. £#%¥€ rooster disappeared. Reception staff were mildly helpful to be generous.

In summary a brilliant hotel, next time a Villa at the rear of the hotel.

To my fellow travellers reading Tripadvisor do not EVER accept a room roadside of reception unless for your mother in law",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1855,Amazing hotel,50,June 2013,"I just got back from Bali, hotel ""The Haven"" with my boyfriend .The hotel was amazing and the staff were extremely polite and helpful. The room was cleaned to perfection every morning, new toothbrush and toothpaste every day, cold bottles of water and fresh sheets every day. Not once we saw a bug or a mosquito in the room. The staff were doing their best to accommodate us. Everything we asked for, got it in no time. Breakfast was served every day between 7 and 10. The food was great, freshly made eggs in front of you, pancakes and waffles, fresh fruit and drinks.
The location of the hotel is great. On the main street with lots of shops and 24h snack markets. Less than 10min walk to the beach. We rented a scooter for $6 a day, from across the street, and went all over the island. It is not located in the ""party zone"" with all the clubs and bars, but it is very close to it, about $2 with a taxi. we never head the noise from the scooters and cars on the main street, just in front of it, since the rooms are in the back.

I would definitely go back there again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1856,Fabulous hotel great location,50,June 2013,We stayed as a group of 5 in a 2 bed suite and a 1 bed suite. Wonderful facilities great to have the space of the lounge/dining and also the full size fridge. Also the added bonuse of club room facilities with free canapés and drinks between 4-6 was a big bonus. Great hotel would definitely stay again.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1857,Nice enough...,30,May 2013,Our first night was a disaster! No sleep due to being in a room directly above the restaurant and closest to Legian St. So noisy!! Then a rooster started up at 4 in the morning!! Asked to be moved the next morning and was put in a lovely room toward the rear of the hotel (couldn't hear the rooster from there either until we got to breakfast!). The food at the restaurant and from room service was acceptable but nothing to rave about. We had a great night at the restaurant on one particular night where a band played. The location is excellent. Wouldn't object to staying again but not my first choice of hotel to stay at in Bali.,The Haven Bali Seminyak

I admit I was being difficult (dont know why???) but staff were very welcoming and understanding. Spoke great English and never waived on their keenness to help me. Rooms were large and well appointed. The balcony overlooking the pool was nice. Ammenities in the bathroom were good. Supermarket is just up the road and surrounding shops are a nice mix of market style and botique.
Finally Breakfast was amazing, great variety, fresh and tasty. Nice little bar and resturant area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1859,disappointing,30,June 2013,"Unfortunately I have to give this hotel 2 thumbs down.

Room service was slow and they didn't even clean the dirty dishes out of the sink in the turn down service.

The hotel also said it had a pool bar. This was false, i didn't see one. The room also isn't sealed off at the front door so the aircon doesnt work properly and insects can get in.

The toilet is not sectioned off properly from the bedroom either so you can see, hear and smell any use of the toilet within the bedroom.

The breakfast was great though. Banana pancakes were brilliant, made at request from a very talented man.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1860,Excellent overall,50,June 2013,"All is excellent. I definitely go back here again.
Good location in busy Seminyak, modern outlook and spacious room interior.

Hope they can keep things in excellent way like this.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1861,I got upgraded so was very happy.,50,December 2012,"I was upgraded to a suite so was more than happy with my stay. Huge sweet with great facilities, loved the bathroom. Breakfast was really nice and location is good for most things, not if you want to walk to beach though...

The only thing I would say to anyone with difficulties walking, from reception to the suites is a long way! Although there may have been a back entrance, not sure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1862,Excellent Accomodations and Service,40,May 2013,"My daughter and I stayed in the hotel for 5 nights in May 2013. The hotel is very nice and the staff is excellent, although the front desk staff is a bit difficult. The pool area is rather small, but the beach is within walking distance. Every evening a band plays in the Sabeen restaurant at the front of the hotel, so ask for a room near the back. The band stops playing about 9:30 p.m. each night, so the noise does not interfere with sleeping.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1863,good hotel away from hustle and bustle,40,May 2013,Stayed in The Haven for 3 nights last week in the 1 bedroom suite. Room was clean and very comfortable. The swimming pool for the suites were also quiet and away from the hotel pool which was more crowded. The place just gave you a zen feeling. Only complaints were that the suites were quite a long walk from the hotel entrance and that the climbing out of the bathtub was quite difficult. Something about the design of the bathtub just seems different from other hotel bathtubs.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1864,Incompetence at its best,10,April 2013,"We stayed here along with friends and families for our wedding. It was our third time at The Haven - everytime we had issues - but each stay they got worse and worse.
Our group had suites, villa's and hotel rooms booked for 5 nights. I have too many horror stories to mention here - the reception staff are money hungry smiling assasins. The management are incompetent and the general manager oversees all of this and does nothing.
This is only now written after complete ignorance from management.
A couple of the outstanding issues:-
1. My elderly mother slipped on very slippery wet tiles in a public walkway walking to her room. Matter reported to reception - not even a phone call or follow up from management regarding her welfare. The only thing she got were constant requests and bullying for more money from the reception as they kept getting the room bills mixed up...absolute disgrace.
2. Brother in law broke a glass in his suite. Immediately reported matter to reception for a broom and clean-up. 5 minutes later, a bill slipped under the door for the cost of the glass!!! This family were staying in a suite worth $300 US a night!
3. Asked reception for laundry location - said it was 10 minutes walk away - we decided to put it into hotel laundry. They charged us $90 US for a bag. The next day, we saw a laundry next door...
4. If you are going for a special occasion, in the hope that a chocolate or flowers may be left for you, dont bother staying here. Our group spent tens of thousands of dollars and we didnt get so much as a card congratulating us on our wedding.
If you like the feeling of 'just give us your money, who cares about the people' - stay here.
The shame is - a great location, nice rooms and grounds etc...but never again!!!
We then checked out and went to another hotel for a few days and it was like the total opposite...this is a management problem.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1865,"In the heart of seminyak, clean and spacious.",50,May 2013,"Stayed in the two bedroom suites. This is our second stay in the haven. The suites was very nice, clean and spacious. The only problem is that there was no microwave. They have electric stove, but because we have a baby, it was very time consuming to heat up the milk from the stove. Otherwise, everything else is clean and spacious. Although if u have light sleeper baby like ours, try not to get the room closer to the pool, it can be very noisy. The staffs are always very friendly and helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1866,Tranquil retreat in busy Seminyak,50,May 2013,"My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights, just recently in May 2013.

We stayed in a hotel room which is towards the front of the property and is near the Sabeen restaurant. A band usually plays in the front restaurant most nights, but they don't play too late, so we didn't have any noisy disruptions during the evenings. Towards the back end of The Haven in the more quieter end of the property are the villas, suites and spa.

The hotel room is perfect for travelling couples who still want the Haven experience but are on a budget. The Haven room was clean and provided enough space for 2 people. There was also a small balcony which looks out on the hotel pool and cascading water features.

The staff were very friendly, and provided us with excellent service throughout our stay.

The Haven is perfectly situated for the needs of any visitor, with restaurants, convenience stores, ATMS and shops right outside the hotel.

The Haven is great value and is ideal for couples, or for anyone looking for a relaxing stay in the busy Kuta/Seminyak area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1867,Better than my expectation,50,May 2013,"Bali has myriad of hotels, from backpacker ghettos to luxurious properties. With abundant choices in each category, choosing a hotel isn't an easy task. The Haven with its hotel rooms, suites and villas with its contemporary tropical setting is a comfy property in between frenetic Kuta and trendy Seminyak. It has series of buildings, started from hotel wing in front, villas, and suites wings. Hotel and suites wings, each has its own pool and restaurant.
The Haven isn't a beachfront property though, but it has a small beach club on the beach, just opposite Cocoon. They have free shuttles, but its just 15 minutes walk from main entrance to the club. The Haven is not located in the middle of dining and entertainment areas also, but just convenience with plenty of taxis.
The hotel room is simple, with a combination use of wood, marble, glass and reflects modern tropical architecture. The bathroom and bed room are only separated by a glass wall, which is blurred in its middle part. Rooms has a decent size plus a balcony facing the pool, but this isn't a type of property fit for anyone who intends to spend most of his/ her time inside the room doing nothing. This fits more to active one who goes back to his/her room after a day out finding it clean and comfortable with a possibility to dip in nice pools. Bathroom kits, towels, bed, bed linens, pillows are in good quality. Water pressure, TV channels, air conditioner work properly also.
It has a beautiful landscape, where Its main pool area is more showy. While its suites pool is more relaxed and secluded with modern tropical feel. It also has a spa in villas area, but its prices are quite steep.
I stayed there as a group of conventioneers. Check in and check out were handled efficiently. I see that staff is hospitable, but not obstructive. The breakfast variety is OK, but its quality is excellence, ways better than other four star properties.
Definitely want to go back there someday, but next time would be in a suite with my family.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1868,Fancy pancy hotel,30,May 2013,"Great location on main (shopping) street in Seminyak. Stayed in Hotel suites, that was very nice. Staff a bit impersonal. Found take out food in the fridge from former occupants. Told this in the reception, but the old food didn't go :o(
Only paid a very low discounted rate, therefore the price/quality ratio was great, but would not recommend if you have to pay normal price.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1869,Another great stay at The Haven,50,May 2013,"This is the second time my girlfriend and I have stayed at The Haven in a two bedroom suite. Large, comfortable, great service by all the staff throughout the hotel. We love the pool areas because they are quiet but this may not suit everyone - not a 'young' scene. We had an issue with our TV and received very prompt service and problem fixed. My girlfriend had a birthday during our stay and they surprised us with a birthday cake - they had noticed her DOB on her passport. Bar area is a great place for a drink after all the shopping and site seeing. Breakfast caters for everyone.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1870,"Good location,nice breakfast,nice surroundings,value for money",50,March 2013,"The Haven is a very huge area stretching from the main road at Jalan Raya Seminyak and end at the other side, which is entrance to Horison hotel at Jalan Arjuna to beach area.Location offers very good access to retails shops and restaurants.We book a hotel Room and are fairly new but kept very clean. You can book a villa or suites room too.All the rooms come with a small balcony, there are two pool areas,one which situated at the suites are quieter.In the morning understand that there is buggy service provided to their hotel beach club. The breakfast buffet was very good with a spread of Western and Balinese varieties,an egg station as well as order of your freshly made waffles and pancakes.The staff is very friendly and tries their best to accommodate all our requests but could not check us in early at 12noon although the hotel was not fully occupied, so we had to leave our bags and came back later to check in. The biggest plus was the provision of the Departure Lounge, as we had an evening flight during our last day where they provide a relaxing area complete with shower facilities and lounge area with tv to use until our departure.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1871,"the good, bad and ugly",30,May 2013,"the good.....
l was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay here for 5 nights, purchased my rate via interenet site agoda and got an exceptional price. Based purely on room only this hotel is very good in fact excellent for the price, staff are helpful and always friendly , my room was fresh, crsip and clean, beds are very comfortable and all ammenities were in working order, bathroom was generous with a great shower, in room safe and good air con, balcony etc.... room 4017 great!!! good position and view, not bad looking food seemed to be coming out to ajoining tables although w e never ate in the hotel other than at breakfast the cafe part on the street side was always bustling
the bad....
no money changing facility in the hotel and no room service after 11pm , this is not a resort style hotel with lush tropical gardens the pool area is blandish however it does the job it is also very noisy being very family orientated hotel and can be noisy until the band finishes downstairs mid late evening. Breakfast was mediocre compared with most other properties l have used in Bali although definatley adequate with the usual selection watching the chefs make omelettes was torture over cooked and poorly constructed quite hideous in fact so we opted for fried eggs on other days which were fine, the bain marie selection was OK to be fair certainly not impressive, service however was very attentive, this property is road side and sits at the beginning of seminyak and is not close to better restaurants or higher end retaill of oberoi road . Where the taxii's pull in kerbside there is no over cover shelter so getting out of cabs with luggage etc... in the pouring rain can be problematic.
the ugly...
senior expat chef's sitting nearby in the restaurant in chef's uniforms smoking l thought was pretty disgusting from personnel that should clearly no better even in asia l think this is unacceptable and very un professional.

summary
for a holiday of value l would highly recommend this property, it is not for me but l would say enjoy this hotel for what it is and don't criticize it for what it isn't",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1872,Nice hyotel strange room layout,40,May 2013,"We stayed for two nights here. The location is very central and the Hotel is well maintained and rooms are clean. Breakfast was good with allot of choice. My only issue was the lay out of the rooms in the heaven suit. The bathroom faces the bed and it has only frosted glass that you can clearly see through so not only can you see everything that goes on in the bathroom due to the thin glass you can also hear everything. Not sure who designed that room but clearly didnt take into account you can see and hear ur partner on the toilet which isnt all that romantic. Other than that nice hotel, friendly reception and nice pool.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1873,Comfortable and centrally located,30,May 2013,"The Haven is very centrally located and offers very good access to retails shops and restaurants. In fact there is a supermarket just right in front of the hotel. It is however more of a business or city hotel, as it faces the main road, often crowded with traffic jams.

Rooms are very new and kept very clean. All the rooms come with a small balcony, my room however faced the swimming pool and was quite noisy. There is free wi-fi provided however it was not very stable and many times we had to re-login to re-establish connection. The breakfast buffet was small but very good with a decent spread of Western and Balinese varieties. There was also an egg station as well as waffles to delight the little ones.

However, the staff is very friendly and tries their best to accommodate all our requests. For the price the hotel offers, it is very good value for money. The biggest plus for The Haven Seminyak is its location, it is only 5 mins by taxi to Seminyak Square, and 3-5 mins walk to popular eateries like Warung Mades. I would stay in this hotel for business or a stopover if I am flying in on a late flight.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1874,a great place to stay for traveling with family & friends,40,May 2013,"i was at this place on 8 may until 12 may 2013 it was a fun trip with my friends, we booked 3 adjoining suites, the haven was a heavenly place to stay, in spite the location isn't on the beach front but actually its only 5 minutes drive to double six beach area.

the hotel architecture was beautiful, rooms were clean & comfortable, the only downside was the room access cards, we had to renewed it everyday, i didn't know what caused it but we little bit annoyed with the access card behavior, during the stay we always had breakfast at the hotel, they have plenty of choices menu selectionsm but im not suggest you to order a room service, last time we ordered a porridge, they charged Rp 20.000 for the tray so the cost for a porridge is Rp 45.000/ portion . i didnt mind to pay Rp 45.000 for a porridge but why they have to charge the tray? its like a hidden fee's & I don't like to be treated like that

overall it was a pleasant trip & wonderful place to stay",The Haven Bali Seminyak

It was a perfect room on the top floor.The Wi-fi service was surprisingly good and the buffet breakfast spread was extremely good. My brothers enjoyed it the most. The location was good for shopping and dining. All the staff were very polite. On our last day, my mum received a complimentary birthday cake from the hotel and she was pleasantly surprised. I guess, it all comes to one question in the end...will I stay in this hotel again or suggest it to others...and my definite answer would be..YES.!!! Thank you, The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1876,Perfect Stay at The Haven.,50,May 2013,"We had booked for 10 nights at a different 3 bedroom villa in Seminyak but left after 2 nights with faulty air con and poor room standards. We looked at The Haven and spent 8 nights there in a 2 Bedroom Suite, (4 adults and 2 kids). It was excellent, the rooms were clean, large and modern. The pools and grounds were perfectly maintained, the restaurant and room service food was of a very high standard and reasonably priced, breakfast was very good with a decent range of foods. Staff were always friendly and helpful, only minor issue was the lighting in the bedroom and bathroom needs to be brighter. Would definitely stay at The Haven again. Great location and great facilities made it a perfect holiday.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1877,Good property with modern day facilities,40,May 2013,"It was a tedious check in process and after that we were led to our rooms, kind of tired with the travel from Chennai to Bali with a break in KL, collapsed. Our room in particular had a AC problem and my wife who cannot take the heat as her asthama aggrivates we had to make persistant requests for improvement. By the night fall the problem still persisted and they came out with a solution by providing a Air cooler. Thankfully next day they changed us to a different room and problem of airconditioning vanished there after.
The day we landed had our meal in the hotel and it was a huge trial and error process for placing our order. finally we ended up having a long dinner and lots to eat, since the ordering went haywire. This city is not very friendly to vegetarians.
It has a large pool, where my daughter enjoyed her swim. Breakfast is a good spread and as usual limited choice for pure vegetarians. But confectionary is something one can freak out. Choice of juices and fruits is also quite liberal",The Haven Bali Seminyak

1879,Nice Place in Seminyak,40,May 2013,"Stayed for 4 nights. Good location - very close to shopping along the main street, and restaurants. 10 minute walk from the beach. I booked a single room, and they upgraded me to a suite. Very nice and clean suite with large balcony overlooking the beautiful pool surrounded by trees and vegetation. Staff seemed pretty nice, though I did have to ask for clean bath towels 3 times one day 9not sure if that was a fluke, or is normal).
Breakfast was pretty good - they varied the menu every day.
Booked it on expedia, and it was almost 1/2 the price of booking directly with the hotel!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1880,Main lobby located stratagic place but rooms are sooooo far from the lobby,20,May 2013,Not really banliness style but modern style hotel. Lobby located seminyak road but from lobby to suite room takes abt 10mnt. Management here still doesnt know how to handle customers. Totally middle grade hotel.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1881,Comfortable and convienient,40,April 2013,"Travelled in April for work. 3 pax , stayed at suites 416&417, interconnecting rooms.

Location is excellent, probably out beat all, if you are in Seminyak for the shopping bit. The beach is within 10min walking, or you can take their shuttle from the Suites entrance.

Suite rooms are spacious, with TV in each room and living. Beds were comfortable and clean sheets and towels. The area where the suites are is alot more quiet and more far in fro the shopping strip, so we had good night rest.

Staff are cheerful and polite on the grounds.

The living and dining/kitchette is spacious, and the balcony with day bed is nice. Could easily hold a party for 10-15 comfortably.

However, on the first night, the main suite room air conditioning was not working and the technician only showed up after 2 phone calls and we had to wait up past midnight.

Wifi drops in the evening and everynow and then, and the log in passcode the give out is only up to 5 pax. After a coupld of days, we had to get a new passcode.

The keycard fails almost every other day. And my other colleague staying at the hotel side had to update he keycard everyday. Also, there is noise issue everynight. Room doors do not block out sound much. Band still playing at full blast at 11pm and can be heard in the room. In the morning, the poolside activities were very audible with the sliding doors shut.

So, if you don't mind company and are a heavy sleeper, the hotel would be a cheaper alternative. Also the hotel rooms are almost closer to Seminyak shopping strip.

I'd only stay there for the location and in the Suites.. for the value. But not the hotel rooms though.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1882,worth staying,50,April 2013,"Went there in end of april. Found it to be an excellent location with shops and spa just ouside the hotel. Transport is never ever going to be a problem. Within the hotel, they have a day tour booth (as compared to others where you got to walk out for it..more reliable, I would like to believe). Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Do book the suites as they are more ""inside"" and quieter for just a few more dollars. Worth it as they have a full sized kitchen and living room. they even have day bed at the balcony. If you ever book this hotel, do opt for the breakfast! a very great spread! The beach is only a short distance away where you can have dinner by the sea.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1883,The Makings of a Good Hotel,30,April 2013,"I stayed at this hotel from 3 to 19 April (with the exception of 17 - 18 April), 2013. I had a one bedroom suite. The hotel is well situated on Jl Legian at the Seminyak end and is within 7 minutes walk of the beach. There are many nice cafes in the vicinity and the eat-street of Jl Laksamana in Seminyak is a short taxi ride away. The gay street of Jl Dyna Pura is a short walk away.
As for the hotel, the room was very spacious and well appointed. It was very clean and for me the house keeping staff of this hotel are the unrecognised heros of the hotel. They are pleasant and efficient and were willing to clean my room earlier than they normally would.
Breakfast was well provided for, although with little variation. The staff were unfailingly courteous.
However, the air-conditioning in each of the three rooms I stayed in was an issue. They finally got it working after 2 days in the first room, I had to move from the second and in the third it was inefficient but as I was only there one night it was not worth the hassle.
The real drawback to this hotel was the reception staff. To get anything done required repeat requests, be it air-conditioning, trying to get a parcel delivered from a cargo company, and arranging a late checkout after such a long stay required a super-human effort.
This is a well appointed hotel and with some compulsory customer service training for the receptions staff, it could be a very fine and good-value-for money hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1884,Cancel your booking. Pronto!,10,April 2013,"Spent two days at the Haven , Seminyak.Shabby service, airconditioning that does not work,poor breakfast buffet, mediocre bathrooms with tubs hard to get in or out of.

1887,"Nice clean room, convenient location, but a bit noisy...",30,April 2013,"I stayed at the hotel. The room was clean and I have nothing to complain about, and the location of the hotel is very convenient. You could walk to the shopping places and should you need a taxi, they are just right outside, passing any other minute.

However, even though my room is on the 4th floor I could hear people walking around downstairs at the corridor. And I could have sung along with their live music they played down at the lobby, because it was so loud. True, it stopped at 10pm but it's kinda annoying if you are in your room.

I didn't get a good bargain for this room, so for the price I paid it was kind of a lot down. But overall it was an OK stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1888,Very Enjoyable Family Place To Stay.,50,April 2013,"My family and I stayed at The Haven suites in April 2013 and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The suite was very clean, spacious and quite modern. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The gardens and pools were beautifully maintained. The buffet breakfasts were wonderful.

1891,Nice modern rooms,40,September 2012,We stayed here last year with 3 young children as we did not want to stay in a villa where there are no pool fences. We had a 2 bedroom room. It consisted of one room with ensuite and lounge/ kitchen/ dining room and another room with ensuite and 2 single beds (+adjoining door). We found the room very modern and well appointed with marble bathrooms. it was also very clean. This place was very centrally located. You could go out the front entrance and be right on the street or go out the back entrance and walk to the beach. Our kids loved the pools (choice of 2). The only flaw I found in this place was the balcony did not feel that safe. The railings go horizontal and are easy to climb for young kids and being the the 3 rd floor was a bit dangerous. We just pretended that we had no balcony and did not go out there at all..Staff were all very friendly and welcoming too. Would recommend!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1892,Central location but hotel rooms near the entrance are noisy,30,April 2013,"This was my second stay at the hotel. The first time we had a suite room which had a big balcony over looking a quiet pool area. This time round we stayed in the hotel room which was sparsely decorated, one king size bed. side tables and desk with a upright chair. My main problem with the room was that it was very noisy. The room was facing the pool and situated quite close to the lobby. In the middle of the night we could hear people talking as they make their way back to their rooms and you can forget about sleeping in if someone decides to go swimming at 7am in the morning. The management was nice enough to move us to the suite the next day which made it a little better. My advice is that if you are used to staying in 5 stars accommodation, book either the suite or villa.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1893,Nice hotel but a few flaws,30,March 2013,"This was my second stay at The Haven and I was not as impressed on this stay as i was the last time i visited.

Pros:
- rooms are spacious and inviting, we stayed in the suites however hotel rooms are a reasonable size for a couple of nights stay
- very comfortable beds and pillows
- great tranquil gardens & pools
- beach club access is a unique feature
- turn down service in the evenings is a nice touch
- breakfast buffet is plentiful- they do a lovely eggwhite omelette and the Papaya is always fresh
- in good proximity to shopping & very close to jalan double six restaurants, a short taxi ride to cafes/restaurants/shopping in the heart of seminyak.

Cons:

- there is wifi internet however the signal is slow and drops out all the time and every 3 days you need to obtain a new login & password. Every time i needed to use the wifi I had to keep logging in with the password - this is really annoying particularly for those guests that work whilst travelling or call home via the internet. I was trying to sort out an important banking issue & my calls kept dropping out requiring me to constantly re-enter the login code & password.

- no powerpoint in the bathroom for shavers/straighteners, used powerpoints in bedroom but there is no mirror in the bedroom. - doh!

- i wanted to take a slice of bread & a yoghurt from the buffet at the end of having my breakfast so my husband, who was ill and unable to come to the buffet could have something to munch on. I was embarrassingly told by staff at the buffet that i couldn't take it. I was really upset with this. As part of the room rate we paid for breakfast for 2 persons. i was made to feel like a thief and thought this was a really silly rule. They ask you for your room number, you are entitled to breakfast as a guest - whether you decide to take some breakfast items to your room or eat with all the other guests should be your choice when you are paying $150+ per room. If i was taking a huge plate of food or several plates then i think it would've been called for, but for a piece of bread & 1 tub of yoghurt i think it should be acceptable.

- aircon in rooms are really weak
- aircon leaked constantly in the bedroom, I advised the staff several times of this issue and each time they sent maintenance staff to the room who did nothing more than mop up the water and advise us the aircon unit was fixed. My husband slipped on the leaking water and it took them 4 visits to finally provide us with a mat that we could put on the floor. This all could have been resolved in the first visit when i asked for a mat for the floor in the first place.

- bathrooms have a frosted/clear glass screen that separate the bathroom from the bedroom which, when staying with friends/family, makes it a little awkward to go to the bathroom or have a shower - anyone you are sharing the room with can't really walk into the bedroom without seeing you naked in the shower or sitting on the toilet...not such a private feature!

- there is a kitchen in the suite rooms, equip with wine glasses and even bottles of wine & beer available in the mini bar however no bottle opener.

In conclusion, its the wifi access that has made my decision to not stay here again. I travel alot and rely on a good, easy connection to work while i travel. and being told off at the buffet breakfast wasn't cool.

This is an ok hotel for a night or 2. & for the price per night there are better options in seminyak for a longer stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

1895,"You might be lucky, but maybe not....",20,April 2013,"I stayed at the Haven late in 2012 for 2 nights and couldn't complain about the room or the service. Based on that experience I booked a single night stay at the Haven for my daughter and partner for April 2013 and they had a terrible experience.

On their arrival at the Haven they were informed by reception that they had been allocated an upgrade however the room wasn't yet available which, given that it was mid-morning, did not surprise them. They went to do a little shopping and returned early afternoon to be told that there was no room upgrade and that reception had no knowledge of what they had been told only a few hours earlier. My daughter did not expect an upgrade when she first arrived and would have been happy with the standard room booking but if your going to promise something then stand behind it and actually deliver.

A little annoyed at the change they went to their room and initially everything seemed OK. After around an hour they found the room temperature had only come down 2-3 degrees so they contacted reception and asked for the problem to be addressed. Reception sent an 'engineer' to their room who made some adjustments and said he would go to the 'external part' of the system. He informed them that it would take around 20 minutes for the room to cool down. After a further hour the room was no cooler so they contacted reception again to be told the engineer would come to their room, which he did and then told them he would go check the external part of the system (again). After a further 2 hours the room was no cooler and as they headed out to dinner they informed reception that the room was no cooler and requested, if it couldn't be fixed, to please reallocate them to another room. On return from dinner they checked with reception and were informed that that the problem had been fixed. When they got to the room they found it to be maybe 2 degrees cooler (around 25 degrees). At this stage tired and frustrated they gave up and tried to get what little sleep they could.

The next morning they booked out and asked about the Departure Lounge which according to the Haven advertising is an area for guests to relax and have use of facilities between hotel room checkout and going to the airport. As my daughter had a late evening flight this had been another factor in choosing the Haven for their stay. At no stage does the advertising indicate that a charge is applicable however my daughter was informed that use of these facilities come at a US$50 cost (US$25 per person). By this time completely disillusioned with the Haven facilities and service, they naturally refused to pay anymore and made arrangements elsewhere for the day.

Of our two experiences at the Haven the only common feature we both agreed was good were the breakfast facilities and selection.

Overall my view is that you may be lucky if you stay at the Haven but there are many other hotels that can be relied on to have similar or better accommodation plus a level of service that far exceeds that of the Haven staff. Even though my stay in late 2012 was completely acceptable I won't bother going there again as I have absolutely no confidence that this experience will be repeated. My recommendation is that the Haven be avoided.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1896,"5th Visit to Bali, and this was the WORST Place I Have Stayed",10,March 2013,"After staying at Rama, in Kuta, and Rumuh Bed and Breakfast in Nasa Dua for about the same price. I have to say that this place sucked.. I don't understand the other comments saying its wonderful, its simply below average for a Bali Holiday. Its a concrete jungle of noise, small rooms, hard beds, and a crappy pool surrounded by yet again concrete. Is this how you want to spend you Bali Holiday, looking from a dirty metal crate from your balcony to the noisy hotel atmosphere, or swimming in a pool surrounded by concrete views?

You are in Bali! Views, good service, large roaming resorts for the same price if not cheaper are at your disposal! This place is just sub-standard. I frequently review in Bali, and this was simply the worst place I have stayed out of about 5 visits and many, many better places of accommodation.

On arrival to my hotel I was told quite sternly that ""Even though you booked 3 months prior, Agoda clearly says special requests not taken"", which meant for myself and my girlfriend we had the luxury of staying in separate single beds even though we booked 3 months prior... Are you serious? I'm sure they just made up that excuse, which was even more insulting. The special request is when you ask for single beds!!! You don't request to have a double bed. ""Oh, partners usually sleep in separate beds, its a request if you want to sleep together, and a luxury at Haven Seminyak""..

Anyway, fortunately for me I got Bali Belly while staying here and needless to say some of those maids would have quit on the spot after seeing my room, sheets, and toilet.. haha

Also glass windows, and a toilet one step away from your bed is really not cool. Lucky we had single beds! Thanks Haven!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1897,"Brilliant hotel, friendly staff and great location",50,September 2012,"My dad and I shared a twin room for 4 nights and we were lucky enough to have a room right in front of the pool! So we could wake up in the morning and go for a swim and stroll right back into our room before heading up to the bustling restaurant for breakfast.
Breakfast was amazing to say the least with a huge selection of fruits, cereals, juices, cold meats and cheeses and also a chef cooking you hot breakfasts to order.
There is also a complimentary shuttle bus that will take you down to the beach where there are reserved lounge chairs for resort guests.
Rooms were serviced daily and very clean and also have DVD players for those lazy nights when you don't feel like heading out on the town. Be careful with the air-con as it is very strong and will cool the room down almost too cool.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1898,What a surprise,50,April 2013,"We booked this place online. On arrival, we were upgraded to a suite and were very impressed with this hotel. The staff were super friendly, the room was immaculate, the breakfast was sensational - waffles, eggs, pancakes all made to order. The location is right in the middle of the shopping strip with lots of great restaurants, shopping, money exchange at a good rate. We had a great time here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1899,loved it!!!,50,June 2012,"We stayed at The Haven June 2012, got a great deal and totally loved it.

On arrival it was a breeze no dramas straight to our gorgeous room. We had a standard room and preferred that over any of the others as it was right at the front of the hotel. Had a pool view. Modern rooms. Dont expect a bath thought,( we didnt, but I see other reviewers did)

Probably the first thing we noticed when going into the room was not alot of privacy in the toilet/bathroom but we made a joke of it but it was not a big deal, as long as you didnt look in the mirror, (whilst you were in the room) which was in the bathroom so no real problem at all.

Pool was nice but no swim up bar or anything like that just lazing around but you could order if you wished.

Alot of reviewers say about the loud band in the restaurant but this was no way a problem! Not really sure why that would be a problem as it wasnt so loud where we were, ( I think our room was 2007) great!!! Wifi good too free!

Breakfast was to die for was glorious,ok yes it was bascially the same every day but omg they had so much of it and to look out onto the street was fab! I cant really see why anyone could complain about the breakfast how much do you really need to eat!!

Close to beach if you like to walk not too far, but mainly cab it if you dont really want to walk in the humidity, cheap ride there though.

Cannot say anything bad about The Haven, totally loved it!!!! we were just about the book it again when we decided last minute to go to another place in Seminyak...stay tuned....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1900,stayed over easter break,40,March 2013,"We stayed in hotel (really wished we had booked villa or suite they look amazing).
Breakfast is great egg station , pancake and waffle station are a must.

Hotel Staff are friendly ,
arrived back to hotel on husband birthday and they had left birthday cake and on check out wished him a happy birthday

The only problem we had was every afternoon we were locked out of our room so had to keep going to lobby to get them to redo the room keys.

The room was a little bit of a let down - the floors where dirty , mold in shower",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1901,Great start but terrible ending. Could have been better!,30,April 2013,"Visited Bali with my wife & our 3month old baby. We were given a suite at room 216. As requested a baby cot was also provided for. Despite the flight of stairs & the distance to the room, the ambience there was good. Even the slippers had a personalised touch & actually fit me. We were happy with The Haven. The next day we realised that it would be impossible to shower our baby in the rain shower & there was no tub or pail available. Called reception & was told they have no solution to our situation. Breakfast seemed catered for the European & relatively the same everyday. Over the night we tot it wld be strange that there was no room with a bathtub in The Haven, so I called the reception to request for a room with a tub. Though peeved they didn't suggest it was happy they accommodated the request. Boy was I mistaken, it was like from heaven to hell when we were move to room 4012. Even the slippers were different & didn't fit my size. Overall, I think it's ok to stay here but they really need to improve on their service quality. Staff here simply work on Standard operational procedures & can't think on their feet. Sigh!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1902,First Time Bali Trippers,30,March 2013,"On arrival the Reception staff were very rude and not helpful at all, after any flight this is the last thing you want. Asked for a later check out from 1pm to 6pm was told this will cost me $165US - please. Had two more dealing with Reception staff and again on both times very rude and not interested in helping. Had to wait for over 2hrs to get someone to open our safe as it broke, lucky we didnt have any medication in there.

When ckecking out my receipt was my room number, my surname and what we purchased but the first name and address were not mine, so who knows who got my details.

Interesting that our transfer ride to the airport the staff member for that company even said that they find the reception staff very rude and not helpful, he was running a few minutes late to collect us and he called the Hotel, he was rudely told that they had no guest under our name, when he said we are leaving today again was told that we never stayed there.

All the other staff were brilliant, all happy very friendly, always spoke when you walked past them and they couldnt do enough for you.
Breakfast was disappointing, I have been to Patong numerous times and the breakfasts there are huge and full one, here was very basic and not a good choice.

Overall, room was good but fridge didnt get cold at all, hotel pools very good and again all other staff were fantastic, would I stay here again NO.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1903,Naturally Elegant but Lost its Soul,20,March 2013,"This hotel has a Natural Theme, started from the Lobby. The hotel itself has 2 Entry point, from the Main road and the other is for the Lobby suites.

We will see the Coffee shop first then the Lobby. The coffee shop itself I found quite noisy, not only it is exposed to the Main road (so much) but also its Radio has that lousy volume.

The lobby is simple with a straight view to the Pool and Rooms. I got my room upgraded to Suite, unfortunately, I felt the services was quite different from what they gave to me compared to the foreign. After the check-in Process, the staff showed me the way to the Room 'from the miniature' instead taking me there. Well, I thought they were busy anyway.

Along the way to the room, I met some of the staff, I gave them smile and they just passed me like I wasn't there. Geez ... Naturally Elegant staff. But when I asked the security which way to my room, he politely showed me the way, now that's Naturally Bali.

Suite room was best choice, unfortunately, we need to ask the management for the kitchenware. I only have one glass in my room. The bed was the best, very comfort, especially the pillow, it looks so Big but very soft when I used it.

The balcony provide 1 Double bed. Bed... in Balcony, I don't know what to say, is it an art or way to waste space? I found it funny but it just doesn't feel right. There are 2 AC in the room, too bad my AC in the bedroom was not Cooling anything, it doesn't blow a wind. I have to open the door to the living room.

Bathroom was very small even with its big bath tub. Not really convenience to use the show here. There's a small/ slight open-space between the Bedroom and the Bathroom, because the bed & bath separated by a big Glass. Even we close the door, that small space beside the glass are not very good choice for Suite room. They did pretty Feng Shui job by putting a bamboo inside bathroom, unfortunely this small open are the Inconvenience part in the Suit room.

The living room was facilitate by automatic-light. It will dim/ turned off when u left the living room for a while, and it will turned back on when u come back. Haven did a pretty saving here. The carpet, sofa, table, furnitures and tv were designed modernly luxurious. I can spend the whole day here.

Room Service was great. The staff were polite. The food were very tasty, very western taste.

The nightmare is in the Breakfast. The coffee shop concept beside the pool are cool, but the Staff I found were not well trained for an International hotel.

The bbq staff, didn't cooked the meats consistently. I could taste a different taste between one sausage and another sausage, it could be medium rare or well or even too well done. Some of the staff always did greetings to foreign instead of local people who stayed there. I really found very inconvenience. Too bad the manager wasn't around. Staffs didn't regularly check the conditions of the food, drinks nor the dishes. I found the water dispenser were empty and they just laugh to each other rather than doing their job.

Haven were designed Naturally and I found some natural mistakes that need to be fixed right away. Haven was a great choice for anyone who need comfort place to stay with modern design for their room. Too bad, I still found lacks of staff performances.

Haven was Naturally Elegant designed but they lost its soul for the Natural of Bali.

Thanks but Definitely not going BACK ...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1904,"It Was OK However, A Few Niggling Things That Happened...",30,March 2013,"The hotel itself is quite nice and a bit deceiving from the street at how big it is. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a suite so things started well. The room a good size and comfortable and also nice and quiet. The grounds themselves are very nice with two good sized pools to swim in. It appears to be very family oriented. The staff were generally friendly and helpful.

So, what was the problem? Overall, things weren't too bad however, the annoyance was that for a couple of days, housekeeping short changed us on towels which, really shouldn't happen in a hotel of this stature and having to chase this up was a little annoying. Also, the last two nights we were there, the bathroom started get a pungent smell coming up through the drain which, wasn't overly pleasant. One more thing unfortunately was the air conditioner in the room was pretty weak so it took quite a while to cool the room when we returned in the afternoon.

Breakfast was included in the room rate. The food was standard fare. Perhaps one difference was the pancakes, waffles and French toast made to order.

This hotel won the 2012 Travellers Choice Award for Trip Advisor so they must do most things right most of the time. Perhaps a busy time being Easter however, I guess I was expecting more considering its status.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1905,"We love the pool, our room, but service not so impressive",30,March 2013,"We stayed 3 nights at the 2 room suite and we really love the spacious rooms and living room. The big day bed at the balcony was also great. Like many other reviewer mentioned, this suite area was much more quiet compare to the front part of the hotel. We loved the pool so much, not too big but enough and compliment the view from our balcony.

The bathroom area on the room with king bed however became our first complaint. The bathtub configuration was somehow made it difficult for us to go in and out of the bathtub. After one of my kids slipped and bruised her knee, we decided not to use the bathtub anymore and all of us showered in the other room. But what if you dont get the room with standing shower? I tried asking for a rubber mat to prevent slippery and surprisingly, they dont have it. So beware of the bathtub if you are travelling with children and older people.

Breakfast on our 1st and 2nd day were a total mess. Only one person on the egg station and he kept on messing our orders. Asked for omelet and he forgot to make it. Asked for egg's benedict and he put salmon instead of ham in it. Bacon and sausages were great but we couldnt get them ourselves, had to wait for their staff to ration it and put them into our plates. By 9 am, no more rice or porridge, only hard mie goreng. Second day, some problem with the electricity in their breakfast area and their stove and griller were not working properly. Felt so chaotic, if I had to pay for breakfast I would have been very dissapointed.

We tried buying some dinner at the restaurant in front, absolutely not impressed with the taste.
The welcome drinks was a weird mix of orange and basil.

Spa was great but expensive. But i think i will miss their Duo Massage.

Will we go back next time? Not so sure. With so many hotels in Bali within the same price range and facilities, I think we might still be looking for those who could provide better.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1906,Very pleasant stay,30,December 2012,"I stayed at Haven Seminyak last December for 3 Days. The room was so small and dark, there's not enough lighting. But the bed was comfort enough, and there's also a balcony in my room with a comfort sofa.

I stayed at a room that was really far from the reception desk. But the view and the interior through the way from my room to out of the hotel was priceless. U can really feel that u're in Bali.

The pool was not too big but it was splendid. The staffs were very helpful. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to my colleagues since the price is not too high and it's quite comfortable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1907,Great location but not 4 star,20,September 2012,"Just getting around to reviewing The Haven Seminyak as we went in Sept 2012. The location is very convenient and the rooms was quite spacious. Ensuite was nice enough. We could walk everywhere in the village and taxis were not too expensive if we walked to far. Other pluses included friendly reception and restaurant staff and wonderful buffet breakfast to suit most palates. There was alot of staff walking around the hotel and they greet with a smile. They sort of make me feel safe

On the downside, we experienced broken door to pool threatening security and broken electric kettle. They tried to fix the door several times and it finally worked.. We had to ask for a new ketlle when they said they would repair it. We did suggest changing rooms, but nothing was adequate as we wanted a non smoking room.

If you don't mind loud music around the pool from 10 am to 10 pm, this is the place for you. If you want an afternoon rest, forget it.. Gym room opened at 7, had limited equipment and was fairly busy. The pool is often in the shade in September but fine if you don't mind it cool water. It may get warmer at other times.

You can find cheap and wonderful massage places along the main and back streets. We went often. The hotel will organise tours in SUV with English speaking guides. We took one to Taneh Marah Temple for the sunset viewing. Well worth the trip.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1908,Great location,50,March 2013,"Stayed for 2 nights, the hotel is located centrally, very lively,it was perfect, beautiful spacious, peaceful rooms, friendly staff, great restaurant located right in the front, sat there for hours, just watching people and enjoying the drinks, loved it!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1909,Great escape in Seminyak,50,March 2013,"We stayed at The Haven for two nights. The first thing that strikes you is the transition from the noisy, dirty streets to the quiet, peaceful rooms. We got lucky and were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite. It was spacious, comfortable, and clean. The staff at the front desk were very helpful with directions. Included breakfast was great - huge variety, healthy food, local and western, great service. The location is also very good - close enough to Kuta and Legian without being too crowded and touristy. I would definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1910,Pleasant stay.,50,March 2013,"I stayed at one bedroom suite, room 215 from 20 to 22 March 2013. Huge room, big living room and bedroom with a big balcony. Room was clean and tidy. Adequate lightings around the room so it wasnt dim/dark at night.

There were 3 areas/blocks in the hotel. Near to the lobby area is the normal rooms (think so), next was the villas and finally was the suites.

2 pools, one at the first block and one at my block. Beautiful pool but because they planted frangipani trees ard the pool. White powdery stuff keep falling into the pool and inaddition to this pool was really dirty as well. Try diving into the pool and you will know what I mean. Very disapppointed with this.

There was alot of staff walking around the hotel and they greet with a smile. They sort of make me feel safe as my block was the furthest in.

Breakfast was superb. First time I see a waffle and pancake making station inaddition to the egg and a station for freshly cooked bacon, susage, fish, beef, chix fillet!!

No complains except the pool near the suite block. It was a pleasant stay.

Spa was super expensive though, think the massage starts frim USD40!!!

Dining ecommendation at Seminyak : Try Warung Wahaha for their pork ribs. Travelling by taxi cost abt Rp12-15k.

Try Sardine, their food is really great.

Try Sundari Spa, good massage at a slightly more expensive price but was totally worth it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1911,A little disappointed,30,February 2013,"Stayed 5 nights, great location, rooms not overly large but are comfortable. Air con inefficient, set at 18 apparently but was definitely around the mid 20s, requested that it be lowered, however no action was taken. Booked a quiet room but they attempted to give us a room at the front, which we refused. Booking in is a slow procedure, this large resort is all about turn over not personal service, although for $100 a night you won't get it. Breakfast great as were the swimming pools.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1912,Not overly impressed...,30,February 2013,"We stayed at the Haven in a 2 bedroom suite only 2 weeks ago.I have stayed before last year and quite liked the suites,spacious and well appointed. Before we arrived I organised with the hotel to have a microwave in the kitchen and to have 2 single beds put in the second bedroom. We arrived to our room to find 2 king beds and no microwave? They couldn't move us so we had to make do.
Because of this our toddler had to sleep between us in our bed which put a dampener on our holiday. We received a welcome drink voucher when we arrived, so after trying to redeem it we were told its just orange juice! breakfast was always very good and the staff at the suites end for breakfast were great.
Overall, it was an OK holiday but I don't think we would stay here again. Plenty of great hotels by the beach for the same price.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1913,Best value for money..,50,March 2013,"We decided to stay here last minute for a couple of nights on our travels..$65.00 a night incl breakfast, rooms were lovely and clean, bathrooms awesome, our room was bottom floor next to pool, beautiful outlook, staff are all lovely, such a great price for the quality of room and surroundings, also the gym is small but amazing... The spa is a bit pricey, but there are plenty outside the complex for $5.00 for an hour massage, and were excellent... Def will stay here again our our stops exploring south east Asia.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1914,The villas are spectacular !!!,50,March 2013,"We stayed in a villa this holiday and I must say it will be hard to go back to a normal room. The hotel is great. Clean and tidy. Great breakfast that keeps you goi g all day. Central to everywhere on foot! The actual villa is amazing. Own pool, inside and outdoor showers (both hot), sunken bath for two, king bed, sun loungers and to top it off a sensor toilet! You come home at night ant the bed is turned down, curtains closed and the dimmed lights are on. Very romantic. Will definitely be hard to leave, and will definitely be easy to come back.

I do understand the reviews about noise. The resort is quite noisy in general, but the villas are quiet, and the general noise did not bother us at all.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1915,the best place in bali,50,July 2012,"loved this place and will be going back in July
Breakfast is great and you can sit and eat and watch everyone go by
Pools are big and clean and situated in great spot to walk or taxi anywhere
Rooms kept clean and prices great and staff get to know you and always smiling Thanks",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1916,Disappointment,10,March 2013,Very noisy hotel and extremely rude gentlemen at front desk when we checked in. Have stayed here numerous times before and therefore requested a quiet room - we were allocated room 2001 possibly the noisiest room in the entire place,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1917,GREAT LOCATION!,40,January 2013,"Loved staying here, fantastic location so close to all our favorite shops. The rooms were clean comfortable and the staff were lovely. The buffet breakfast was amazing! We stayed there for 11 nights, which was a bit long for a hotel suite room (small size)& rained 6 of the days but we still enjoyed our holiday all the same.

loved the fact it had a DVD player in the room, we really gave it a work out. The best thing was going over the road to buy $1 video and watching them while it rained so much!

The pool area is great, on the days there was sunshine, we were down by the pool area loving it! The gym was great also, we were happy to get there early as it was very popular and only had a few machines. The machines were great and brand new so the facilities were perfect!

One thing to note, if you only have a DIRECT DEBIT credit card you cant have a mini bar service, we still were able to order the room service but just paid cash on arrival which suited us fine.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1918,"Clean, Comfortable and Convenient Location",40,February 2013,"This was my 5th time to Bali and I was recommended this hotel by a friend. It is a great hotel for the price, there is two really nice pools, great staff, rooms are clean, and the daily breakfast good as well. The location is very central to get into Seminyak, but also to Legian, Kuta and the Airport. Its not directly near the beach, but a close scooter ride away. I would recommend this for people who don't want to spend more then $100/night but want the luxuries of a nice hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1919,Am lovin' it,40,February 2013,"If you like walking down the street along seminyak road, stop by from one shop to another. Not as crowd as in Kuta road. This hotel is perfect!

My most recent stay at February 20 - 22, 2013

The room I stayed in: Suite Room (1 bedroom with livingroom)

What do I have to say about the hotel?

Location: 8.5/10
I think the location is pretty good since it's located in Kuta Legian where the crowd is at in Bali. But for some people, this place is getting increasingly more crowded, hence, some people choose not to stay at this area.

Rooms: 9/10
The room is quite big especially the living room area (if you book the unit with a livingroom). It's clean, tidy, and comfortable. The living room has flat TV with cable and dining area and also a clean kitchen with a fridge. Interestingly, the bathroom in my room didn't have any curtain and you can see through inside if you peek through the patterned-shade glass window. The room also has balcony along the window and it's pretty wide and spacey therefore you can hangout at the balcony in the morning.

Facility: 9.5/10
This hotel has facilities such as FREE wi-fi service even in every room, quite big swimming pools, 2 lobbies and reception area (at the front and at the back), cozy restaurants and bar area. The hotel is located in a long rectangular area and hence it's a pretty long hotel if you walk from the front to the back of the hotel, but the layout is not very wide.

Hotel Staff: 10/10
Like usual in Bali, the hotel staffs are very friendly and pretty helpful in attending to all your needs.

Would I recommend this hotel to others?
Absolutely YES. I would even like to come back here to stay next time I am in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1921,How Good is This!,50,February 2013,"Nine days holiday in Bali staying at The Haven at Semenyak which is just up the road from Kuta.
Excellent location for shopping and just a short walk to the beach and several good value beachside restaurants.
Semenyak seems to be slightly more ""up market"" than Kuta so probably a better area to stay if you are not into the night club or back packer scene (not that there is anything wrong with that!).
Everything in the hotel absolutely spotless from the rooms to the public areas to the beautifully manicured grounds.
All staff very friendly and helpful.
Great breakfast in an amazing pool garden setting.
Rooms spacious and very well appointed, free Wi-fi.
Free afternoon tea including drinks each day from 4 -6 PM.
Will definitely stay here next trip to Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1922,Great location,40,February 2013,"Stayed twice now, first time (December 8-10) got upgraded - lovely spacious room/clean with balcony. Second time in standard room, same quality, only a fraction smaller. Staff fantastic. Great breakfast - the lot eggs, bacon, sausages, fruit, yogurt, cereal, pancakes and waffles, muffins, bread, croissants, tomatoes etc... oh they even have fried rice or noodles and thick wedges and veges. Two pool areas and two dining areas. Because it is such a large complex it doesnt feel too overcrowded.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1923,Awesome,50,February 2013,"Was here for one night and made a random booking through Expedia. Was very doubtful when I made a booking. But guess what all my fears were laid to rest the moment I entered the hotel. Great location, right in midst of the all the shops, courteous staff who went out of their way to help me. Great rooms and service, everything just felt top class. Even had Dinner at their restaurant small portions but absolutely lip smacking.
On the whole had a great experience at this hotel and Special thanks to Dewa, One trainee and Putra at the reception who helped with all my queries and questions",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1924,Cool and sweet!,40,October 2012,"Very sweet and accommodating FDO. This unique hotel surprised us with a honeymoon cake. so sweet of them!

Their outdoor swimming pool is fantastic!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1925,Nice ambience and Pools,40,January 2013,"Stayed at the Haven during a recent trip to Bali. Overall service was decent. Had a couple of issues with non-availability of bed typed even though booking was done earlier and confirmed.
Plus the air conditioning was not working properly in the first night. Management got the room changed the next day after 3 complaints. Breakfast was a nice spread and staff was very attentive and friendly. Overall satisfactory experience apart from a couple of issues",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1926,Nice rooms and pool,40,February 2013,"Staff and receptionist were very helpful. Upon checking in, we were offered an upgrade so we can stay in two rooms that are connected. It wasn't a free upgrade but it was affordable and we get to have a lounge and kitchen from it. Lounge was spacious and clean.

There was only one incident that made our stay less enjoyable. On our first morning, my sister and father went to get their breakfast. My father was told off from wearing hotel slippers outside the rooms. But they let him through because he didn't know of said rule. There were no signs on the room saying that we couldn't wear the slippers outside the room. However, there was a sign saying we couldn't wear them for breakfast, right outside the restaurant.. My sister also grabbed a croissant thinking she can eat it on the way back to her room since we were in a hurry. A staff asked her to put back the croissant as taking food back into the room was not allowed! Poor croissant had to be tossed out (I hope) so they rather have the food tossed out than eaten by paying guests?

Oddly, my Mum who missed out on the breakfast, was offered 'take-away' breakfast on her way out of the hotel. What the? Please be consistent with your service and your policies. Maybe my sister and father just had a grumpy staff, but this still doesn't reflect good on the hotel.

Location was convenient and we can literally walk out and be in the heart of the shopping area in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1927,Serene and well located,40,February 2013,"We actually got off to a bad start. Firstly we checked in way to early and they wouldn't give us our room not one minute before 3pm, that was ok our mistake. We tried to catch up on some sleep around the pool but between the pool boy bouncing the ball 2 feet from my head and playing the best of Barry Maniloe very loud it was never going to happen. I did ask him to quieten down but fell on deaf ears. We got into our room and after 3 hours realised our fridge was not cooling down as was the air conditioner. We asked them to fix both and this was immediately attended to. But a further few hours the aircon did not work and our room was a steamy 28degrees at 2.30am in the morning. After negotiating an upgrade to the suites then our holiday commenced.The standard rooms are really quite lovely but its a little noisy, between the motor bikes, the roosters and music its prob not for everyone. Highly recommend the suites and the superior rooms. Even the pool is nicer. The staff are very accommodating, the rooms are well serviced. I would stay there again but would love to experience the villas, they look amazing and reasonable priced. The wifi was a bit of a nuisance it kept kicking you off every few minutes. Great location and good shopping and restaurants all around.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1928,Great Hotel,40,February 2013,We stayed here for 8 days on our honeymoon and loved it. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite on the third floor and we had no problems with noise at all. All the staff were lovely. So polite and friendly. The grounds are beautiful. The food in both restaurants was really yummy and not too badly priced. We enjoyed sitting in the front of the Sabeen restaurant and just watching the traffic and tourists. It is close to everything you need and tours can be booked through the guys at the travel desk. We will definitely be coming back here to stay next time we come to Bali.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1929,Highly Recommended - Perfect all round!,50,February 2013,"The Haven Seminyak was fantastic in all categories - cleanliness, quality, service, food, location & price. We (2 couples) stayed here for 3 nights after 5 nights at Jimbaran and The Haven was our favourite hotel by far! I was 27 weeks pregnant when we visited from Australia and was advised by the staff they only use spring water in their kitchen, drinks and ice... that took away my fear of ""Bali belly"". That's the last thing you want on holidays, especially in a foreign country whilst pregnant. Their food was fantastic, we ate in the Sabeen restaurant every night (whilst being enteratined by great live bands)... I recommend their Atlantic Grilled Salmon ($7.50au) and their Sabeen Mint Tonic mocktail... I enjoyed these every night. Highly recommended place to stay. PS. If you need a great driver to escort you around Bali - ask for Norman at the front desk.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1930,Best choice,50,January 2013,"I will be going back to this hotel!!! It's close to the shops and most importantly a convenience store in front of it.
I love the staff there, they are very kind and will try to give help as much as possible.
The pool was the best part in the hotel :)
The down side is you have to reconnect to the wifi all the time and Mosquitos in the computer lobby. Otherwise everything is great :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1931,February 3rd-9th 2013,50,February 2013,"Loved staying here in February, weather was perfect. Air con was amazing. Staff were so friendly and always helpful. I'd live there if I could. Can't wait to go back next year. Love it, recommended for everyone. I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor, loved it so much, beautiful view.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1932,Great service,40,February 2013,"The hotel is located at the heart of Semiyak. During our stay of 2 nights, we upgraded to the suite room. Staff are friendly especially Mr Adi, Very warm and welcoming. When we requested for an adaptor on the first day, it was not available so please do bring your own adaptors. On the second day, the counter staff were extra helpful with our request. Kudos to the housekeeper who went the extra mile just to help us. Breakfast is simple and reasonable.

Overall, service is fantastic. Staff are pleasant and relax. Would definately recomend this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1933,Excellent location & good room :),30,February 2013,"The Haven Seminyak seems to be modern hotel in the middle of the busy Seminyak. The price are reasonable. The room is spacious. Love the bathroom too. AC is working very well.
The (-) : This place is way too noisy because of the sound from the homeband of the restaurant itself. Is it just me or the music won't stop from the morning until in the night time? For nap time lovers or you want to sleep early maybe this one will annoying you unless you sleep like a dead person :)

BUT so far the room is nice, lovely, comfortable! :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1934,"We will be back, highly recommended",50,February 2013,"This is our 5th trip to Bali, we have stayed at different hotels each time with different results, but for the price we paid the Haven ticks all the right boxes for us, Check in went smoothly, porter and reception very helpful and friendly, as were all the staff, They have 3 types of accommodation that you can choose from, Hotel, villa and suites, we stayed in a hotel room, and yes it can be a bit noisey, but hey your on Bali and in the middle of seminyak what can expect?? If you want piece and quite and no traffice stay in Udud, yes there is live music in the restaurant on most nights, but again it was always over at 10- 10.30 pm, the rooms were nice and clean, nice comfortable bed and the best pillows I have ever found in a hotel, the buffet brealfast was great, everything one could ask for and more, the staff in Sabeen restaurant are fantastic, Ayu and Nia are always smiling and happy to help, the Friday BBQ was fantastic. Sitting in the front of the restaurant over looking the street of an evening with a cocktail relaxing and watching the world go by was great, yes the prices are a bit high, but it is a four star hotel and not a warung on the street. On our next trip to Bali we won't waste our time seaching for another hotel, we'll be straight back to the haven, Highly recommend",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1935,Perfect holiday at ideal hotel,50,January 2013,"I was so worried before the trip because I was responsible for choosing a hotel not only for me and my husband, but also for other 4 ppl in our group. I didn't want to spoil other ppl's holidays, so I read all reviews of about 50 hotels. And gosh I am so happy I ended up choosing this hotel. Everything was just perfect!

My Mum and my Gran, 2 of my nieces, my husband and me, we all were so happy with our rooms - they upgraded our rooms to suites for free and it was a perfect start of our holiday.

Breakfast was real good. Location is great. Beach club was very nice too. But most of all – the stuff – they all were just nice, helpful, and responded fast to any request.

And the departure lounge was a perfect ending. Actually I never saw a departure lounge in other hotels and we all found it very useful. I will definitely stay there again. We all just loved it",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1936,Very noisy. Poorly maintained bathroom,20,February 2013,"Boy where do I begin. Tonight is my second night here and I am really dreading the rest of my stay. I would've actually moved to a different hotel if I didn't book a non-refundabel 7 night stay. This is definitely not a 4-star hotel. 

Bad:
Noise - There's no escape from the noise. I requested moving to a different room because I was so close to the restaurant and the live music was very loud. The front desk was very friendly and moved me all the way to the opposite side. However, I can still hear the music very clearly, and now I also get all the noise from the rowdy crowd at the pool. All the reviews about thin walls are true. I can hear everything in the next room. Basically you get noise from restaurant, pool, construction next door, roosters all morning starting before 7am. Depending on where your room is, you might also hear the loud music from the restaurant across the street that plays well after 10pm. 

Shower - the shower has a funky moldy smell. The shower door doesn't block any water from leaking out. So if you don't place a towel on the floor outside the door, prepare for big water puddle on bathroom floor. In fact, I think even the the bottom of the glass wall is leaking because trash can right next to the shower stall also has a puddle of water underneath. 

In room wifi - there isn't one really. Most of the time my devices cannot even see the wifi network. When I can connect, the connection is slower than a dialup and it would get dropped very 2 minutes. I stopped trying to use it at all and just use the 3G on my local SIM card. 

Good:
Staff is friendly - front desk is nice and helpful. Just about everyone I run into is nice and friendly with a smile
Location - it has quite a few restaurants nearby and is pretty central to everything. 
Breakfast -  breakfast is good with decent selection of pastry",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1937,Happy & enjoy....will going back if.....,40,February 2013,"Me and my wife stayed there for 5 nights (Feb 2013) and got the Haven Room. I got the Last Minutes Deal and it was a really cheap one (50% discount). Anyway, there are pros & cons that I want to share:

* Great location. It is a 10-15 minutes walk to Double Six Beach. A lot of kiosk, cafes & restaurants in surrounding. There is a 24 hours mini market just in front of the hotel. Also, you'll find it easy to get a taxi (especially Blue Bird taxi).
* Great breakfast. Not so many choices but the taste was great. Careful with flies. Some were all over the food. Also, if you want to find a table or sit, just coming right in. Don't get fool with the sign which tells you to wait to be seated. There were no servants coming or help you. I had to stand almost 5-7 minutes to get seated.
* The room was very clean and the bed was so comfy. If possible, ask for the room at the back of the hotel. It is more quite.
* The bathroom was clean but to bad it uses glass wall (see-through glass). No privacy at all if you stay with friends.
* Love the amenities (you'll get everything you need). But check again after they make up your room. My coffee cup and spoon was still dirty.
* Staffs are friendly and helpful, but some will treat you differently if you are a local tourist.
* Love the restaurant (café). Excellent place to hangout until 2 AM. Beware, if you are a local tourist, several servants will treat you differently. If you are a foreigner, you will be treated as a king or queen. Even they will let you bring and eat (or drink) from outside.
* I got pick up ride from the airport (the driver was friendly), late check out (2 PM) and others from the Last Minute Deal. It was an excellent deal.
* I hadn't try the swimming pool. But it looks great and tempting.

In summary, I was very happy and enjoy my stay. I will going back to this hotel if they improve the quality of staffs, services or there are any interesting packages or deals. In normal price, it is a bit expensive. Once again, careful if you are a local or domestic tourist. This hotel is not friendly with you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1938,the location!!!,40,November 2012,"I stayed in a one bed room suite, and it was very nice. You walk in far from the crowded street so even though it's in the heart of the main street, it is not noisy at all. The rooms were very clean and spacious. The bathroom with the rainshower was very nice and had a huge day bed on the balcony. quite good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1939,Mix of buzz & tranquilityl,40,January 2013,"Convenient location, good breakfast, proximity to beach and market is what makes this property truly unique.
After reading positive reviews about this hotel on tripadvisor, we had no doubts to go ahead with bookings and trust me every single penny worth.
Rooms were of decent size with on-house mini bar and TV. You can select villas if your budget allows for unique experience. There are lots of good eating options around the hotel.
If you looking for pulse of city and tranquility of sea then this could be your perfect choice. My rating would be 8/10.

Important tip: Bali is a place to show your Superb negotiation skills. Don't offer anything more than 50% of quoted price. HapPy vacations!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1940,the pool was the best part of the stay,40,January 2013,"We stayed for a week and had ok service... The staff can be rude at times on the front desk. Originally we had booked in a haven room but it was really small and was right at the back of the hotel and luckily they gave us an upgrade!

This was the second time we stayed there and if it wasn't for its location and the fact that the pool is great we wouldn't stay again.... Disappointing for the price I paid",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1941,"Nice Hotel , good location",40,January 2013,"Staff are very friendly, location of hotel is good, although we didn t know until last day that lagian area is just behind our hotel, but the A.C. Of my room was not good at all, breakfast is good, prices are good ....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1942,Good location and very friendly staffs,40,January 2013,"Location: Conveniently located along the busy street of Seminyak, surrounded by restaurants, retail shops, spas & convenient stores.
Service: Staffs are very friendly, accommodating and very polite.
Room: first night we were checked into room 3002, so called garden view but it faces the building structures. Could hear the live band from the restaurant very clearly in the room, it was so loud. Next day we were moved to Room 2008 with pool view. Bathroom is filthy & smells, room is ok.
Breakfast: Excellent! Serves a variety of choices, however, they all look the same continuously 3 morning. The hotel serves the same types of fruits every morning, boring.
Overall: This is a pretty modern hotel great for a relaxing short break. I hope to return soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1943,Absolutely Fabulous!,50,November 2012,"From the time of checking-in to the time I departed, my stay at The Haven was just perfect!

The staff couldn't help enough, were all friendly and spoke english fluently.

From house keeping to room service and drinks by the pool..the service was impeccable.

I am recommending The Haven to everyone and I will definitely be staying back there when I return this year.

Fantastic value for money.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1944,Decent Villa,40,January 2013,"Stayed there for 2 nights only, don't know about the hotel or suite, but the villa was decent. it has 2 bedrooms (& bathrooms), 2 swimming pools,1 kitchen, and a nice tubs in each bathrooms. Each bedroom has a flat screen TV (2 in the master bedroom).

Breakfast was okay, lots of variations but tastes average. The hotel and suite also has outdoor swimming pools which can be used by everybody. One odd thing for me is they have no properly placed sunbed besides the hotel swimming pool, all the sunbeds are placed in a spot where there's no sunshine, because the sun is blocked by the walls and trees. So if you want to sunbathe, you just have too roll out a carpet on the grass and lay there instead.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1945,Good central hotel,40,January 2013,"The Haven is quite centrally located to most things in Seminyak, and as we were there in the New year the street outside was constantly jam packed with cars and people, and also very noisy, therefore the hotel was a 'haven' after being out in the thick of it.The hotel complex including the pool, and restaurant, gym and other facilities were very nice. The room itself was just a fairly standard hotel room that was nice enough but needing a little TLC (eg curtains mouldy) and nowhere decent to hang wet clothes after drenching rain. The bed was very comfy and the room quiet, so we slept well. ( after the live music finished, which was loud)
The staff were lovely and always helpful, the breakfast had a huge choice of delicious food, the restaurant at other times was very nice but quite small serves for the price. The laundry and spa were also very expensive so we didn't use these.
In general it's a good central hotel that was very overpriced, as they bumped up their prices alot for New Year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1946,This place is fantastic!,50,January 2013,"I stayed at ""The Haven"" under recommendation from friends, They all have all stayed there for the obvious reasons, Great location, Extremely good value for money, Professional and well trained staff. It certainly lived up to the hype. I definitely will be back to stay here again........Usually I like to move around and not stay in the same hotel twice. Although due to my wonderful experience, I figure...If you are on a good thing stick to it. I would highly recommend the Haven to everyone, the same why everyone has recommended it to me.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1947,Good value,40,January 2013,"I was happy with The Haven, the rooms were comfortable and the staff were quite friendly. The location could have been better, I have stayed at better-located hotels in Bali. While I was impressed with the restaurant and the drinks, check-out was completely ridiculous. I had a late flight and the best they could do was force me into a pay-in lounge that only served finger food for an hour. A poor end to an otherwise very decent stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1948,Will never forget the greatest experienced,50,January 2013,"I planned to stay at haven room with my wife (we just married at jan 12th 2013) but the system upgrade it automatically to Haven Suite Room!! O my God! The suite was amazingly great!!! We surprised...we never had stay at nice place as that before...
Thank you The Haven - Seminyak, you made our honeymoon very special better than we imagine!
The room, serivice and food was great!
Will come back here someday! And of course will recommend to friends and share what we got...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1949,"Not bad unless it rains, which it regularly does in Bali",30,January 2013,"This is a modern and very large hotel complex. The rooms are spacious and nice and there are 2 reasonable pools. I found the service was good but the hotel food was average and over priced. The main problem with this hotel is that it covers a lot of ground and the uncovered walk to some of the rooms is not only really long, but large he posed to the elements. As my visit was during the wet season this meant that I got drenched arriving and departing.

The Hotel is really centrally located and if you can get a good deal on room price and are happy to acct less than the best, then it's not a bad choice.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1950,Must be able to find better value for money,10,January 2013,"We stayed for a few days and stayed quite disappointed. First of all, we had to wait for a few hours for our checkin past way past the 3pm time. Second, we constantly had someone knocking on our door for some service that we did not want or need. This was something we encountered for the first time in our travels (we stayed in Sanur for a few days before coming here and we did not have anyone bothering us). Third, staff seems to be fairly clueless about any requests - have to explain multiple times and very carefully confirm their understanding (again,in Sanur in a similar type of hotel the staff was very easy to talk to). Finally, the loud music - every day in the evening for few hours, we have to sit and listen to the extremely loud live music coming from the restaurant. On that note, if you are actually in the restaurant, it is too loud (louder than being on a concert), if you are in the room, you are unable to really do anything enjoyable (watch tv, for example).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1951,Disappointed,20,December 2012,"We recently stayed here for 5 nights and were very disappointed. We travelled withour 10 month old and stayed ina suite. Our friends had a pool villa. The rooms were very tired and not all that clean. We ordered room service on the first day and when they serviced our room the next day they didn't remove the dirty dishes, we placed them outside our room and they stayed there for another 24 hours. They have a club room where you can have free drinks and canapés between 4 pm and 6 pm. The first time we went, we arrived at 430pm and my husband had 1 beer, when he went up to get another one they said they had run out, we were the only ones there!!!! Another time I arrived at 515pm and they were packing up. The first morning when our suite was serviced, instead of replacing the empty shampoo and conditioner bottles, they put the empty ones back in.
On two occasions when we had the do not disturb sign up as we were trying to settle our daughter, we had service knock on our door, we said not to enter but on both times they did. Once I was in the bathroom when they entered, even with the do not disturb sign on. I wouldn't stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1952,Not what we were looking for!,30,May 2012,"Just one of those trips where you don't really know what to expect!

Stayed at Haven as a part of the flight+hotel package and it turned out be an average stay. The hotel is situated on a busy and noisy street and hence the sound quality was disappointing, considering we landed at night. More disappointing was the check-in which took almost 45 minutes! The start was exhausting and irritating. Same was the case while check-out. The staff was a little considerate and took only 30 minutes or so this time! ;)

The breakfast had limited options for vegetarians and I recall having pastries/muffins 3 out of the 4 days that we stayed there. Though in-room dining and the restaurant had a decent menu, it was certainly over-priced for its preparation & quality. We somehow managed to find a couple of excellent restaurants on the same street and avoided having dinners at the hotel.

The positives were the room and the cleanliness. The housekeeping staff was also very courteous.

Was it worth the money spent? Will I stay there again- May be not.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1953,Brilliant!,40,January 2013,"The Haven was a brilliant place to stay for my first trip and my partners 8th trip to Bali. The staff were very welcoming and helpful in all matters from airport transfers to finding a safe place to get money out. The rooms are very spacious and have a small balcony to sit on to enjoy the rain or sunshine. The breakfasts were always delicious with a range from pancakes and pastries to fried rice or traditional bacon and eggs. The location of the hotel was brilliant with access to shops, taxi's readiy available to take you anywhere you desire and just a short walk to the beach where there are some hotel reserved beds (best to get down early for these).
I would definately stay here again :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1954,Upgrade to suites for Free!!,50,November 2012,"Before, we're planning to stay in this hotel because the location is in the heart of seminyak, near the beach, shops, car rental, have a modern room design, and it's less expensive.
The reality : All of that and plus a good surprises that they turn out to upgraded our haven rooms to suites for free. The suites room are amazing and spacious. The breakfast quite delicious and lots of variety. My son can't stop jumping happily.. It was a great holiday! ..Thank you!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1955,Excellent Location,40,October 2012,"My weekend in this Hotel are amazing , you can access all Seminyak area including all small street in there. Room are comfort , big and clean . U can request a pool access Room in
first floor. Breakfast are amazing with fresh and various choice of bread and pastry .

Wish I can stay again on my next vacation .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1956,Very nice,40,December 2012,"Overall I was very impressed with the hotel. The location was great, rooms were clean but thought they could use a scourer pad instead of just a damp cloth on the kitchen bench tops, staff were very helpful and polite (always said hello), walking distance to the beach (about 500 meters), shops and restaurants everywhere. If you wanted more shops or restaurants as per usual grab a so called ""taksi"". We had breakfast included and couldn't complain about the choice of food, the variety was spot on. Not sure about eating there for dinner as we never had a chance to. Only thing that let it down was the swipe cards to get into our rooms. The cards for some reason weren't activating the sensor on our room doors to open, which then meant we (I) had to walk over to the reception desk to get the cards reactivated. Happened about the first 3 or 4 days, it got very annoying but then they swapped the cards over and all was good from then on. So, would I recommend this hotel or go back to it again? The answer is definitely ""YES"".",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1957,Much better places to stay- air con doesn't work!!!,30,December 2012,"We travelled with another couple to Seminyak over the Christmas period. We had all been to Seminyak before so knew what to expect. Sadly, The Haven did not deliver. I read so many fantastic reviews so perhaps had higher expectations.

The location(borderline Legian) is convenient with everything at your doorstep, and anything that isn't just a short and cheap cab ride away.

Check in was terrible. Our suite was not ready at 3pm, we were double chaged, and our bedding configuration was incorrect despite emails with hotel prior to arrival. Service was not friendly at all.

Ground staff and Housekeeping were great. Polite, friendly and did a great job.

Staff in the restaurants for breakfast etc avoided eye contact and were not friendly. Barely a hello from anyone of a morning. How can there be so many people working that can't say hello!? Or even meet and greet where it states to wait to be seated.

Breakfast however was nice, a great selection including breads, cheese, cold meats, waffles, omelettes etc. Whilst I didn't eat most of this there was plenty for everyone.

The biggest issue of the hotel is the rooms. We paid extra money for the 2 bedroom suite. The rooms look great- yes they have lots of wear and tear, stains in the stone etc, but what hotel doesn't. The air conditioning doesn't work-- if you like sleeping in the heat of Bali without adequate aircon-- this is your place!! We spoke to other couples in the hotel all with the same issues.. Some had their doorways taped up by the hotel to try and help... The Haven needs to invest in some better airconditioning. We couldn't use out lounge dining area that we paid extra for as it was a complete sweat box.

Previously we stayed at The Kayana Villas. These are Amazing Villas with top notch service. Location is great, service is amazing-- yes, they cost a lot more, but I came home relaxed from Bali last time, and this time I returned exhausted and disappointed for terrible nights sleep.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1958,My hot tip for families in Seminyak!,50,December 2012,"My family and I just returned from two weeks in Bali. We decided to stay in Seminyak because it is a little removed from the craziness of Kuta without being as quiet as Ubud. A happy medium, which suited us.

Our travel agent, who is an old friend working at Flight Centre, recommended the Haven Hotel & Suites as a nice, family-friendly place to stay, which ticked all of our requirements boxes (not TOO expensive, classy, close to the beach and walking distance to restaurants and shopping, kid friendly). We were VERY happy with the decision.

Now, we stayed in the Haven Suites, which is part of the same complex as the hotel and the private villas, but has its own lobby and entrance. The suite was better than we expected; really it was a spacious one bedroom apartment. We had a big living/dining area with a kitchenette and a separate bedroom with a big bathroom. The hotel supplied a cot for our 19-month old daughter.

The hotel (by this I mean the entire complex) has four swimming pools including two which are about knee height on an adult, so perfect for littlies. If you like to laze in the sun, it is best to get a spot early, because the pools are in shade for a lot of the day, due to the hotel shadow, and the good spots will go quickly. The pool areas are quite beautiful, with fairy lights at night time.

The staff were exceptionally friendly and quite taken with my blue-eyed, blond-haired daughter. They would go out of their way to wish her a good morning and say hello whenever we walked past. I have been told that past guests have complained about the level of English the staff have, but I did not find this a problem and I know the hotel runs twice-weekly language lessons for the employees. The General Manager is an expat Aussie and really made us feel very welcome - even inviting us to dine with him at one of the hotel's two restaurants, Sabeen. The food there was excellent and a credit to the Head Chef, an expat South African, whom the staff adore.

Breakfast was included in our package and I was never disappointed with the selection. Bali being predominantly Hindu, rather than Muslim, I didn't go without bacon each day. When the hotel is full, it can be tricky to get a table for breakfast, but that is pretty normal.

Internet WiFi was free, although your log-in is only valid for three days; you just have to ask the desk for another code.

Mozzies were a minor annoyance, but it IS a tropical country and we went in the wet season. The hotel fogs for mosquitoes once a week and there was a noticeable decline following each fogging.

The hotel is situated right on the main street in Seminyak, and a short walk to a supermarket called Bintang, where you can get all your supplies. Next to Bintang is a row of ATMs, including a Commonwealth ATM. As I mentioned, it is not far from the beach. We walked, but the hotel does provide a shuttle bus to its private beach area, which has sun lounges and umbrellas and is ony metres away from a bar and the lifesavers pavillion.

We checked out a villa too, and they are absolutely fantastic - waterfalls, private pool, epic bathroom, etc...

We didn't use the spa, but it offers all of the treatments you might expect at a cost you would expect of a hotel.

All in all, we really enjoyed the Haven Suites and will definitely look to return on our next trip to Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1959,Fabulous Beds,40,November 2012,"My husband and I, our 21 year old daughter and my parents (83 and 84) have just returned from staying at the Haven Hotel. Checking in and checking out process is very quick and easy. We got upgraded to a suite room each, which are nice and big. The beds are super comfy and mod cons available, including a reasonable laundry service where your clothes come back smelling divine.Staff are friendly, breakfasts are buffet style with plenty of variety. Quiet and relaxing place to return to after being out in the hectic pace of Bali. Location is good for shopping, resteraunts, massages etc. We didnt get to the beach which is only 10-15 minutes walk away (i believe) mainly due to my parents mobility, but the pools were nice and had relaxing loungers to sit and read on. Overall, pleasant stay with no issues.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1960,We loved The Haven!,40,December 2012,"Friendliest of staff, comfortable beds, huge towels, fantastic breakfast in a hip cafe spot, lovely pool, and terrific location with shops so handy. We found it was very quiet in the room, yet a buzzing, lively atmosphere in their cafe. My 15 yr old daughter loved it, so did I.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1961,Lovely boutique hotel,40,December 2012,"Stayed for 9 nites in deluxe room , rooms are spotless with great bed linen and large white towels, all rooms had a balcony overlooking pool.breakfast was fresh and plentiful with different choices each day , and the Danish pastries baked in-house were delicious.staff were attentive and helpful, really enjoyed our first stay here , have booked a two bedroom suite for next stay, the pool area for the suites has sun most of the day ,where the deluxe room pool is mostly shaded.also checked out the villas, they are really nice , and very private, highly recommend this hotel, it's very close to supermarket and plenty of restaurants in the vicinity. The hotel provides a shuttle for the short trip to the beach where there is a private area with loungers provided for Haven guests.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1962,"Great hotel, great service.",40,December 2012,"I have just come back from 4 days at the hotel with a mate and our sons. We booked it as we wanted a hotel in Seminyak and we all agreed it is a great hotel. Location was spot on in that there is a Cirkle K mini-mart across the road, good massage places, shops and bars nearby. Check-in went smoothly and our bags delivered with the rooms functions and operations clearly explained by the staff member.
Both of the breakfast buffets were good with a good selection of food. The pools were large and well catered for with lounges which surprisingly were easy to get.
We found the service excellent, with any requests acted on promptly with a friendly smile. We were also lucky enough to have a look in one of the 2 bedroom villas they have on site - these are outstanding and priced quite reasonably.at $US458 per night.
We want to make this week-end an annual boys trip to Bali and all agreed we would go back to The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1963,Lovely place not sure if it was for us,40,December 2012,"We stayed 5 nights in a suite just recently. While it was modern and clean it wasn't exactly what we were looking for.
I think the thing that bugged me the most was the lengthy check in, which took over 30 mins. This was on top of an already long, delayed flight with small children. We're not sure why it took so long but there was no offer of drinks or seating while we were waiting. This was not a good start.
Our suite was the closest to the childrens pool which was great to keep an eye on the kids but it was not good for when they carted the breakfast trolley's over the pool bridge, laughed and talked loudly and generally made a noise very early in the morning. It woke all of us up everyday.
When I originally rang to make the booking I was told that the hotel/suites were 450m to the beach, well that is true if you're a bird. They do however offer a 2 hourly tuk tuk service (but it's not always on time). The beach where the loungers are set up is quite nice, a bit quieter than some other places but also a little remote.
The food, drink and service can't be faulted. The kids menus were great and the house keeping guys very quick and efficient and very friendly.
I certainly would recommend this place to people who didn't want to be near a beach but if you do, look elsewhere.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1964,"Good location, service so-so",30,December 2012,"I'm currently staying in the haven as I write this review. The first day I arrived, it was beautiful, nice clean rooms with good service. However, all the troubles started yesterday, the fridge was not cold, when the technician arrived, he explained that that was the way it was, upon my insistence did he change the fridge and at least the drinks in the fridge are now cold. Then the lights in the room kept flickering and the front desk did not understand what I was trying to say,and kept insisting that I stop taking the card out of the room slot and playing with the switches. Only when the technician arrived did he understand the situation and fix the lights.

At night, there were loud bellows from the lobby from a group from a tour (all dressed in the same yellow polo tee-shirt) and the noise went on late into the night. This morning, the same group of people in the same yellow polo tees were very loud and boisterous as they ate their bfast and moved into the lobby.

In the midst of all the noise from the tour group, my tea was served with a film of oil over it and served in a dirty tea-cup.

I have 2 more nights here and I'm not quite looking forward to it. It's really a shame since this is a really nice establishment in a very good location. Lets hope things get better (quieter)..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1965,Little gem!!!!!,40,November 2012,"I think the Haven has received some undue criticism. I stayed here for 4 nights at the back end of November. I Am amazed it is so far down the list of best hotels in Seminyak. The staff are friendly and very helpful, the breakfast buffet was sound, the rooms were great. Yes, when sitting at the front bar there is noise and traffic going by, that's Bali, come on get a grip, if you want peace and quiet, get to Nusa Dua.. Keep up the good work Haven, I, for one, will be returning....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1966,Great,50,December 2012,"My booking with The Haven was one of those rare lucky coincidences where everything just worked out to my full satisfaction and at a reasonable rate. I had a unit in the suite area which consists of a bedroom and bath, a living room with a pantry and a spacious balcony with a day bed. The interior as well as the garden area are modern and stylish, the offering complete. The place is 3 years old and - from what I could see - in great demand in spite of the slow period around this time of the year. In spite of that, the property shows little wear and tear and it is well maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful. Apart from perhaps the coffee on tap, the breakfast buffet offering should not disappoint even more demanding palates. Also the hotel's location is a plus as one side borders the busy main shopping street of Seminyak and the other one leads out to a side street through which one can access the beach and the bar strip around the Cocoon within a couple of minutes.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1967,Great Value for Money,50,October 2012,"As I travel to Bali regularly , I choose to stay at the The Haven Hotel, Seminyak . It is like my home away from home for the last 3 years . As my main focus in bali is on business, I need a hotel that can deliver on the basics such as good airconditioning, a clean room, strong wifi, laundry being dropped in time and an onsite restaurant that serves good food. I can find all this in the Haven.

I find the hotel to be excellent value for money, and the location extremely handy to everything. But the main reason I keep returning is because of the friendly and professional nature of the Haven's staff.

The Haven staff have a ""can do"" attitude that it always backed up with a smile. Thankyou the Haven team - I will return !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1968,First timers and we loved it.....,40,October 2012,We had our first trip to Bali in October this year. We stayed at The Haven for 4 nights out of 10. We stayed in a Villa and were very impressed with all that it had to offer. Found all service very friendly and breakfast each day was beautiful - I think arriving early was the key!! Our room was serviced twice a day and had all room service requests promptly answered. Great location and we took advantage of the beach shuttle. We would definitely stay here again (can't wait to get back in fact!!!).,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1969,Expect what you get for the price,40,November 2012,"My partner and I stayed here for 9 nights during our stay at Seminyak. When we initially arrived for check in, we were informed that we had to have a twin bed room the first night as they do not have the kind bed room as we originally booked. The employee said sorry but can you stay in a twin bed room and I said.. well if we have too? We did book a kind bed room, and he said that for the first night we will stay there but then move to our kind bed room the next day. There was so compensation offered at all, and then the employee went on to say we will offer you free Wifi as in to say we received it as we were burdened by the room but i mentioned to him that was part of the booking. Him doing this annoyed me,

The next day we had to 'check out' then 'check back in' to our king bed room, This was a pain as we had to pack everything up and they had to look after out luggage then wait until check in time.

What i do not understand is why did they take a booking if they did not have the room available?

The buffet breakfast was not bad, and the pool was nice and the pool workers were very nice. Most staff are very nice and the cleaners are lovely and always greeting us when we would walk out of my room.

I would say overall this was an alright place for the price but i do not think i would stay here again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1970,Here at the moment....,50,November 2012,"I thought I would post this as when I was home I was checking these daily. We checked in yesterday and were upgraded to suites from the hotel (as a lot of people seem to be). The staff are fabulous and very attentive and polite. After checking in we had dinner at Sabeen and the food was second to none - wonderful satay and nasi goreng. Few Bintangs watching the craziness go by outside.

Had a swim and then hit the sack. It surprises me to read previous reviews about mozzies everywhere and anything negative. We have seen 1 mozzie since arriving and although there have been a few flies, it is just like Melbourne (we r from Gold Coast).

I think some people will whinge about anything but u need to remember we r in a different country and the people are different as is their lifestyle. Those who have previously complained about dirty streets and noise from road, get over it - it is all part of ""the experience"".

Well done ""the haven"" keep up the good work.

Any TA people, feel free to message me if u have any queries. I have posted this in the forum as well.

1971,Not what they boast of!,30,May 2012,"One of those trip planning when you have no choice but to stay in hotels which are part of the deals you get in tour packages, we had intuition that our stay would not be good and it came true when we checked in. Rooms were not ready, the check in process was dead slow!
Hotel is located on main road where heavy traffic passes 24 hours..! Not good for a sound sleep.

Food is just way too expensive for the quality and quantity they have to offer!

Overall service, food, accommodation is just not worth the money you have to pay for.

It was simply bad choice for me!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1972,a must stay hotel,50,November 2012,"We booked standard rooms but instead got free upgrade to suites... we cancelled our arrangements for the day and enjoyed our suites. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our suites were excellent. But the entire complex was quite large so it was a bit exhausting especially for my mom to walk from the suites to the front of the hotel. But there' a small problem with the check in time..unlike other hotels, the haven's check in time is 3pm which was pretty late for us...
But overall it was a great experience for us...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1973,Only if you enjoy rustic ...,30,November 2012,"While most of the staff were very friendly, the hotel and services did not rise to the four star level they advertise. The restaurant and bar are open air and Mosquitos and flys are a big problem. Breakfast is prepared in open air and most of the food was covered with flys. The rooms are very stark, not the warm environment I was hoping for. Large construction project going on adjacent to the hotel which was very noisy. Noise from the pool can be heard in every room (generally starting at 7:00 am). Hotel is is a great location and the live music in the bar every night was very good.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1974,Good value,40,November 2012,"i stayed in the haven recently and i was quite happy with it. The room was clean and spacious with a comfortable bed. i stayed in room 1003, which is quite close to the front of the hotel and the restaurant which has loud music. however the music stopped by 10pm every night, so it did not disturb my sleep. the rooms at the back of the hotel are nicer and quieter.
the breakfast was great and the staff very polite.
there are 3 pools, with pleasant shady areas.
overall i was satisfied and would probably stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1975,TERRIBLE SERVICE from F&B manager,10,November 2012,"On 16 Nov 2012 we stayed one night at HAVEN Bali, our resevation including breakfast. The next morning my husband could not breakfast, because he is not feeling well. I was late for breakfast because I have to keep him overnight, I’m the last guest that came to breakfast, and soon all the food had been cleared indicating that breakfast time was over. I remember my husband has not eaten anything and no food supplies in our room, I take the half rest of my waffle with a tissue.
I rushed back into the room carrying leftover waffle, want to give it to my husband, but I was stopped by one of the hotel staff who said I was not allowed to bring food outside breakfast area by Mr.CLIVE food & beverages manager. I asked to speak directly with Mr. CLIVE, because I think a manager will be able to understand my situation. But it turns out Mr. Clive insisted I should not take my leftovers food. I told him I did not take a new food, just my leftovers food, that if I did not take it, the staff will put it in trash bin.What a waste of food. After arguing with him, with anger finally he allowed me to bring the leftovers food and shouting to me that tomorrow I can’t bring food outside breakfast area again. I told him that I did not want to stay at this hotel again considering his bad behaviour, he arrogantly said “WHO CARES.”
It’s unfortunate HAVEN hotel has a manager who behaved very badly and have no tolerance to the guests who have paid to stay there.
I was reluctant to stay at this hotel again, very bad experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1976,Really nice experience,50,November 2012,"My wife and i both felt our 8 nights at the haven were well worth it in regards to value and experience. It is in a great location close to good restraunts, shops, beaches and the bintang supermarket.it is very clean and a beautiful venue. Would go back for sure. Most the staff are loverly but 2-3 had bad attitudes.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1977,Nice hotel,40,November 2012,"This was my first ever trip to Bali and I stayed at The Haven for 5 nights. I was actually there for a work conference for my business and the facilities were very good for this. I was quite surprised.
I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite with my sister and brother in law (who also took along their 8 month old son) and the room was huge. Lounge, kitchen, very spacious bathrooms (a bathroom each) - everything you need in a suite. The only thing I could fault is that the suite wasnt as pristine as you would expect for the price we paid - there were marks on the mirrors etc. Lots of wear and tear.
The pool area was fantastic - we were in the suite section of the hotel and it was very quiet and relaxing. There were always lounges available to sit on. Getting food and a cocktail was a bit hit and miss and they do run on Balinese time - so you'll be waiting for 20 mins for a cocktail.
At the other end of the hotel, you can walk out to the hustle and bustle of the main street and it was a great place to soak in the atmosphere. The drinks and food were great there, as was the band.
Breakfast was also good - lots of options - you couldnt complain.
My sister and I also got a massage and the masseurs and facilities were exceptional - we could not fault it.
Others who were staying with me (who have been to Bali before) felt that the hotel was more Legian than Seminyak, but it always felt like it was a quick walk or cab to everything.
If I went back, I would consider this hotel. For a standard room, it is very well priced. I had a good experience overall.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1978,Great value for money!! Suites are stunning,50,November 2012,"I would stay at the Haven again, after looking at it many times when in Bali we stayed here for a night and were really impressed. We booked a standard room but were upgraded to a suite and it was divine. There are many pools to choose from in different sections and plenty of day beds. The suites room are very new and really quite nice and very spacious. It is in a great spot not just in Bali but within Seminyak. It is located near all the great shops and you can get a shuttle from the hotel to the Haven beach club or you can take a less than 15 min stroll there. Brilliant location, excellent hotel and I would have to say some of the absolute loveliest staff I have encountered in all my stays in Bali. Highly recommend!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1979,Good value,40,November 2012,"Great service, they were people alwyays there to help you, clean rooms, free internet. The beach was quite far but there is a shuttle that can take u there and back, on the beach there is a nice beach club with comfortable sunbathing chairs and towels, tip: go to the restaurant next door where you can buy cheap drinks and 100 mts away there is a very picturesque spanish restaurant called ""la plancha"". The breakfast at Haven had a lot of options, from fresh fruit to poached eggs, waffles, pancakes, etc .. don't get the transportation to the Airport at the hotel, they charge you $22 dollars (extremely overprice) when you can get it cheaper outside.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1980,Great for what it is!,40,November 2012,"The Haven (Hotel - not suites or villas) is a great value for money option. It is on a very busy main street surrounded by shops and a few restaurants. It's probably the down market end of Seminyak (being closer to Legian) but I think the shopping is better than the Oberio area (which is probably better for eateries). Its a good 10-15 minute walk to the beach - but there is a shuttle service provided. Our room (and all the rooms it seemed) had a small balcony which overlooked the pool, which is relatively quiet and certainly a relaxing and pleasant place to escape the chaos of the street outside. The room was clean and modern and the kingsize bed was very comfortable. It was occasionally a little noisy - but we were quite close to the reception area. The food was standard hotel type fare - but reasonably priced and breakfast was certainly plentiful (although it would have been nice to see a few more healthy food choices). The staff couldn't have been more pleasant or helpful. It certainly isn't a luxury hotel, but for a central, comfortable and value for money hotel it ticks all the boxes.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1981,Saved by the Free Upgrade to Junior Suite,30,November 2012,"The Haven Seminyak main is a 2-face hotel. Now what do i mean by that? its entrance is located in a very busy street in seminyak. Entering the hotel the first time - My initial thought was ""Oh no this is not gonna be a good stay"" as Lobby was very close to the busy main street - You can smell the street, the car exhaust and rather noisy. Early check-in was not allowed reason being hotel was fully booked - fair enough.

As you step into the main lobby, you will immediately see the haven rooms overlooking the rather crammed swimming pool. It almost felt like everything there was very little space to breathe. Nature is obviously not part of the architecture plan on this side of the hotel.

At 3pm I finally got a room. The bell boy walked us through the crammed swimming pool, through the Villas before we finally came into the residential suite area.

To my surprise i got my room upgraded from Haven room to Junior suite (despite the fully booked hotel) - THANK U JESUS! anyway, it was nothing like what i saw on the other side of the wall (btw, 2 huge walls separate the main lobby and the residential suite area). It was much much quieter, I saw plants sprouting all over the place (in a good way) , it was open door and no roof - giving a sense of space. We have our separate lobby, swimming pool and breakfast place so it was cool.

The junior suite room was nice and spacious but when you start noticing the details like cracked floors, dated marble color , slight stains in the bathroom floor and electric main board that just suddenly popped open - you know that the hotel is not well maintained.

We had huge balcony with day bed and access to living room and bed room which is awesome.

Breakfast is just OK rather than good. Also they don't serve breakfast to rooms as it is considered as chargeable room service. Wifi automatically dropped off after 10-15 mins of inactivity (very irritating).

To sum it up, if you are looking for a quiet stay and looking for the ""BALI feel"" this is not the hotel for you. and only book junior suite or better if you have to.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1982,"An outstanding hotel for the location ,value and ambiance",50,November 2012,"The Haven in Seminyak offers and outstanding value for the location which is a short stroll to the beach in Legian. The area offers many restaurants, bars and nightclubs. The hotel GM was very accommodating and offered a fantastic room. I enjoyed my stay iat The Haven. It was relaxing by the pool on a hot Bali day. The Haven offers one of the best breakfast packages I've seen in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1983,Worst hotel I've ever stayed at!,10,November 2012,"Got eaten alive by mosquitoes even though they fogged everywhere so much I almost chocked, couldn't check in until 4pm, buffet breakfast was scattered and barely edible, the wifi wouldn't work and staff weren't prepared to help me, constantly noisy, rooms were odd and felt very basic, air con was stuck at 26 degrees, food and drinks are very expensive. Will never stay here again, it would have been nicer sleeping on the streets!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1984,Clean hotel on the Legian/Seminyak border....,30,October 2012,"Overall, this is a nice enough hotel, but the service is pretty terrible. I had much better service in every other place we stayed at in Bali.

Airport pickup - WASN'T THERE! They forgot to book it. They then said they will give us a complimentary drop-off, when we said we weren't going to the airport at the end of our stay, but will be going to Ubud, they said that will be fine. This was confirmed twice more. Then, on the day of us leaving, it was not OK. Thanks a lot chumps. We would have organised a lift there ourselves instead of having to grab a taxi. Seriously, can you guys get anything right??

Rooms - Good quality. Neat and tidy. Large enough. Good cable TV options.

Location - OK. I don't get how some people have said this hotel is in the middle of Seminyak, It isn't, it is much closer to Legian than the middle of Seminyak. It is a fair hike to the beach and most of the good Seminyak spots.

Pool and poolside service - The pools are OK, however it is hard to relax with people constantly walking past, as the pool is a main thoroughfare. The service at the pool is not very good, It is not easy to order a drink, with staff not being particularly attentive (the spend all their time watching the maintenance men). The drinks are expensive. The food was OK.

Breakfast - Brilliant. They had everything you wanted and more. Could not fault it.

Overall, I would stay here again, though would keep my options open and consider elsewhere. I most certainly wouldn't be using their overpriced transfer services that don't rock up.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1985,Not as advertised,20,November 2012,Rooms OK - though the noisy and ineffective AC mentioned by others is true. But we were promised an upmarket hotel in a quiet area on the beach. It's 15 mins from the beach along a smelly street with unusable sidewalks. The beach is filthy - raw sewage being pumped into the ocean there. The staff do not have a workable understanding of English. The wifi drops out every 10 mins. Go elsewhere.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1986,Haven Suites,40,November 2012,"We stayed 7 nights, very good location, can get hotel shuttle to the beach every 2 hours. You can walk but if you get the shuttle you can get sun bed that the Haven has. We had the suite at the back very good as the front restaurant had music every night. Only gripe was the shower over the bath very high, up to my knee so made it difficult to get in the shower. Security at front and back entrance was a lacking, at times. Other than that very good value for money. Location very good close to shops and restaurants.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1987,Haven Suites,40,December 2011,my wife and son enjoyed 10 days in a suite at the haven and we had a ball we only had a one bedroom suite but the staff had no problem setting up a single bed for my son in a corner of the large living area. it had a great veranda complete with daybed and kitchen facilities in the living area. the staff were lovely and the location is awsome.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1988,A big Air-Con fail,30,October 2012,"Stayed here for 4 nights on business so the small hotel room was only used at night for sleeping which was just as well because to our dismay, the room was 33c upon arrival and didn't go below 26c for the entire stay. The staff were concerned and ""repaired"" it but it was not working and so I gave up and adjusted. I will never stay in the hotel section again. The staff were friendly and helpful ( except for the air-con) and the location was great. We also used the Havana Club facility for a late flight out after checking out of our room.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1989,"Okay hotel, over-rated and looks better in photos",30,October 2012,"Stayed here 2 nights. On arrival, they kept me waiting 90 mins and it seemed rather arbitrary, like you are early, we no let you in.
The room s are rather stark and the dull, scuffed murky green walls are a turn off.
There is one chair but no lounge, although the rooms do have a small balcony overlooking the pool.
The pool is one of the best features here.
In good condition, easy to swim laps in. yet twice there were no towels and had to wait for them.
Smallish gym which was okay and much better than nothing.
Wifi was a bit slow but at least it was free. You can also use the common area computers for free is you don;t have your own.
Food only tried at breakfast and it was okay rather than good. Cheap and cheerful but okay when added to room price.
Checkout they kept me waiting while they checked minibar and rroom, and I really did not apprecaite this as particularly as I was not advised that everyhting was okay - I had to come back in 10 mins to ask.

All in all, it is aceptable, but it not 4 stars in terms of room quality, furnishings and service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1990,Very good,40,October 2012,"We have been positively surprised by the quality of the hotel.
Our room was big, clean and well equipped. The hotel is next to the one of the main shopping road, but quiet.
The check in process was quite slow. Our room was not ready, we then got two free drinks (on purpose to make us order something to eat?!).
The breakfast was the best buffet of our Bali trip.
It was one of the cheapest we found on the web and it was worth giving a try.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1991,Awesome!,50,October 2012,"We stayed 5 nights at the Haven in Seminyak in a regular room. We requested a room we could see from the pool as we were travelling with an infant and that request was honoured. The staff were all lovely. Our room was not ready on arrival but a welcome drink in the hotel restaurant overlooking the street while we waited was offered and we had no problem with that. Easy enough to get to the busy parts like legian and kuta by taxi... we walked to Melasti most nights though with no problems.
The band in the hotels sounded awesome. We could hear it loud and clear from our room but it was finished by 10.30 so no interuptions to our sleep and we couldnt hear our neighbours or other patrons despite being right near a walkway
Great hotel, great exeperience. I would recommend it and definitely stay here again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1992,Great Location,40,September 2012,"This would be my 3rd stay lovely Hotel and happy and friendly service from Receptions both the Hotel and Suite side. Unfortunately I was given a suite next to where construction for the new Horison Hotel is being build so the noise starts rather early from 8am onwards.

1997,"Good location,clean facility all round and a well managed hotel",40,October 2012,Loved this hotel but would like to see the grassed area at the pool utilized with sun lounges as this is really the only area that the late afternoon sun hits.Otherwise by 3 pm ish most of the pool and lounge area is in the shade .Also kill the music in the restaurant as it makes trying to get an early nights sleep impossible if u r getting up for a day trip or have had an early start that day.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
1998,"Great location, great hotel",50,September 2012,"Myself and a group of friends stayed at The Haven for four nights and we were truly impressed! Right in the heart of Seminyak (lots of great shopping available within easy walking distance), as soon as you walk in you feel as though you are in another world. The noise and chaos of the street disappears with the friendly smiles of the staff. Free wifi is available in common areas such as the restaurant, as well as in each room. Breakfast buffet is included with eggs made to order. A big plus for me was that the fruit was safe to eat (i.e. not washed in potential 'Bali belly' inducing water). There is a Circle K (convenience store) across the road where you can buy bottled water etc which was great.

The Haven also have drivers available with cars (what we would consider mini vans or people movers) seating 7 which was ideal for our large group. If you find a driver who you like and is knowledgable you can choose to book them for full days in advance if needed. Our driver from The Haven was absolutely fantastic and made us feel safe and at ease in the chaotic Bali traffic and we were able to book him on multiple occasions for both single trips and full days (a full 8 hour day with our driver cost IDR400,000 - approx AU$40 - and they will stay with you for the day, waiting for you at each destination).

The only small issue we had a couple of times was communication. All staff speak English well, but there can be a gap in communication if you, or the staff, are trying to discuss more in depth questions. We found that giving staff the benefit of the doubt helped where there was any ambiguity as they really did try very hard to help and understand.

Our group had both standard hotel rooms at The Haven as well as a Villa. The rooms are great, but the Villa is absolutely amazing including a private pool, butler, huge bathroom, and a lovely guy who lights candles around the pool each night. We stayed at a number of hotels and Villas in Bali during our stay, and we all agree The Haven is at the top of our list for the future!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
1999,"Very nice , all that you need and more",40,August 2012,"Had a very nice 7 night stay . Hotel has all you need and more . Good value , almost unbelivable considering what you get . Good location with lots to offer within walking distance . Great spa treatments and massage . Breakfast was fine but could have some healthier options and more traditional Indonsesian food . No complaints .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2000,Great all rounder hotel,40,September 2012,"Wifi available in every room was a plus for us! The main downside was 8am music piped throughout the hotel - nice music, Balinese and peaceful but could have done without it. The staff were very helpful, great English, and the location was excellent for us - not too upmarket but close to everything. Would definitely stay here again.
(re other commenters and noise, we saw the construction going on next door so that might be a problem for a bit longer but it looked close to completion - we didn't have any problems in the front section of the hotel but towards the back of that first main building, other than the previously mentioned piped music).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2001,Would be a wonderful haven if not for the constant noise,30,September 2012,"We stayed at The Haven for 8 nights with two children under 12 years of age in September/October 2012 and had two interconnecting Hotel rooms. The resort is wonderful - great rooms, friendly staff and beautiful outdoor areas. Unfortunately there is little respite from incessant noise anywhere in the Hotel at the moment. We asked to move initially due to the construction noise from next door (drilling and banging non-stop from 8am - 9pm). Once we had moved, we were relocated close to reception where the constant traffic noise is dulled, however the live entertainment every evening will ensure that even the most exhausted children are unable to sleep. Upon requesting to move to the back of the complex (suites) we were told we would incur an additional US$50/night. All in all a marvellous place to stay only if you can be guaranteed a room that will really provide ""a haven"".",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2002,Great Stay,40,June 2012,Stayed for the June long weekend . Clean and well located. Helpful and friendly staff. Walking distance to so great local restaurants. Good value and band a nice breakfast buffet. As we had a very late evening flight were able to leave luggage and then return to use shower facilities at no extra cost before we left.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2003,Very nice surprise!,40,September 2012,"We stayed in a Havenroom for a total of 7 nights (in 2 visits) in september 2012. The Haven is a relatively new hotel in the center of Seminyak.
The location is awesome as it is situated at the main street wich also crosses over to Legian, Kuta. The restaurantarea (Ultimo, Rumours, Zappa's)
is just a heartbeat away. A taxi will take you there in a few minutes. We loved the design of the hotel with it's nice facade and interiour. The hanging gardens
are also a nice touch. The swimmingpool is awesome. Big and you'll be able to swim some good laps. Ask for the ball(s) and play some volleyball!
The Havenrooms are simple but nice. Good beds, clean interiour, nice balcony and great shower (in room 2004). Bare in mind that there are rooms that have a shower
as other rooms (I think the complete 4th floor) have baths. We liked the gamelanmusic in the hallways and there is also music at the swimmingpool.
The service is up there but there is room for improvement. The main thing is the poor English with some of the personnel. It happened quite often that questions
were forwarded to another person who spoke better English. The responsetime was slow at times. For example: no towels in the gym --> 15 minutes after our call someone
showed up with towels. Improve on these things and I think the Haven can be a stand out hotel. Breakfast was okay, but a little more variation would be nice. The live music
in te restaurant is fun. The gym is small, but the pool makes up for that. All in all we loved our stay. We booked this hotel with Agoda for 90 euro's per night so I think
that the value was awesome. We will definitely return here!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2004,Great location,40,October 2011,"Stayed here on my business trip .great location to get around .Staff were extremely help full.Don't recommend for family's.
Rooms are very clean .even though on main road nice and quiet.
Need more lounge chairs .not much sun for sun lovers .
Excellent for the business traveler.
Thanks Haven",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2005,Good price if got discount,30,September 2012,"I Stayed from 18 Sept - 20 Sept 2012. The restaurant is noisy, don't know why they have to turn the music load until midnight, while nobody eating. I stayed in Haven Room no. 3001, and asked to change the room to 4018 because of that, but unfortunately the room also noisy, this time from the air condition (AC), they need to repair the AC. The Hotel near to the boutiques in Seminyak road, with few restaurants, but need to walk around 15 mnts to the beach. The hotel provided shuttle to beach. The hospitality ok, but the room very standard, quality for 3 star hotel, but the price 4 - 5 star hotel. Pool ok, not big, but enough. The bathroom door is made of glass, so not suitable if you travelling with your son. I don't like the bed, too soft for backbone. The room interior design very standard, but the space ok for two people.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2006,Expected More !!!,20,September 2012,"I really was looking forward to this Hotel and Bali trip, a few hours in and I am already disappointed. we have unfortunately been let down by the management and haven staff, if you are going to offer 4 star or better services at least offer a welcome drink to the guests! The front reception takes 20 minutes to sort out our checking and then tell us our room is not ready until 3pm, not good. It was 12 noon so we had to wait 3 hours for the room, I then had to continually ask them for the room rather than them identify we were waiting by the pool, service was poor for such a nice property, let's hope it improves so I can report something positive!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2007,Great hotel in Seminyak,40,September 2012,"We stayed here for 7 nights a week ago. The over all experience was fantastic. Staff were very friendly. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a suite with our 'MyTime' deal that we got. The suites were very nice indeed. Big bad, wrap around balcony with outdoor beds and a big dining table. Very spacious and clean. We seemed to get a few mosquitos in the room though.

The breakfast was amazing. The suites and villes have their own pool and dining area, which is great. Alot of options for breakfast: omelette station, pancake and waffle station, many different types of breads and pastries, hot breakfast items like bacon, sausages. They rotate the hot items every day so you get variety. They had nasi goreng, chicken curry on some days. They also have cereals, tropical fruit and cold meats & cheese. Loved it!

The hotel restaurant and bar Sabeen is great. You can sit and watch all the people and scooters go by. They usually have live entertainment each night. We didnt eat there but food looked quite good.

Gym is quite small and basic but does the job if you are keen to use it whilsts on holidays. Has 3 cardio machines, dumbells, 1 bench and 1 all in one weight machine.

The pool/s were great. Always staff there to help. Great big sun beds in the suite area. Was fantastic.

Location wise, its in the middle of everything. Its a handy location. A short walk to the beach and shops. Bintang supermarket is pretty close as well. Not that close to the fancier bars but its a short cab ride away. They are cheap enough anyway.

Overall, had an excellent stay. I would definitely stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2008,Pleasant place to stay,40,September 2012,"Nice place. Very attractive rooms with comfy beds. Very nice breakfast. it's always weird to be in a tourist place on business; sitting alone, but this wasn't bad even for eating alone.

I booked through agoda at the last minute and couldn't get the confirmation to forward to the hotel. I was showing it to them on my iPad, but they wouldn't check me in till they got the PDF. Seemed silly, but it's a huge place, maybe they get people cheating?",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2009,Holiday,40,April 2012,Went with my Wife for a get away since i was in Singapore. Not a Bad hotel but a long walk to the beach. Good Pool. Rooms are good but the one close to the restaurant is a bit noisy especially when they have there music. They changed the room though when we complained the next day. The overall trip was good. we were out most of the time. Good place to see.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2010,Perfect location away from Kuta,50,October 2011,"I too am a little late doing my review as I am new to Trip Advisor but I loved The Haven! Rooms were perfect, pools were amazing, the Spa was absolutely delightful I spent my whole birthday there being pampered. The location is great for shopping and dinner. Its a little walk from the beach but the hotel offers a free bus. Breakfast was amazing I still day dream about the waffles with banana and chocolate syrup. Free wifi with a strong connection.

Overall i loved this hotel and really hope to go back soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2011,Trendy hotel but poor and expensive food and drink let's it down,30,September 2012,"Nice modern hotel, clean and pleasant rooms. A noisy area though and 20 minute walk to the beach on a precarious street. Cockerels noisy all night and construction site next dooe
Breakfast is not bad fresh egg station and pancake station
Had poolside meal - absolutely terrible food. Definitely go out and eat do not stay at the hotel for food. Drinks also very expensive",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2012,"Peaceful,comfy,amazing service",40,November 2011,"I am 2 years late in writing the review for Haven, but then Haven is a special place for me so will anyways let everyone know about the place. We reached Haven in November'10. We got a room overlooking the pool, it was clean and had a elegant touch to it. The bed was comfortable , the balcony had enough space for 2 people to sit.The LCD was working fine and ac was comfortable. The room service is a bit slow but they are very polite and helpful. The breakfast has a good variety and when I asked them to deliver the breakfast to our room,they obliged which was really sweet of them. The pool is nice and there were people to assist with towels and beach chairs. The property is huge , when we reached the beach, Haven services helped us with beach towels and beach chairs. The best part about Haven was that despite being on the main road , the hotel is peaceful.
The reception services are commendable , our check in and check out took 5 mins each. It was a pleasant stay and would definitely recommend it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2013,A lovely place to stay in Bali,40,September 2012,"Great location Hotel, though I would like abit closer to the beach next time. Lots of boutique style shopping just outside the hotel. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, which included 2 bathrooms, kitchen with full sized fridge and 3 LCD TVs.Airconditioning in every room.2 balconys overlooking pool area. Kitchen was very poorly equipped, it had a hotplate but no cooking utensils ect.. I complained about this on our 2nd last day and they advised us they can supply on request! The bathrooms were very nice, just a bit of mould in the shower is the only complaint.
Breakfast very nice, we had freshly cooked waffles with cream and fruit, plus they can cook you eggs in every way and bacon.
The main complaint was the pools were too cold to swim in, being not much sun hits them during the day.This was disappointing as we longed for evening dips!Hotel staff were very friendly and attentive.
Our room keys kept locking us out of our room(3 times in 1 week) which was very annoying.The rooms have free WiFi, if you can manage to understand the difficult usernames and passwords!!
All in all a great holiday!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2014,Great hotel,50,September 2012,"Stayed 10 days at this hotel , this was my partners first time to Bali and my 4th. We both loved the hotel and the friendly staff. If you like great service and a relaxed atmosphere come here. There did not seem to be any of the Aussie bogans here in seminyak or the hotel so was an over all good experience. We did have to change our room to a double bed room as we had been booked in twin single but that was
Just for one night then we had room changed. Great location close to everything you want bars , clubs , and restaurants. And only about 30000rp in a taxi to discovery centre in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2015,So so,10,September 2012,"Hotel does not carry the essence of Bali. Has a modern boutique touch but has an element of being poorly managed.
Building has a strange shape with some of the rooms on the pool level being damp, dark and smelly.

We had to shift from the first allotted room because of state of the toilet, the next room the TV was not working.

Staff sound friendly but not sure if they are able to deliver the service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2016,Great Value,40,September 2012,"Stayed here three times and the only thing wrong every time was on check in that the room was never ready by 3pm check in time and had been upgraded 2 of the times,The hotel is in a great location and very close to the beach,5 minute walk .The picture shows one part of the hotel and has two mirror entrances with the suites in the middle that separates the rooms.
Has two great pools that both have some shade and plenty sun for that needed tan.
All rooms are great ,no need to spend the earth as the standard room is a great size and comes with all the standard bathroom stuff one will expect from hotels.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2017,Awesome location,40,June 2012,Great location and good value for money. The breakfast that is included is the best I've ever had in Bali with a massive range of options and eggs and pancakes cooked to order. Hotel getting a bit tired but location makes up for that.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2018,Management lied. Either housekeeping or extra personnel came and stole from the minibar.,10,August 2012,"I'm just checking out. I was all set to write a nice review until I came to settle my bill. We travel a lot for corporate stays and never use the mini bar as it violates corporate policy. They said they are missing 4 bintang beers, a bottle of Evian and another bottle of water. And asked us to pay. We clearly can afford to pay and even paid now because $40 means nothing to us. But i raised hell with the manager insisting this is terrible service as we did not use any of those items. There was even a condom (sealed) on top of thr mini bar and I am wondering if someone came in and used our room when we were out. I never leave bad reviews and have traveled so much in my life and even if the room was sub par I never said anything. I am leaving this negative review this time because I take it very personally when it is implied that we are lying. They are still researching this and want to give us a free lunch which I obviously don't want and won't take. Everything was great about the hotel until this point. I loved the breakfast. Room was just okay nothing special. I've been to Seminyak 5 times now and will never again come to this hotel or refer this to anyone. Our feedback to the corporate travel manager will be to remove this from the list and blacklist it. Thankfully we are senior enough at work to make this happen.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2019,"Beautiful property, clean comfortable, friendly",50,August 2012,"Stayed here for 4 nights, just in a normal Haven room. Was looking over the main pool and just lovely. Bed was very comfortable, air con worked perfectly. Was a little noisy in the morning with some kids in the main pool but considering that only happened around 9am, it wasn't an issue.
Breakfast was amazing, so many options!
The pool in the Suites section was nice and peaceful with very comfy day beds.
We thought the Spa was outstanding, good value and super relaxing.
Went down to the beach club one morning and they were very helpful, putting out day beds for us. Only thing that would have been nice there would be food/drink service but short walk to the bar was alright.
Overall a great stay. The location is excellent, right on the main street but the rooms are set back enough so you don't hear the street noise. Would stay again in an instant!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2020,It could have been better,30,August 2012,"I stayed in one of their suites for two nights. Upon checked in, the staff guided me to my room. It was a long pleasant walk from the hotel lobby (Jl. Seminyak) to my suite -- Property is nice. I should mention that the staff who guided me to my room was doing a good job.

After unpacking my stuff, I went to the restaurant next to the suites lobby for a dinner. Shortly after I order my meal, I was surprise to see mice running toward the dining area and hid behind the big vase. One of the waiters was surprise to see me Surprise -- I told the waiter to get rid of the mice, but the mice ran toward the lobby.

On my last day, I invited my friend to join me for breakfast at the suite restaurant. It was obvious that staffs at the restaurant were too lazy to service us -- We assume because we are Indonesian not foreigner. I waived at them, but they pretended not to see us. Until I kindly asked them to give us a table, then they did. My friend who joined me for breakfast works for Banyan Tree resort in Bali, she couldn't stop laughing at the attitude of the staffs, they were rude. We kindly asked for a table in the quiet section, but she (waitress with a glasses) refused to give us the table because we were 2 people and the table was for 4 people. Well, not too long after -- she gave the table to an Australian couple. I asked her, why we didn't get that table? She just simply ignore us as we were not exist. Fortunately, some trainees at the restaurant were happy to serve all the guests, including us with a big smile and great attitude.

Check-out process was fast and convenience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2021,Good Value and Great Location,40,December 2011,"Originally booked a junior suite but then upgraded upon check in. Stayed here with my mom and sister. It has comfort of luxury amenities with greenery view and tantalizing natural scent of Bali. Stayed at the 2 bedrooms suite with a spacious interior. It has an exclusive pool for the suites guest. The suites has a VERY spacious living room that has a wide LCD TV, in room Audio and DVD player. Free Internet too and fast! There's a day bed on the wide wooden balcony to lazy around and enjoy your beer. Very kids friendly, it and its very quite, relaxing and calm too. Located at the very busy area of seminyak so do expect traffic at times. Was able to get late-check out at no charge.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2022,Good value,40,August 2012,"Bearing in mind I hate large resorts - this place was nowhere near as bad as I expected!
It was a two night stay at the end of a very relaxed and chilled out trip in Bali. The first room I was offered was at the front of the hotel - motorbike noise meant that there would be no way I would sleep. I asked to change and they did so immediately.
The room was clean and well serviced. Breakfast was good and plentiful. Beds comfortable. Pool was peaceful. Beach Club was a bonus. Boxed breakfast provided for early morning departure.
My only complaint would be the restaurant which was VERY noisy - motorbikes from street, water feature, piped music and conversations needing to be loud to compete with all of this!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2023,"small and simple, great location, overpriced",40,December 2011,"great location right in the heart of seminyak, but not near the beach and it feels a bit cramped. simple room, nothing fancy (especially considering the price). The pool is central but only gets sun during mid-day (since it's surrounded by buildings.) overall, pretty nice but seemed a bit pricey for what you get.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2024,Overpriced but well located,30,November 2011,"I've been in this hotel a couple of times. The first time, it was brand new and I booked a suite for three people for a very reasonable price. That's why I did book a double room the second time I visited Bali. This last time it was a bit disappointing . The room was a bit wasted and we found some bugs like spiders and mosquitoes. The staff is very friendly all the time, but the prices of the drinks and food at the hotel are overpriced for the balinese standards.
The best thing is the location. Just 5 minutes by car to Oberoi Street.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2025,Pleasant stay at The Haven,40,September 2011,"Good location in Seminyak area. Good room with complete amenities. Clean. Nice bed. However I stayed at the room close to the lobby and it is quite noisy 11pm-12am I can hear the singer from the bar - it was okay though as I was there for business trip and didn't want to have the Villas as they are located further at the back and is not so convenient for staying alone especially during night time.

However, as the room is quite small, their bathtub is just next to the bed which I found quite weird but the basin was great and big. The shower was okay - perhaps cleaner would be better (for the value of money that we paid). Breakfast was okay - nothing exciting.

This is a popular hotel for Indonesian and saw quite a bit of tourists staying here too. This hotel is a busy hotel - maybe you should try consider other hotel if you want somewhere really quiet. The pool area is great and the terrace from the room is good too. Overall, it was a pleasant stay at The Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2026,Nice place to stay,40,August 2012,"Stayed here for couple of days in August 2010 in suite, which I strongly recommend to spend holidays. Kitchen annex with all equipment, living room, bedroom and big bathroom. Excellent option instead of overcrowded beach is small but pleasant swimming pool with sunbeds. Pollite and helpful staff, good breakfast, nothing to complain. The biggest surprise was small cake with wishes on my birthday. Nice.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2027,Great!,50,July 2012,"We stayed in this beautiful hotel for 10 days and we had a great time.
Very nice rooms, excellent breakfast and very helpful staff.
Nothing to complain about.
Will definitely go back during our next visit in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2028,A good option.,30,August 2012,"Our recent stay at the Haven was actually pretty. We booked online after arriving and spending a few days in the craziness of Kuta and managed a great deal.

Younger staff seem to struggle with multiple check ins at the same time, so patience is recommended :-)

This is a relatively new resort and as such is in pretty good shape maintenance wise.

The pools are both beautiful and clean, however, dont get a whole lot of sun. Mornings are the best for the front pool for sun baking. The rear pool is pretty much always shaded and is a great place to chill in the afternoons.

Breakfast was ok. Better than most. Room service meals are reasonably priced and tasty.

All in all, at the rates we paid, pretty good value, comfortable beds and friendly staff.

Location-wise, the only criticism is that there are limited options for eating out. The beach front restaurants are an easy 5-10 minute walk away ( and there are some GREAT options there), and Kuta , Legian and Seminyak restaurant strips are all a short cheap cab ride away.

Given the option , I would stay here again and would have rated it at 3 1/2 - the higher side of average.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2029,A real haven to escape busy Seminyak,50,August 2012,"Wonderful week with 2 little girls (aged 4 and 1) and husband. Buffet breakfast was a hit, very clean facilities and friendly staff. Great location for shopping and beach. Great swimming pools and spa onsite. Staff always very helpful. Eg. asked for TV colour in room to be adjusted. Technician came and replaced TV within 10 minutes.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2030,Slightly run down but convenient location for shopping,20,July 2012,"Overall very central location, breakfast was ok nothing special, staff friendly but often do not understand your requests, upon arrival we were put in the wrong room( 2 single beds) I booked a double bed for wife and myself, the hotel was ful so they could only move us to another room the following day, the toilet drain had a bad stench, also there was lots of noise from neighboring rooms, when we moved rooms some of my clothes as well as drinks were stolen from the room! I don't think I will stay here again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2031,Large bottles of water provided in rooms,40,July 2012,"Pretty much agree with other reviews as far as service, facilities etc, that they were very good and staff great. However, a recommendation to other guests to be aware as we weren't that large bottles of water put in our rooms were not marked 'The Haven' as were the contents of the fridge. We thought the large bottles, like the small were free, and used them. On checking out of our rooms were charged about $A11 x 2 which we were a little annoyed about since they could be bought down the road at the supermarket for a fraction of the the price.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2032,Swimming pools are cold and hotel food bland and boring,20,July 2012,Stayed for a week at this hotel and absolute loved the rooms. We booked a two bedroom suite and it was massive. Staff were friendly but hard to communicate. Food at the hotel was average and bland. Breakfast was unorganised and chaotic. Both swimming pools were cold and shady and hardly got any sun. Would not stay here again as prefer a larger pool area with lots of sun. I could have paid less and got more value for my money.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2033,Fantastic experience,50,June 2012,"Well located, great service, buffet breakfast to die for. 7 minute walk to the beach, shuttle buses on the hour, to and from the The Haven's beach spot. Make sure you have a massage on site, slightly more expensive than on the street, but very indulgent.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2034,Very Good Value for Stay and Location,40,July 2012,"I was actually booked their standard room but up graded to suite. They mentioned about the on going construction of a new hotel next to our wing on the suite. The moment we enter the suite all I can say it was so SPACIOUS. The overall room condition perhaps not in the immaculate state but they are very minor to me, small crack on the floor won't harm your feet. Even though there was a construction work next door, once you shut the door, you hardly hear the noise, so I absolutely could have a good rest at the suite. All the amenities are just right and enough, just 1 weird condition, we have a nice complete kitchen set with electric stove, but no cooking utensils present.
The breakfast was excellent, their choices are just nice and right, most are might be just standard, but somehow they were different. This hotel sits on the right spot of the trendy area of Seminyak, with its lovely shops and culinary delights. Just for about 5 minutes walk from the suite lobby, you can reach the beach. There are hotel-beach shuttle, but not to worry about missing them, only 5 minutes walk, not a big deal at all. The Beach Club really a nice touch, accommodating hotel guests to who want to sunbathe or playing on the beach. This Hotel is really a good value in many aspects.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2035,Wi-FI as slow as it was 2 years ago,40,July 2012,Returned because the haven meets all my other needs... Hoping the wi-FI would work better.....NOT... In fact it may be WORSE... The password is printed in the SMALLEST LETTERING POSSIBLE ON A COMPUTER... Every time a device is turned off you must re-enter these ridiculous user names and password!!! And every time you must locate glasses or a much younger Person to read to read these ridiculously small letters and numbers that are so close together they must have been printed with some special printer that is not friendly to the human eye!!! I find this to be ridiculous ... Also don't bother to memorize these minute numbers and letters because these teeny tiny passwords change every couple of days... Who knows why?? If the rationale for this craziness is they don't want non quest to use their wi-FI I would say they are hugely successful because NOBODY guest or not would stick around to deal with this... We are laughing because we have just been here two days but by tomorrow it will no longer be funny and I will surely tell them in no uncertain terms that in order for me to come back they will have to prove to me that they have a new wi-FI that is meant for human consumption with a speed that will allow you to conduct business beyond the pace of a turtle!!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2036,everything needs a good scrub!,20,July 2012,"Well designed hotel, good location, nice friendly staff, it is popular and well used , BUT... needs a good clean and staff need training and better supervision to do their jobs!
This hotel tries to have European standards but falls short on cleaning of bathrooms. When I checked in at 9pm I had housekeeping scrub my shower, and the results AFTER cleaning are shown in photo..... The mirror next to toilet had stains and splashes on it and was never cleaned in 4 days....
Breakfast: plenty of choice, but too many disorganised staff, who do not understand simple request, such as “coffee with hot milk “....
At check in I asked for a quiet room, I was given a room facing the lobby and restaurant where a band played loud music in the evening. I complained and was told it finishes at 10, it did that night but other nights went on loudly till nearly 11......
When the hotel advertising uses such words as retreat, luxury, serenity, you have certain expectations. Sadly these were not met on this occasion. The hotel has a new GM so I hope that he can quickly whip it into shape and ensure that client’s expectations are met.
I stayed in a standard double room, directly over the swimming pool....",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2037,Some positives and some negatives,30,July 2012,"We stayed in the Deluxe rooms on July 2012.

There are some positives that I will list out in the hotel:
- staff very friendly and responsive
- clean rooms and hotel area
- delicious breakfast buffet
- excellent location in Seminyak

What we didn't like:

1. Noisy room especially those close to the restaurant & lower level. They play loud music (sometime live band) that goes until 11pm. It is also closer to the road so more traffic noise.

2. Very strange hotel room design especially the bathroom. First, there is only a semi-transparent glass over it so its not that private at all. Secondly, in the deluxe room the toilet is right next to the entrance which is right opposite the bed. So its very awkward in the morning as you wake up to the sound of your partner doing the no. 2.. Thirdly, no mirror on the TV table for makeup, wife had to drag a seat to the mirror near the entrance door.

3. Noisy bed. Especially on the twin room my in-laws were in. Every time they turn or make a move the bed makes a squealing noise. VERY annoying.

4. Unprofessional management promising you garbage. Initially my in-laws were promised to be moved to a room on 3rd floor because we complained about the bed and the band noise.. They confirmed us in the morning.. but ended up returning at night only to get a room on first floor almost next to the restaurant! We were told it was due to the morning shift staff miscommunication with the afternoon shift staff.

All in all its a good hotel if you are young and you dont really care about where you will be staying. But not recommended for family at all. And at the price they charge, I would probably look at other alternatives and would definitely not make Haven Seminyak my first preference.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2038,Fair,30,July 2012,"We booked a deluxe room (in the Suites & Villas wing) which was fairly small (by Asian hotel standards) so I'm not sure what their standard rooms would have been like! Other reviews are spot on: finishing isn't quite there, room showing signs of wear & tear (grouting in bathroom starting to get mouldy around shower and sink areas; small cigarette burns on curtain and furniture; A/C a little clunky) but for the price in central Seminyak it's still good value. You will still get a quiet night's sleep and all the mod-cons expected in a newly built hotel. Staff are willing to please and in general, provide a good quality of service. This being Bali, may I suggest you keep your valuables out of sight, even in hotel rooms...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2039,What a little beauty hidden behind the hustle and bustle,50,July 2012,"Amazing hotel that spans quite a distance, almost presented as 3 different hotels with a definite young persons section and a family section separated by the private villas. Pools were aesthetically pleasing but quite cold as they don't get much sun. Breakfast was amazing! Go down the suite end for breakfast as its slightly better than the one in the main entrance. Great location. Under the bed was filthy when we arrived and took 3 days for them to clean it properly even after we specifically asked reception to ensure it was done, bathroom could have been cleaner too but in their defence almost everywhere we stayed was similar and I just think its a bit of out of sight out of mind with the Balinese. Would definitely recommend this hotel and woul stay here again for sure! If you find your air conditioner isn't working make sure your balcony door is closed and locked because if it's open it will automatically trip the air conditioner and you will cook.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2040,Great hide out in the middle of seminyak,40,July 2012,"I was a bit skeptic before we stayed here due to some bad reviews we read. When we arrived at the place it was very nice and clean. We didn't feel like we were in the middle of the busy street of legian. The staff was quite friendly in providing our requests. Too bad the beach is about 10 minutes walk and the shuttle only goes there every two hours. Overall, it was a nice stay. If you want to walk along the shops on legian, it is a recommended place to stay. If you want to spend most of your time on the beach ... Hmm, not here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2041,Excellent in every way but not for sun baking around pool lovers,40,July 2012,"I have just finished a 7 day stay here in suites area of hotel. Everything was fantastic- breakfast, staff, cleanliness, location, except only downside was the pool gets no full sun except for 1 sunlounge that is taken by 8.30am once people work it out. This to me was very disappointing as I only had 7 days and it was my 40th birthday present to myself. Very trendy styling and layout of suites and hotel great. Sabeen restaurant in hotel at front great spot for drinks etc. Used Sanda Spa for great $7 massages which is located in lane way at back entrance to Suites. Magnificent Pearl Restuarant located in Double Six road nearby as too was Cafe Manzano (pizza and kid friendly) and Sangra Ria? SIP restaurant near Bintang good. Great shopping if you walk and turn left into laneway at Cafe Marzano; walks all the way past Niksoma and Padma. Great little beach restaurant at beach club called Crystal Palace. La Lucciola still divine. Ultimos fantastic and dirt cheap. If you are in town TJ's Mexican in Poppies Lane 1 is great especially for kids.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2042,Has potential but I definitely wouldnt return.,20,July 2012,"There's a thousand and one shops, restaurants and hotels in this area so location is great. The hotel is somewhat pretty in comparison to the others but I would try somewhere else if we return to the area.

The room had a smoky smell and when we complained they sent two members of staff with an air freshener! Luckily we didn't spend much time in the room. Also the pool was filled with kids which made our room quite noisy but again since we were out most of the time we didn't care. Had we wanted to spend time in the room, it would have been a bad time.

Breakfast was ok, staff was ok, room was ok but smelled of smoke. So if we return, we'd take our chances elsewhere. Don't get me wrong the place is beautiful, but just not polished as we like.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2043,Only stay in the suite when the construction site's next door is finished,30,July 2012,"We booked the standard room hotel for 2 nights. Since they had water pipes problem, they had to moved us to another sister hotel (ananta) on first night, then we got upgraded to the suite on the second night.

The suite is spacious and nice. But had problem with maintenance (hot water not working - we had to move to another suite at night). And there's contruction site exactly right beside the suite. It's very hard to relax with all the banging noise and the workers' voice shouting in the background. We tried to cover the sund with tv and radio - not working. Furthermore they won't stop working before 10pm at the earliest. So it's very annoying indeed...

We do appreciate the management and staff's effort to provide great service despite all the problems.

I would only go back here if they already finish the construction site next door. Other than that, i don't think the suite is a good place to stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2044,"Poor room design, stale smokey scent & rude managers",20,July 2012,"On arrival, we were told that since we had booked through other ""cheaper websites"" we had to have a twin room. The room was poorly designed and only had frosted glass separating the toilet area from the bedroom. The room had a very smokey stale scent which required the air conditioning to be on constantly to drown out the awful smell. Once we were shown our room at 9pm at night we then had to endure a 20 minute ""tour of our room"" to be shown what was in our mini-bar, how to open the veranda door, all of the tv channels, and then he proceeded to get the complimentary slippers out of their bags and place them at either side of our bed. This was highly unnecessary for us. The check-in staff were perhaps the most rude, but all the other members of staff were amazingly friendly. There are much nicer places to stay in Bali and I would not return to the Haven again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2045,A good hotel in a great location,30,June 2012,"Very centrally located hotel. Love the hotel breakfast buffet. Good variety of food. Stayed on ground floor, right outside is the pool side which can be abit noisy otherwise everything is good. Clean, comfortable bed. Very friendly staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2046,Lovely place to stay,50,May 2012,"Went in a family group of twelve to attend a wedding , ages from 8 to 60. The Haven was a lovely place to stay. Great position. Lots to do nearby.Sabeen Restaurant great fall back if we wanted to stay close to home. Pools a little chilly but especially the villa pool and suite one just beautiful to hang out by. Buffet breakfast to die for. But , hands down the greatest feature were the staff who were warm , friendly and unfailingly helpful. My daughter is unwell at the moment and their unfeigned kindness was greatly appreciated. Special thanks to Marcel (Villas) and the people he worked with. Cleanliness excellent. Afternoon teas great fun.Recommend The Haven Villa and Suites to all.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2047,Fantastic amenities and staff,50,July 2012,"We just spent 9 days in one of their two bedroom suites and it was glorious!! The buffet breakfast was always excellent as well as the afternoon tea!! Exceptional, I can't wait to go back!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2048,Perfect!!,50,June 2012,"My husband and I spent two nights n three days.The villa with pool was just divine, lovely couldn't ask for anything better.However on our check in we informed the staff that we were on honeymoon n we expected them to at least throw some flowers on the bed and make it special but nothing happened. Other than that the restaurant was fantastic n the service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2049,Service could be better,30,October 2011,"We stayed in the suites at the back of the hotel. Front of the hotel is a bit of a chaos, busy and noisy. Suites are spacious, maintenance however is poor, bad paintwork, lamps not working, leaking airco, cracked floors etc. Staff is friendly, they mean well but most of them are unexperienced in practically everything. Proper management can be heplfull. It all lacks passion.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2050,loved it,50,November 2011,"had a great stay here in November 2011, beautiful setting in such a hectic part of town. feel like you are miles away from any busy street. great modern rooms, great breakfast. loved it!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2051,Great home base,50,July 2012,"We stayed here for a week, 2 families, 5 suites and excellent staff... Was easy to base ourselves out of for the week and close to shops, beach and attractions and far enough from the fast life of Kuta that a $3 taxi ride was an easy fix for the early 20's in our group.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2052,Lovely piece of paradise,50,July 2012,"We stayed here for a week while attending a course at the hotel. The hotel is large - there are hotel rooms at the front, private villas in the middle and suites in the back. We stayed in a two bedroom suite - a queen bed in one room and two singles in the other. The rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. Breakfast was included in our package and was a huge buffet including an egg, meat and pancake/waffle station where you could customize your order. The only negative for us was the number of Mosquitos but this is a problem throughout Bali, not just at the Haven. The cleaning staff were always available to come and spray the room. It's also worthwhile bringing your own mosquito repellent.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2053,Difficult to criticise but difficult to praise,30,June 2012,"We stayed 4 nights in a small, modern, very clean & comfortable room.
The location, on Jl Seminyak is excellent for shopping although the real classy shops of yesteryear seem to have moved elsewhere.
There are very few restaurants in the immediate vicinity & whilst the hotel food is good & reasonably priced you will have to taxi to better restaurants.
We thought the breakfast buffet was good with a good variety.
Staff were friendly & helpful but we found housekeeping a bit annoying. Each morning we put out the ""Service my room"" sign at 9 am but it was never done before 4 pm. I feel you pay for a serviced room. Also they did not leave facewashers or handtowels after the first day.
Free internet access was appreciated but I found it difficult with many of the letters worn off.
I started off with a ""very good"" rating & it is close to that but needs a management ""nudge""",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2054,So so,30,June 2012,"I found the hotel a bit disappointing after all the rave reviews I had read. The hotel is starting to show its age and maintenance is lacking. Service is average, breakfast is so so. Location is good if you want to be right in the middle of Seminyak (next to Bintang mkt). If you are after peace and quiet, go elsewhere.
I enjoyed the fact they had facilities at the beach (staff there was great btw), but you wouldn't want to rest there for long: surroundings are not great + there is a construction site.

Overall, not very good value for money I found. (I usually stay in a villa for the same price)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2055,Very comfortable and well run,50,June 2012,"We recently spent two nights in the Haven Suites in Seminyak.
Our suite was huge in excellent condition and well maintained. The pool was delightful, the staff efficient and courteous. The food was good. The location is on the border between Seminyak and Legian.
All in all a great place to stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2056,Best place to stay,50,May 2012,"We looked at lots of hotels and villas in the seminyak area and read 100's of reviews and i must say we definately picked the best place to stay!!

The Haven was excellent in every way:

The Haven is split into three areas, it has a hotel area with a pool and a suite area with another pool and inbetween are the villas. It offers two entrances, one for hotel guests which is located on a busy street and the other located in a quiet side street is for suite and villa guests but both are accessable for all guests. There are lots of shops, resturants and money changers in the area. Across the road at the front of the hotel is a circle k (like a 7/11) The security even stop the traffic for you to cross the road. Its about a 15 minute walk to the beach but they offer a shuttle to and from their beach area which has sun lounges and umbrellas. There is construction next door but it didnt affect our stay.

Staff: They are what make the Haven a very enjoyable place to stay. The staff were very friendly, polite and very accomodating. Nothing was ever too much trouble, whether it was adjusting the menu to suit our children requests or organsing a doctors visit when our daughter got sick, they were always very helpful. We were always greeted by name and with a smile :) A very special mention to ""Bagus"" who is a definate asset to this hotel.

Rooms: We spent our first night in a two bedroom suite. It is a very spacious room, two seperate bedrooms, two bathrooms, 3 tvs, kitchen and lounge area. Huge balcony area with day beds. All the suite rooms overlook the pool area. The bed was very comfortable in this room! The only thing about this room was that there were two entry doors into the suite one being in the second bedroom. For the remainder of our stay we had a villa ......WOW ...... spacious, huge bathroom, indoor and outdoor shower, huge bathtub and best of all a private pool. Its very luxurious and private and conveniently located in the centre of the resort.

Food: breakfast is offered in two areas, in the main resturant at the front of the hotel and also near the suite lobby and pool area.The breakfast offered heaps of variety ..... cereals, fruit, bacon, eggs any way, pancakes, waffles, cold seafood, indonesian choices too.....pretty much anything you could think of. Food was always fresh and of good quality. We had a few meals at the hotel resturant which offered variety by having a different theme every night. We also had room service and food by the pool and at all times the meals were all really good.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it. We will be back!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2057,Don't expect magic,30,June 2012,"First things first: we stayed at a magic little place on Gili T directly before this.
So the Haven is a big, typical resort with no suprises and nothing special.

First problem: booked as a twin room. This may have been down to an error from our travel agent - but inexplicably the hotel didn't have ANY double beds left. Seems weird with a billion rooms or so. They made us pay for the upgrade, after a cursory discount - just to sleep together! Thing is, that's a recurring pattern with this place. The value is not there.

The room itself was huge and really open and light (a studio room). Good aircon. Bathroom fittings were getting a bit tired though.

The building site next door was a friendly bit of company from 6am to about 10pm each night. Helpfully the local builders would shout out ""housekeeping"" as a joke. Funny, except when you had to pay for the upgrade room just to hear them banging around.

Food service was disorganised - especially breakfast. Actually - room service on the first arrival day was good.

The breakfast isn't amazing, fairly typical hotel buffet fare but on the studio side you have to line up in 3 different places to assemble eggs, bacon and pancakes (this means your eggs get cold if you want the combination of bacon and eggs).

The DVD player didn't work (we had a massive day and bought a dvd, looking forward to watching... but no such luck). The WiFi is very poor and cheaply logs you out every couple of mins. That sums up the haven nicely - any chance to grab another $5 from guests seems to be taken. Food was really generic and fairly pricey. With so much great food around, you can either be cheap and cheerful or expensive and brilliant... haven is neither.

Keep in mind the pool photo on the website is attached to the villas rather than the main rooms (although there are two pools so you can walk down).

At the Haven ... the people don't elevate an unremarkable hotel. From the front desk argument about a bed, to the breakfast staff in a daze.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2058,Better than expected!,40,June 2012,"Just got back yesterday from a 10 day stay at The Haven in Suite 917.
Pros
- I was impressed with the suite on many levels. The rooms were modern, spacious, furniture was comfortable and amenities were well thought of and considerate. (e.g shower caps, toothbrushes, loofah as well as shampoo, conditioners and bodywash were complimentary!)
- Robes, slippers and plenty of coathangers are available. As well as inhouse safe.
- No cooking implements (pots, pans etc) are included in the kitchen except glasses, plates, bowls so if you wanted to make your own dinner etc you'd have to request this.
- Fridge was well stocked with beers, soft drinks and water (although I would strongly reccommend getting all this stuff from the Bintang Supermarket just up the road as it will be 1/4 of the price!)
- Breakfaxst buffet at the suites end of the hotel was great - lots of fresh fruits, pastries and juices. Eggs and bacon etc are cooked to order, as are delicious pancakes and waffles!
- Check in/out was a breeze, staff were helpful, polite, friendly and willing to assist with all requests inc replacing missing or broken credit card style room keys.
- Room Service was tasty, quickish but I thought the menu could have been more extensi ve
- Location is fabulous; walking distance to restaurnats, shops, supermarkets, Circle K, beach etc - entrance to the suites is down a laneway style street just off Jln Arjuna (Double Six) with good signage where as hotel entrance is off Jln Legian (main street)
- I used the laundry service outside the hotel located in a shop in the laneway and apart from misplacing a bra, it was 10,000 Rupiah for 10 peices which is WAY cheaper than the hotel prices and came back smelling fresh and clean.
- I rented 2 scooters in the same laneway to the entrance to the suites and paid 40,000 rupiah per day for 7 days - helmets are included but petrol is extra but very cheap! Parking is just under the hotel and is maintained by 2 security guards.
- Located near 2 spas - Putri Bali and Eden Green that were great and so much cheaper than the inhouse spa which is all in US Dollars. For 1/3 price you can have the same treatment just outside the hotel.

Cons
- Sunny areas by the pool are limited as there is lots of shady trees - only 1 or 2 sun lounges actually get the sun and these were always occupied when I wanted to sit in the sun!
- Shower is over the bath and the bath is HUGE so getting in and out is a stretch! There is a pole for you to hang onto (which I coined the stripper pole!) so you don't slip over but if you have short legs, be careful as its gets slippery with any water on the floor!
- Air con in the room was ok but never really felt cold - lowest setting was 18 which I know is low but it just didn't feel like it got cool enough.
- TV reception was very fuzzy regardless of chanels
- Lighting throughout the suite is dim. I'm all for flattering light, but for crying out loud, have a dimming switch so one can choose to make it brighter or not.
- Loud, misbehaved children yelling and being obnoxious in the pool area with no supervision made relaxing hard. A stern word and a few raised eyes quickly shut them up but if you want an adults only hotel this is not it I'm afraid.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2059,Hotel for Couples mainly,30,June 2012,"Stayed at the Haven Seminyak from 7 June to 10 June 2012. Before booking, checked the reviews from different websites and decided to book it with the understanding that it is a hotel suitable for couples.
Stayed in Room 4001 (the hotel has only four storeys) while my other couple friends stayed in Room 4024. Where we stayed was above the restaurant, lobby area and near the road. As you guessed it, it was rather noisy with loud music at night and loud voices from the lobby area.
Avoid these rooms or thereabout but request for rooms overlooking the swimming pool. Our rooms had very poor views.
We had requested for better rooms as we were there for our honeymoons.
Anyway, there is much to see and walk about near the hotel area. As you come out of the hotel, turn left and walk along the shops. Quite a number of money changers around too. Good to walk about to decide on where you would want to have your meals.
Buffet breakfast was so-so and not that fantastic as described in the reviews we read. However, the staff spoke good English and were very polite.
Overall, an OK place but there are many hotels to choose from if you have the time to browse through the websites.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2060,Beautiful,50,October 2011,"Holiday of a lifetime, trip with my cousin, we stayed here in Bali for our first week and spent the second week in Singapore. The hotel was beautiful and the staff were incredibly friendly, poilte and helpful. The street outside the hotel is a little busy with what appears 100 scooters for every car! Quite difficult just to cross the road although security outside are more than happy to step out in the road for you and flag everyone to stop, a little embarrassing actually, yet funny too!! We stayed in a suite and it was absolutley huge. Very modern, clean and tidy. The sun loungers are the most comfortable I have ever tried, wicker with a big puffy cushion! Only a short walk to the beach perhaps about 10 minutes. Local supermarket and cash machine within a 2 minute walk (if you can cross the busy road!).",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2061,Trendy hotel but needs to improve soundproofing,30,June 2012,"Let me qualify. The Haven is quite a big property straddling two roads, the main Seminyak road and the smaller Double Six road. It is divided into three sub-properties: the common hotel with entrance at the Seminyak road, the suites with access from Double Six road, and the villas in the middle of the two worlds. We stayed in the common hotel side.

There's nothing wrong with the hotel per se: the rooms are clean and trendy, beds are comfortable, pool area fabulous. Price is very reasonable too for this location (in the heart of touristy action, 15 min walk to Legian-Seminyak beach). However, there is awfully something wrong with the acoustics or the lack of soundproofing. I can literally hear techno music pulsating from somebody's room (with Adele squeezed in the middle), children and guests shrieking from the pool deck, and from 7pm to 10pm, a blaring live band playing at the bar (I've almost memorized their set composed of Maroon 5, Sade, Adele, etc). I tried getting some sleep before our midnight flight but it was impossible. Every nearby door opening and closing, every furniture moving, every guest walking and talking through the hallway could be heard in our room.

As far as I can tell the suites and the villas do not suffer from this malady, so I suggest you get a place there if you need some peace and quiet. The hotel is probably for guests who can sleep through noise or who love mingling with boisterous guests.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2062,Best Breakfast Ever,40,May 2012,"I knew and heard about the Haven many times, and whenever I went to Bali and Seminyak, I saw this hotel. But, I never thought that I would stay there, because it looked like a bit hectic with the hotel from Seminyak street. As normally I like less hectic hotel.
Anyway, then I had a small trip with my family, then we tried Seminyak, as all of them prefer Seminyak area. We booked for 2 bedroom suite for 3 days.
Well, we came to the hotel, and it was great to have separate Lobby with the normal one. They do have special lobby for Suite and Villas. The room was spacious, huge, we were all 4 of us, but we still had lots of spaces to run. We had big living room, Big TV (we had 3 TV's), fully equipped kitchen, Huge bathroom, and private balcony. I mean, we had 3 balconies. Three!!! And 3 separate entrance doors. So, you still have your own privacy.
Since you are in the middle of the seminyak, do not expect for the best view. Please enjoy other houses and properties roof.
Breakfast, best part!Plenty of food. I mean, super generous food. The do have 3 live cooking stations, egg, pancakes, and even bacon and sausages. It was not very crowded, since the restaurant is special for Suites and Villas guest only. So, no long queue.
Swimming pool is the best place to relax too. They do have 2 swimming pool for suites and villas block, and another 1 for hotel room. So, again, no more fighting for sun loungers or sun.
Only some couple things that we found not really perfect. The Housekeeping sometime took long time for them to clean our suite, even one day they cleaned it at 2 pm, after we called them twice since morning. But they did clean very good. And if you go to swimming pool, and bring the towel to your room, they will suspiciously ask your room number etc. Most probably, most of the towels were missing before. And last, sometime they were not too flexible for the place to eat. For example, I was in the pool, and would like to order food from the restaurant, we had to extra request them to give us the menu from restaurant, not from the Pool bar. In fact, the location only next to other. And Spa staff, if they were able to work efficiently, it would be great!
Anyway, in general, they were GREAT,,and really enjoyed the stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2063,Brilliant - couldn't ask for more!,50,June 2012,"We stayed in a suite for 4 nights and we had the most brilliant experience during our stay at this hotel.

We arrived late afternoon and were checked in straight away, reception wasn't at all busy. The lady who checked us in was very friendly and welcoming. We were shown to our room on the ground floor and were pleasantly surprised - the room was amazing! Contrary to most hotels, the images shown on the Haven website do not do the rooms justice at all.

Our suite consisted of a spacious living room and kitchen space, there is also a dining area which we took advantage of when ordering room service. There is a dvd and cd player included in the room - the TV has many English channels which we were impressed with.

The bedroom is just as an impressive, there's plenty of storage space for luggage. The bathroom is also very spacious. The entire suite was immacutley clean.

We had breakfast included within our package and we looked foreward to it every morning - there is chef on hand to make fresh pancakes, waffles, fresh toast and eggs everyday. There is not much choice in the way of fruit but there's a large selection of breads, pasties, cakes, cereals etc. The breakfast area is rather small and you do sometimes have to wait for a table, but it is worth the wait.

The staff at the hotel are lovely, I have stayed in many nice hotels in different countries and have never met such friendly staff. Every staff member that we walked passed everyday gave us a friendly ""hello, how are you?"" without fail - although it must be said we found that the people in Bali were all just generally very friendly!

Following the reviews I read here, prior to arriving I did email the hotel to request a room away from the construction. When shown to our room I was pleased to see they had noted my request and our room was on the opposite side of the where the construction was taking place. When walking through the hotel, I did notice the rooms next to the construction site and the noise coming from the area is very loud.

The hotel gym is very small, there is only one treadmill and one multi-function weight machine. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night as they had an 'all you can eat' BBQ - we loved the food and well worth the value.

As part of our package we had access to the lounge area, where everyday between 4-6pm free drinks were served with canopes. We went there everyday for our free glasses of wine - we were quite suprised that there was not limit on the drinks!

The hotel is split into two, with the main hotel facing the front (on the main busy road) and suites are located at the back (on the quieter road). There are two seperate pools for the main hotel and suites and two seperate restaurants/breakfast areas. If budget allows, I would definitley recommend staying in the suites - it is really worth it.

We loved our stay at this hotel and would definitley stay here again, it provides excellent value for money as it feels as if you're staying in a 5* resort - the amenities in the room, friendly staff and excellent food all contribute to this.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2064,Great shopping location,40,July 2011,Very modern hotel. Great location in hustle of seminyak. Beware of the see through bathroom door if staying with a friend,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2065,Cool people watching on the deck; overpriced and slow service,30,May 2012,"We walked by The Haven a few times when we were in Seminyak and remarked on how cool the outside deck was. It overlooks a water feature and is an excellent place to people watch. The third time, we decided not to walk by and went in. We ordered cocktails, which were excellent, but pricey and were filled with ice - not much booze. The service was very slow and inattentive. We used the washrooms which were modern and clean - not always the case in Bali. We didn't realize this was a hotel until we went in. It looked very clean and modern. The pool area was on a lower level. It was large but we weren't sure if it got much sunshine. The location, if you want to be in the center of the action, can't be beat.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2066,Easy and Breezy,40,May 2012,"Keeping in mind this is a budget style....
I loved this easy flowing, layed back hotel.
Check in was good, I was upgraded to a nice room. I recommend you pre-check in, earlier than the check in time, the front desk gets quite busy. The staff is nice and friendly.
I loved the pool area, it's uniquely placed at the bottom of the hotel, so although you feel removed you just swim twards the front of the hotel and you can socialize with other guests.
I enjoyed the casual breakfast buffet.
What I liked most about this hotel is that it was centrally located and a very good value for the money.
Be sure to take advantage of their special services and perks...
They have a Beach Club that is free to hotel guests. Offering a great break from the beach.
They have a Special Area catering to guests that need extended stay time... If you have a late flight out this place is a Godsend. For just $25US you have acces to a relaxing area, shower facilities and a place to chill before your flight.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2067,Resturant for lunch,40,June 2012,"A nice place to stop from the heat of shopping and crazy street bustle. Good menu, nice breeze, good prices, friendly staff. We took our baby and the staff made us and baby feel extra welcome.
Shame the smokers are in the front, we got smoke blowing on us.... What you expect in Asia i know.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2068,A real haven in down-town Seminyak,50,December 2011,"True to its brand name, the Haven Hotel delivers a stylish sanctuary on Jalan Raya Seminyak.
Upon arrival, the Haven boasts a welcoming entrance, as the front of the hotel features an elevated deck area, surrounded by soothing water features and a lovely pond before the lobby.

Guests and visitors can sit outside on this lovely decked area overlooking the street which extends from the hotel’s bar and restaurant. This is a great spectator spot for afternoon drink, an evening cocktail or dinner while ‘people watching’ the passing parade of activity before you.

Even, when it rains, you can sit comfortably outside with a drink in hand, without getting wet. I spotted a couple of cute frogs doing the same: reclining here while I was having drinks one afternoon and later met some resident lizards basking in the sun. This was a nice touch.

I reserved a Haven room and stayed for six nights. My room was on the ground level, overlooking the pool. At first I was worried about potential noise from other guests, as my room opened out onto a small semi-private patio overlooking the pool. Noise was not an issue, although I did need to keep my drapes closed when I wasn’t there as other guests walking by would possibly see into my room, if they chose to, though this is probably unlikely.

My room was framed by lovely views of the walled, hanging gardens opposite. The pool was cleaned nightly and the hotel mosquito bombed at specific intervals advised. I never saw one mosquito while I was here.

As is typical in many hotels around the world, I did hear quite a few doors being slammed from neighbouring rooms though, nothing too intrusive, just a tad annoying.

My room was really fabulous, elegant and generous in size, high ceilings, clean and decorated with soothing neutral tones coupled with a cool tiled floor. There was a room safe, robes, slippers, and a reasonable amount of hangers. The room featured a flat screen TV, very comfortable King bed, lovely bed cushions, clean, crisp, white sheets and two bedside tables. Great for an afternoon nap.

The bathroom is lovely and the shower had excellent water pressure with a large shower head. There was also a suite of lovely toiletry products, which were replaced regularly. Two bottles of water are provided daily also regularly replaced and the rooms are serviced to a high standard. Service staff were charming, polite and very helpful.

During your stay here, you will hear the sounds of the neighbouring rooster crowing each morning, a reminder you are in Bali, nothing to disturb your stay, actually it’s kind of nice.

A buffet breakfast was included with my reservation and was excellent quality with variety.

As a solo traveller, I found it easier to eat at the hotel before I went out during the evening, and I was not disappointed. The food was faultless, a really good price for a hotel and it was convenient knowing the quality was there, the environment was clean and well serviced and atmosphere was always lively and pleasant.

I never felt uncomfortable eating or drinking in the restaurant or bar alone, the atmosphere is really welcoming and staff do make an effort to make you feel included. I often had a cocktail by myself, wrote postcards, read my books and just chilled on the outside deck overlooking the street.

I had friends staying down the road at a luxury villa orientated towards couples; who came to the Haven to meet me on several occasions and absolutely loved the outdoor sitting area overlooking the street and the easy, social atmosphere this property has.

Another plus, was the excellent security of the property, including guards and checks. It wasn’t invasive, rather it was quite comforting to know, that my well being was being considered. There is no complacency here you will likely be approached by security when you enter the property even as a guest.

The only downside of my experience was that I wasn’t advised that there was a limit on room expenditure on my credit card held on file. This caused me some panic when I was told my limit had been reached via a recorded telephone message received late one night. As I was using a debit/credit card I was totally freaked out when I interpreted this as being I had no funds left on my card. This caused me unnecessary anguish, thinking I had been victim of some fraudulent activity during my travels in Bali. The reality was the Haven sets a limit on room charges accrued during your stay and prefers that payment is settled when charges reach their desired limit. As this wasn’t explained to me on check-in, I was relieved to know, I hadn’t been scammed. This is clearly a process issue and one that could be better addressed. I charged everything to my room during my stay including: laundry, food and drinks so it seems my hotel limit was reached fairly quickly. In saying that my actual bill was really reasonable and what I consider to be average, so, maybe the hotel limit needs to be revised up.

The Haven also offers reasonable airport transfers, which I used and was pleased that I did, as the airport congestion upon arrival was really chaotic. It was nice to know that I had someone looking out for me who was taking me to my destination safely.

The hotel has an internet lounge with three modern computers for guest use with a password received from reception. Connection is excellent and there always seemed to be availability when I needed it.

Overall, a great stay, a little bit of luxury for a reasonable price, perfect location- walking distance to everything you need. This is a clean, contemporary property offering a touch of harmony in a lively street.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2069,"big hotel , lacking in personality",30,May 2012,"big hotel , lots of walking to get around such a large premisis , badly designed , front desk staff not up to standard , building work going on during our stay , food drinks and lodgings overpriced and the pool doesnt receive sunlight",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2070,"Swish & trendy, but Internet bookers not treated well...",40,May 2012,"Like the previous reviewer, we had requested a double bed and a quiet room on a high floor. We were told that no double rooms were available - but that we could upgrade - for a price. We elected to stay with the twin room and go with the flow, and got probably the noisiest room in the property - immediately above reception with the base throb of the bar music until late, the ubiquitous 5 am Bali rooster (though that's just Bali) and the security guard's whistle directing traffic out on the street from 7 am, all clearly audible in room nearest the street. From the numbers at breakfast, it was also obvious that the hotel was not fully booked. I do object to being treated differently just because we booked online and got a good rate. Get used to it hoteliers - independent travellers book online and expect the best - Internet booking is here to stay!

On the upside, the hotel is delightful. Perfectly located in the guts of the Seminyak action, if that's what you like. Trendy for sure, with a great pool, airy dining room and bar, and one of the best buffet breakfasts we've had in Bali. The (expensive) bar has an impressive full length water feature fronting the action on the street outside, and a couple of confortable sofas for relaxing in whilst people watching - nice! The staff are all young and try very hard indeed to be the best they can be. The rooms are beautifully designed, maximising space and providing all that you'd expect in a modern hotel, with comfortable beds, upmarket shower & bathroom fittings, glassware & ceramics and toiletries. The room design is reminiscent of Citadines properties and, for example, Le Fenix in Bangkok. My wife was particularly delighted with the provision of makeup removal squares - take note other hotels!

Good value at the Internet rate, but disappointing to be given one of the worst rooms in the house.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2071,"Nice place, front desk staff need training",30,May 2012,"We arrived at 11.30pm after a long day and even though I had booked a double bed was informed that there was only single rooms. Initially i said it was not ok but did not get any where, As is was late we agreed, In the morning we saw just how quiet the hotel and upon asking staff they confirmed that the hotel was very quiet.
It seems highly unlikely that there was no rooms with a double bed in a huge resort not booked to capacity. That afternoon our friends arrived and were told the same thing when they said they were not happy they were immediately upgraded and they had just booked that day.

The hotel was lovely and the staff friendly, but I don't appreciate being lied to by reception staff if we were told we had to pay to upgrade I could have understood but to be told point blank there are no double rooms was just total BS they just didn't was to free upgrade us which they should have done as a double room was booked and confirmed by the hotel weeks in advance.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2072,Must ask for room away from building works,40,January 2012,"We arrived to be greeted by a very hard selling asian woman who took us on a bus to our hotel. SHe was upselling experiences and gave us a brown paperbag full of brochures. We checked in with minimal fuss and directed to our room. A very busy building site was opposite my two rooms. I asked how long they would work, and was told 5 oclock. At ten oclock that evening I rang and asked to be moved, with sleeping children and all, we were moved to the opposite side of the establishment. Very satisfactory the, beautiful rooms, lovely amenities, very happy. Food buffet for breakfast was very nice. Enjoyed the ambience and the courteous staff. THey did try and charge more for pool side service when we were paying cash, but the price went down to normal when we decided to us a card instead! THose balinese are very lovely but will try and syphon every cent. We paid $45 for a taxi to Kuta the first trip, subsequently we were very wary and would only pay $5 for subsequent trips. The feeling of being ripped off is not fun! I would stay here again, it was heavenly. The staff like children, so if you have kids, do bring them.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2073,Hiccup at check-in... Unbeatable experience later on,50,March 2012,"Background: Wife and I had gone to Bali for a wedding of a classmate which was Nusa Dua. So wanted to stay in another part before that. So chose the Seminyak area. The Haven was recommended by many travellers and it fit our budget as well. Location is extremely accessible and there are many shopping areas nearby.

What did we book: A Haven Room with a double bed was requested.

Check-in: We were told that only twin beds were available. We told about our request. They made us wait for an hour as they sorted out the issue. We waited at the beautiful restaurant at the entrance, had our welcome drinks. They finally came back and said that they could not get the Haven Room but they would upgrade our room instead so that we could have the double bed as requested. It was well worth the wait.

Room: Clean and large with free wi-fi. The airconditioning was perfect and the bed provided us amazing sleep quality.

Travel desk: They arranged for our short-trips and the driver/ guide was very thoughtful and knowledgeable and as result we could see many places and at the same time avoid the many unnecessary touristy places. The trips were very peacful indeed.

The beach-beds: The Haven does not have a beach-facing property. Instead it has an exclusive area in the beach wherein there are beach-beds and drinks served. Its beautiful as you can just go into the sea and then come back there. They have beach buggies taking you to the beach area and drop off every hour or two.

Breakfast (included as part of the package): They have the breakfast from 7:30 am to 10:30 am giving you enough time to grab the breakfast either in the coffee shop at the front or the by the pool in the back-side. All of which serve the same spread. Its sumptuous and very delicious.

Haven is the best choice in terms of location, value for money and comfort. I would definitely recommend this place for people who shall be spending an equal amount of time both inside and outside their rooms in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2074,"Great value, location",40,May 2012,"Location was great, in the middle of quite a lot of things (bars, restaurants, shops etc). Easy walking to many places.

Only thing is that in the room there's not many wall sockets for our electrical equipment (charing laptops, phones etc)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2075,Exactly as advertised,50,May 2012,"Myself and2 others booked and stayed for 5 nights at this hotel and our experience could not have been better. We were pleasantly greeted and shown to our room which was exactly as we had viewed on the internet. It was spacious, light and bright and very clean.The staff were always happy and greeted you with a bow of the head and a warm smile.We used the pool on several ocassions and also ate in the restaurant several times and could not fault the service or quality of either venue.The hotel is situated in close proximity to shops, cafe's and restaurants and is only a 5 minute walk away from the beach. The breakfasts here are something else.... the food is always replaced before it has run out which makes a nice change to waiting for it to be replaced. The food is always fresh and the variety makes decisions extremly hard. There is something for every taste requirement.A hotel that I would recommend with no hesitation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2076,Excellent!,50,February 2012,"The Haven was in a great location, the staff were friendly & very helpful! The rooms were great. The breakfast buffets were fantastic & the menu had something for everyone. Will definitely go back there!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2077,Friendly staff; Good location,30,May 2012,"We're on the same level as the pool, and our balcony opens directly to the pool! Fantastic!
Downside being that we could hear the noisy party-goers returning in the middle of the night. Great location, easy to hail a cab.
Hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to the beach. The exclusive area on the beach is located in front of the Double Six club (which is now closed) and is shady and quiet.
Overall the stay was pleasant but not sure about the next stay.
Staff were very friendly and always ready to help with making reservations or recommendations.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2078,"Great hotel with lovely rooms, pools and staff!",40,May 2012,"We stayed in a 'haven room' and could not really fault it! We were on the second level ( pool side). Having read a lot of reviews complaining about noise, we were pleasantly surprised that there really isn't much noise to interrupt your day/night. The pool closes at 9 pm and there wasnt much ' party music' to complain about ( as had been mentioned in previous reviews also) The room was a great size, bathroom lovely and mozzies kept well under control, inside and out. The pools are awesome! We had breakfast included every morning and found it to be fabulous - wide variety and tasty! The hotel restaurant is a little expensive, and we preferred to eat elsewhere for other meals - the delicious onion and Zuma restaurants are only short walks away- look them up, they are most definitely worth it! Really did have a wonderful stay here and would not hesitate to return!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2079,Bad Service,20,May 2012,"We have just checked into this hotel after a long and strenuous day.We booked a double room and have been given a twin room since according to the receptionist, a double bed is a special request in a double room & even if we had requested a double bed at the time of booking, they would have only tried to accommodate our request!!!. We were ready to upgrade to the next higher rated room type (since inspite of this being low season apparently there are no rooms with double beds available) but those weren't available either. Instead they tried to convince us to upgrade to a substantially more expensive suite. Very annoying!!

The hotel lobby and the rooms look good but the bar is totally overpriced. Also, there are only hand towels provided in the bathroom. We tried to ring reception but they never pick up and the guest call centre line is always busy. I'm sure Bali is lovely otherwise but our first experience with The Haven has been rather disappointing though we will update our review after our 5 day stay here with more details.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2080,Lovely hotel!,50,February 2012,"I've booked for the hotel room online before my trip and when I arrived there, the rooms were unavailable thus they upgraded us to their suite room located in the Villa area. The Haven Seminyak consists of two entrances which the front entrance is the entrance to their hotel and is just by the roadside, the other entrance is at the back but also the entrance to the villa area. Due to this, they also have two breakfast dining areas.

Upon arrival we were welcomed by the lively ambience in The Haven and the hotel looked amazingly pretty! While waiting for our room to ready, we had our free welcome drinks. It was a long walk from the hotel lobby to our suite room in villa section.

Staffs were very friendly and helpful. They would greet and start conversation with you to keep you occupied.

We had our breakfast in the villa dining area. The breakfast buffet menu included pork dishes. And there were so many food served which really spoiled our choices and I gotta say it's one of the best hotel breakfast buffet I've had so far!

However, one down side regarding the hotel is that there isn't any restaurants/eateries open after 10pm at night.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2081,Good But Not Great,30,May 2012,"We stayed at the Haven Hotel at the beginning of May this year (2012). The hotel was modern, clean and the staff very friendly. We stayed in a Haven room. The first room we stayed in had a balcony that looked straight out onto a brick wall. It looks like when they designed the hotel they decided to squeeze in a few more rooms by tucking them into the corner. I brought this to the attention of the bell boy. The hotel was at capacity that night but he arranged for us to be moved to a nicer room the very next day which was done with a minimum of fuss.

The included buffet breakfast was very extensive- pancakes, waffles, bacon, eggs (fried, scrambled, boiled, poached) , cereal, juices- just about every breakfast item I can think of.

The reason that I don't rate this hotel more highly is because it lacks atmosphere. It doesn't quite have the high quality of an upmarket hotel but it also doesn't have a the character of some cheaper hotels. The hotel is very simple and modern but this means that the shoddy workmanship is very obvious and the place feels a little bit slapped together. As other reviewers have noted some of the balcony doors don't close properly because the recess in the frame doesn't align with the locking mechanism properly. It also lacked those little touches that make Bali so great. No flowers in the room, no artfully folded towels, no swim up bar. The mini bar is very expensive and so are the cocktails in the hotel. It is a good hotel but there is nothing there to really make me want to go back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2082,An absolute gem.,50,April 2012,"We stayed for 5 nights in late April and we were thoroughly satisfied with the suite which is clean, tastefully decorated and comfortable.
The pool is lovely and had big lounges that just made you want to swim, relax and sip cocktails.
We are already planning our next trip.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2083,Noisy Room,30,May 2012,"I stayed 2 nights.
the first day I got the Deluxe room on GF.
On GF Room you can hear the Construction just beside the hotel (almost day and night), the sound of motorbike on top of your room, and people voices outside of your room

than I requested to move,they put us on The Haven room 3rd floor but twin bed.
it's far more quite thanks God. still it's not really that soundproof at all.

the Breakfast at Front restaurant is more complete than the back one.
I love the ambiance and the design. but again not the room.

Double six is just a walk away. turn left and you're there",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2084,"Stayed at the Villa, it was great!",40,May 2012,"What the reviewers say is true - there is a construction site very close to the suites in this hotel. by ""very close"", I can pretty much say you can just reach out from the corridor and touch it!

The room:
Anyway, i can't comment on the noise from the construction, other than i can't hear it from where i was staying - a one bedroom villa, room 605. The villa is true to the pictures, very clean and very luxurious (for us anyway). It has an outdoor shower, and indoor shower, a huge bath tub, and an automatic toilet that is common in japan. For room facilities, there's a day bed by the main door, which we used to gather all our shopping, a kitchenette with a stove and 2 door fridge, and a study table located behind the master bed. The design is contemporary and not balinese, which was what we liked, but some people i guess would prefer the balinese design since after all it's a visit to bali. oh yes, and NO bed bugs were sighted, and the aircon worked fine (there were 3 for the whole villa, all different brands, and we didnt have the remote for one of them??? guess it's on for eternity...)

for in room toiletries where's soap, shampoo, conditioner, tooth brush, tooth paste, a razer blade, and even a loufa - so no need to bring any toiletries along! the bubble bath was supplied with generous amounts (3 ceramic ""Balls"") of bubble bath and even bath salts and aromatherapy! we most enjoyed all these little touches! truly pampered.

The staff:

they were all friendly and helpful and always greeted us with genuine smiles. Guys, keep up the good work. We have truly enjoyed our holiday!

the check-in crew got us our room by 2.45 (as promised, the 3pm guaranteed check-in) and showed us the room. However, no one mentioned to us about the lounge where we can go to to get some free tea time snacks and drinks until we checked out! Anyway, we visited the lounge to enjoy the air-con while we waited for our cab to the airport. The lounge had TV, magazines, and was next to some changing rooms and shower stalls to allow checking out guests to have a shower and a change of clothes before flying off, which i thought was quite nice. The staff at the lounge were very friendly , helpful and polite. I think they were worried we felt out of place waiting in the room, and they kept urging us to have a bite of the tea time snacks despite of us declining a few times (my husband and i were too full from late lunch!)
A lady with excellent english proactively shared with us how to catch a taxi to the airport, for which we were thankful for the advice, and felt very welcomed even as we were leaving.

Vicinity of the hotel:
it's across the road from a mini-mart, and a walkable distance from a little shopping mall that have cafes and shop selling really good coffee beans which they can ground to powder for you (exit hotel, turn left, and walk till you see ""cafe seminyak"" and enter that compound). The walk to the hotel beach is quite long and dusty...i walked onced and didnt bother to go to the beach again (we had a private pool. enjoy the luxury!)

complaints:
The only complaints on the villa would be there are a lot of mosquitoes inspite of the inroom insect repellents, so bring your own repellents. it's the tropics, there's bugs, so not unexpected, but i would advise my friends to bring their own repellents, and use them especially during breakfast, i was thoroughly attacked when i forgot.

Also, there's no shades in the glass room with the toilet bowl...and on a hot sunny day.....well you just couldnt sit there too long. hah hah.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2085,Holiday at The Haven Seminyak,50,April 2012,"I can highly recommend THE HAVEN we stayed for 13 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The resort has three pools two restaurants. The staff are extremely friendly and the food delicious.
It is situated close to everything and they have different entertainment every night.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2086,A Good Location,30,June 2011,"I stayed at the Haven for 4 Days for a girls weekend. We were told we were upgraded to a suite on arrival so were quite excited. When we got to our room we noticed the glass on our shower door had a massive crack in it so we pointed this straight out to the staff. Maintenance came up 20 minutes later and put masking tape over it, and that was the last we saw of them!!!
The Haven was reasonably new when we stayed however the floor tiles in our room were cracking and appeared well worn. The balcony was quite narrow and small, it did not make it desirable to sit outside. The room itself was neat and comfortable with good air-conditioning. Breakfast was not that well prepared but I put that down to inexperienced staff, again it was a newer hotel and staff were still being trained.
The swimming pool was cold, but this is due to the shadowing of the hotel, there is another larger pool but unfortunately we were unable to swim as there were no sunbeds nor was there free space to sit. I asked to look at the Villas they have there on the property and thought they were exceptional, all have their own pool. After seeing the Villa’s I would only go back to the Haven to stay in one of them. The location is great and is right in the heart of Seminyak, the bar at the front of the hotel is great to sit at in the evening for a cocktail however it very noisy as it faces the main street.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2087,"Great location, design, price, all in one",40,May 2012,"Stayed in the Haven Suite, spaciously designed. Staff at reception is helpful in offering solution, and so the rest of the staffs are also well coordinated and always follow up to ensure any issue guests have are resolved. Swimming pool for suites are cleverly designed , covered with trees so the sun does not shine through and you can relax by the pool without the sun attack.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2088,Good For Shopping Location,40,May 2012,"We stayed in a Haven room not the biggest but ok and modern overlooking the pool. Could be noisey if too close to the front of the hotel. If you can book the Villas they are amazing. I didn't see inside the suites but from what I saw they were big they were also in an area of their own around a pool. This hotel is not overlooking the beach but it does have a bus to take you down there approx mins walk or a few mins by bus. It is not in the middle of Seminyak it is just over from double six road so really borders legian and the very beginning of Seminyak central for everywhere as it takes about the same taxi ride to Matahari as it does to Seminyak square.

The service in this hotel was excellent staff very friendly but unobtrusive.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2089,Modern accommodation and very friendly staff!,40,April 2012,"As a family with two young children we stayed in the suites. These were very spacious with the advantage of a kitchen and very well decorated. The breakfast was amazing with so much to choose from and everything was so fresh. The only downfall was the distance from the beach club (which they offer a shuttle to/from) the pool areas were both beautiful, one peaceful/shady and the other more for the sun lovers and plenty of atmosphere (music and pool toys). Every staff member that was encountered was friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend and stay again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak

2092,Enjoyed the stay @ The Suite....Nice Hotel/Suite,40,April 2012,"This was my first trip, hence first visit to the Suite @ The Haven. Having stayed overseas I was impressed with the attention to detail in ensuring our stay with the Kids was a memorable. I was quite impressed with the Breakfast - the decor by the pool - and most important level of respect and such a hospitality, that I am now inclined not to compare with others.

The warmth and respect we received is not to be forgotten. Appreciation goes to the Staff and Management.

Well Done.....worth visiting again :)

2094,"Room is good, Villa is great",40,April 2012,"We upgraded our two Haven Rooms to 2 Bedrooms Villa at some price, but it is totally worth it. Our 603 Villa layout is unique, with one upper room and one lower room, with semi separate private pool each. Bed is comfortable, very modern automatic toilet, spacious bath tub with a lot of amenities. They provide aromatherapy also that brings more relaxing feel in our rooms. The only downside is our private pool is very cold, they should have make it warmer. Next day we move out to the Haven Room because some of our family have to leave earlier. Breakfast is OK. Room is well kept, worth the price. If you enjoy hanging around in Seminyak, this is your place.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2095,Nice Property- Staff not entirely up to par,40,April 2012,"Prior to arrival, I had e-mailed the hotel several times. I received a prompt reply despite the time zone difference. My flight was promptly met by the hotel arranged driver. In addition, I received a confirmation prior to arrival where to meet the driver etc. I very much appreciated a seamless airport pick up after an 18 hour flight. My appointment to the spa (also pre-booked via e-mail) was effortlessly take care of and had the correct time/service. So, even before arrival I had a good impression with this property.

Attempted check in around 1300 hours and was told my room was not ready. I was curious since the hotel was not booked to capacity, but understand that check in is technically 3pm. The front bar/restaurant was a nice place to kill time and they have wi-fi.

I would describe the room and modern and clean. The lighting in the living room was pretty close to awful. If you are trying to read at the desk or in bed, good luck. Bathroom clean and the shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Hotel provides an amenity kit in case you forgot something. Slippers and robes in the closet along with a safe for your valuables. Bed was very comfortable. If there was any complaint with the room it is the lighting and the serious gaps in the door. This is the tropics and and bugs can easily crawl or fly through such a wide opening. Very large deck with comfortable seating. I would like to see some mosquito spray and or smoker on the deck. That would be a nice touch.

The pool situation is not ideal. Beautiful pool and grounds, but most of the pool is shaded by the buildings or the trees. The architect that drew this up and the mgmt team that approved this must be on something. People come to Bali for the sun. Getting a tan at the pools is not easy. As painful as this sounds, they need to get rid of the large trees and solve this major problem. They do have access to a beach club. I was never able to find a seat there...... ouch.

Restaurants were very nice and I found the food to be quite good at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast buffet had a wide variety of choices as did the menus. Nice variety for cultural and diet alike. The service was at times very slow with staff milling around when they should be paying attention to guests. I would not describe the service as bad or rude, just needs to be more timely.

I did manage to use the spa and found the staff very professional. There's a wide variety of services to chose from. My only regret here was not booking a second appointment.

Overall, I enjoyed my time here and if I return to Bali, I would stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2096,"good room, but very poor food",10,March 2012,"we went on a Nyepi gateway last month with the family and end up staying at 1 bedroom balcony suite. The hotel is nice, our room is also nice & spacious since we tagged along our 2 little ones with us. Since it's Nyepi, the hotel have special rules & regulation which we found quite difficult to understand. I'm sure you'll agree travelling with little ones, we will need flexibility on food & dining time with them. It's so ridiculous that during Nyepi day, the room service is only available until 2pm, and the dinner start at 4pm until 6pm & that's it, no food afterwards. We was shocked, I mean what kind of hotel is it where they will not provide food to their guest. Truly an understanding chip is missing from here. No flexibility, they don't even bother to ask when we said we have 2 children & want to order special food for them. Their answer is we running full & short staff. We have to schedule ourselves to get food from outside shops to bring to the rooms. The breakfast is mediocre for so called 4 star hotel, not many choice, they cant even cook up the simple scramble egg with ham & cheese, total disappointment. The Nyepi dinner buffet is worst, the food is awful sorry to say there's no taste, even the rice is hard. It's terrible! Such a shame, with a great location, good rooms we actually don't mind coming back, the ONLY turn off is the food is really BAD, perhaps next time we order a delivery instead. Just to share with you, hopefully the management can do something about this, because is such a shame. Thanks",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2097,"Comfortable, Excellent Location, Very Friendly Staff",40,April 2012,"I couldn't really fault this hotel, I had a very warm and friendly welcome, the room was very clean and well presented. The breakfast was very good, as was the room service and the restaurant. It is in a very good location, right in the vicinity to browse the shops and restaurants in the area, you can walk to the beach too (15mins), but I'd suggest a taxi back. The hotel is run by young people who do an excellent job. Someone mentioned the small gym, this is true I managed to use it only once during my three day stay, and the equipment is first class, would be nice if they had a bigger gym. If I have one tip, I would say get a taxi from the airport office ( 60,000) and when going back get a Blue Bird taxi ( 50,000). Do not let the drivers outside the hotel hassle you to get a car with them unless there are a few of you if so then barter to 70,000 maximum. I loved this hotel, its very good value for money, I've stayed in five star hotels a lot worse. I hope that when I return I have the same experience, best wishes to the young staff and the trainees.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2098,you get for what you pay,30,April 2012,"the location of the hotel is quite good, the location of the restaurant is perfect!!.. front office and housekeeping staff are very friendly, however the FB staff needs more training for their service attitude; most of the time they were busy chatting and did not give attention to my table (noted: the foods and drinks are not cheap for legian standard).
there is not enough socket; if you want to charged your mobile phone while using the laptop and mean your partner will not have any chance to do such thing; the option is switch off the TV (unplug), unplug the electric mosquito repellent; then you can use both laptop and charging your mobile phone at the same time, ask your partner to charged his/her mobile phone on the toilet.
when i arrived; the room was boiling hot 32 centigrade and only get into 26 centigrade about 2 hours later, well you get for what you pay!;.... but the hotel is not cheap for legian area.. not to mentioned there is hardly any parking space for your car!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2099,Loved the suites,40,April 2012,"We loved the hotel and our suite. The location was great. And the service was very good. We enjoy the afternoon drinks and snacks in the lounge, a big bonus. Breakfast was great too!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2100,"Nice exterior, rooms inferior. Good breakfast though.",40,April 2012,"The Haven looks quite impressive when you first step out of your cab - it is fronted by a swanky bar/restaurant which is great for bumming around and people watching. I was quite excited by the hotel and its vibe. However, my good first impression rapidly went downhill once I got to my room.

As mentioned by many other reviewers, there is an entire block of rooms located immediately adjacent to a construction site. You can literally jump over to the new building if you so wished. The drilling begins early in the morning and doesn't stop till 9-10pm. Not good if you want to have a relaxing vacation and bum around in your room. I found the floor of my room to be extremely dusty - I normally like to remove my shoes in the hotel room but had to stick to wearing the hotel slippers as my feet were turning black.

Despite the wonderful exterior, I found parts of my room tired looking. The mirror had a large black stain on it. There was a curious maroon stain near the toilet - I chose to ignore that. The bed was luxurious and comfortable, however.

The was a nice spread at breakfast - definitely something to look forward to and a big plus of the hotel. Staff were nice and friendly - I ordered 2 pancakes and left to get some other food, forgot about the pancakes totally. The kind waiter actually remembered my order when I went back for it eventually.

Overall an okay place to stay - could be much, much better if I had got rooms in a different block.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2101,Perfect Location,50,April 2012,"We recently travelled to Bali and stayed at the perfectly located Haven. We stayed in the hotel section of The Haven. Whilst our arrival to the hotel was not the most happiest it was fortunately no indication of the rest of our stay. On arrival we were informed that there was not a queen bed available and we (my partner and I) had to sleep in 2 single beds for the night and whilst there were unable to promise they would move us into another room, on the second day we were informed that we were in fact able to go into another room with a queen bed.
The breakfast was great - best I have had yet in a hotel in bali with freshly made eggs, pancakes, wide selection of other cooked foods and assorted sweets including crossaints, cupcakes and of course lots of fruit.
The general ambience of the hotel is great but should you want to sit by the pool i would suggest getting there before lunch to ensure a spot on the day bed.
There is a departure lounge situated at the far end of the resort which you can use to show if need be or rest once you have checked out and waiting to fly out. They will most likely tell you that the cost is 25 usd but if you do not want any cocktails or food cost is free.
We loved The Haven mainly due to its location. A quick walk to the beach or in amongst the shops ideal for a relaxing holiday in Bali. Will definately stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2102,Lacked atmosphere,30,April 2012,After a delayed check in we were upgraded to a suite on the Southern side of the hotel. Soon realised why.....there is a multi storey building under construction about a metre away and the noise went from 7am until 10pm. The suite are very large though the kitchen space is largely redundant as who wants to prepare meals and there is no equipment to do so anyway. The room is furnished in a modern hotel style and while fairly new is already looking a bit shabby. You could be any city hotel. The pool area is shaded and may not suit the sun baker but I found it nice and cool after the heat on the street.....however the acoustics were terrible and you could hear every ones conversation including a loud and annoying young women on the balcony of the second floor. Breakfast was OK but the rear dining room was cramped with the cooking station located away from the tables. The rear entry was convenient for shopping and the beach was only a few minutes walk away. Unfortunately a high tide had washed away the Haven beach club and much of the beach was floating in a pool of rubbish on the streets. The front restaurant had great service and a nice but small meal. The Haven served our purpose well for an overnight stay to access Seminyak shopping and restaurants but not for an extended stay. We had a midnight flight and appreciated the transit room facilities.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2103,Not mad for it,30,April 2012,"We had a 2 bedroom suite and it was spacious and well stocked with bathroom products. Staff were friendly and helpful, but can't cater to individuals needs like in a smaller hotel. The wifi was patchy and you had to log on every time, unlike other places I have stayed where once you check in and log on you don't need to do that again.The fitness centre was way to small for the size of the hotel. I went every day and twice I couldn't use the equipment when I arrived as it was full. The breakfasts were average. A wide selection but not well looked after. Fruit and pastries were left uncovered and bugs were around. These could have been covered. The cup of tea situation was not up to standard either. Freshly cooked hot breakfast was fine. I think there are better locations to stay in Seminyak. That said it was a peaceful setting and spending time by the pool was most relaxing.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2104,Foxy,50,March 2012,"Great hotel, staff couldn't have been better, learnt a few things, only use blue bird taxi's, only eat at restraunts that freshly prepare food (not keep food heated all day) my husband and I had Bali belly after eating at such a place, be friendly to locals, even if you have been asked a hundred times to look in their shops a kind no thank you causes no offence. Building work was being done nearby but it did not cause any problems.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2105,"Great location and breakfast, but that's it",20,April 2012,"The Haven has a superb location along Jalan Raya Seminyak. There are shops, eateries, a well-stocked supermarket and money exchange offices nearby. Getting a taxi is also very easy.

I was also impressed with the breakfast spread, which included French pastries, waffles, fruits, cereal, hot dishes, eggs done the way you want them, and even a grilling station for meats.

However, other aspects were disappointing. The room air-conditioning broke down, so we had to pack up and move rooms at 1am. Internet access was cumbersome.

The biggest put-off was the hotel communication. I requested for a takeaway breakfast the night before over the phone, as I had a very early start the next morning. But when I went to collect my breakfast box, no one knew of my request. Seems like one department wasn't talking to another department. So I had no breakfast on Day 1.

The staff were friendly and nice, but there were just too many issues that marred my stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2106,Beautiful place in a great location but a building site next door,50,April 2012,"We had called ahead to say we'd be arriving after midnight to make sure they kept us a room and when we arrived at The Haven we were pleasantly surprised to find that we'd been upgraded to a luxurious suite.

The suite was fabulous - with a big lounge room and a separate bedroom with king size bed and ensuite with a bath. Both rooms had a big flat screen tvs and a day bed perched outside overlooking the swimming pool and dining area.

We could very easily get used to the luxury! Before checking out I noticed at reception that you could pay extra to upgrade your room at The Haven - in our case it would have been an extra $63 per night to upgrade to a suite which I have to say would be well worth the comfort.

The only downside to our stay was that the corridor where our suite was located was next to a building site where workers started banging away quite early in the morning. If you are planning to sleep in during your stay you could ask for a room on the other side of the property!

The Haven is located in the heart of Seminyak with Bintang Supermarket and good restaurants and shops located right on your doorstep.

I will definitely stay at The Haven again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2107,There are better options,20,April 2012,"After arriving just after 2pm from an international flight I was tired and needed my room. I was told that rooms are not available until 3pm! As far as I am aware, after staying in Bali maybe 20 times, almost all Bali rooms open at 2pm. Given I was leaving at 8am the next morning it was not as if I was even staying in the hotel for long.

When I returned at 3pm I was told the room was not ready and I had to wait '10 minutes'. I asked to cancel my booking (I had had 2 much better villa stay offers come in since my booking). The Haven refused to cancel my booking because of the terms of the booking. I said the terms of my booking also required me to be given a room.

After about 5 minutes they found a room for me - a twin room with two single beds! I asked to speak to the manager and again asked to cancel my booking. I was not going to stay in a single bed after a long flight. They then found me a double room in about another 5 or so minutes which was ok.

I got back to my room at about 10.25pm and ordered room service. I was told room service stopped at 10.15 and I would have to visit the Hotel restaurant. I said if the kitchen is open can I pay a waiter to bring me up a meal? They said no. I said this is totally unbelievable and after some ranting they relented and brought me up some noodles.

The hotel's airport transfer rate is 150 rp + +. The standard rate for a hotel/villa to the airport from this area is 100 rp flat (that is if transport to/from airport is not already included which is also common). This seems to me a straight up way of taking money from unwary travelers unless the transfer is somehow superior (eg the W Hotel uses BMWs). If you stay at The Haven just go to the guy who has the tour and transport stand opposite reception and book a transfer for 100 rp (and give some of the difference to the friendly driver which I was pleased to do).

I was tired when I arrived and the late check in annoyed me but the hotel is very clean with a great pool. The location is also fantastic for shopping which is why I chose it.

The rooms were modern and really well done (a bit noisy). A lot better than other hotels in Bali I have stayed at for the same price. This was a real plus. The hotel was also designed well with a modern bali feel and lots of natural light. The spa was expensive.

The only thing is, you can pay a little bit more and get your own private villa closer to the beach rather than a hotel room. I would suggest people explore this option first. I will be next time I go to Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2108,Great value and friendly service.,40,April 2012,"Highly recommended. The location is good, food is ok, and the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. I would definitely come again. We were in a 1 bedroom suite which was spacious and clean. We really couldn't ask for more in this price range.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2109,Great location,40,April 2012,"Hotel in great location, close to everything. Walk to beach or hotel has shuttle. Plenty of good shopping close by.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2110,Safe and Secure for the solo female traveller...,40,March 2012,"I must admit as this was my first time travelling abroad alone feeling safe was my first priority.
My fears were soon allayed by the wonderful and unobtrusive staff. There was always someone around no matter what time of day or night as I was often returning late at night on my own.
Having an inroom safe was also a bonus.
Being fastidious about cleanliness I was relieved to see previous comments on Trip Advisor were true. My room was spotless, nice clean fresh linen, nice neutral modern decor.
The grounds were also immaculate.
Only downside to the trip was on the first night. When I checked in I was told my requested room was not available and I was given a room above the very noisy restuarant bar area. Not much sleep that night due to the loud music. Thankfully it stopped around 1am.
Lunchtime next day I was moved to a much quieter room near the pool.
For the money this is a good quality hotel. Breakfast was good. As for location Taxis were abundant and I could get a taxi into Kuta for under $2.00 Aust.
Would be happy to stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2111,Awsome Holiday Hotel Great location,50,April 2012,"Great Location wonderful For all your needs right at the door step excellent happy staff awsome breakfast nothing was a problem your every need was taken care of this hotel is right in the heart of all the shops and restaurants,but if you do not want to leave the hotel every thing you need is inside.
we will be back next year and will be staying the villas next time we had a look through before we left and they are to die for we can not wait for our next holiday.
Thank you to the Haven and your wonderful staff for looking after us while away from home you make it so easy to come back to Bali.
Ps: not on the beach but they have a beach club and the private shuttle takes you there every 2 hours.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2112,Lovely and affordable,50,March 2012,"This is a very nice hotel. There are other fancier hotels in Seminyak, but this is a good quality hotel and affordable, in my opinion. The pools are nice, which you can view from the lobby. The beach and designate hotel area is about a 15 minute walk but the hotel has a shuttle that can take you to and from the beach too. Breakfast was included in our stay and it was pretty varied and good (I was addicted to the guava juice). There's such a wide array of spas nearby, you won't lack to find a place. Seminyak Square is also a 5 minute taxi ride away. If you want to eat western cuisine, there are also plenty of restaurants nearby.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2113,"Friendly staff, excellent spa, terrible hotel!",20,March 2012,"We booked a suite in the haven, which is expensive compared to other hotels in Bali. Paying $1240 for 6 nights, our room was dirty, full of ants (IN the bed), broken airco...we complained and got other room, which was a bit more clean, but still not up to standard. On top of it, the roof was leaking inside the room.
We happened to be in bali during nyepi, so we had to stay inside of the hotel. Lunch, room and bar service were only provided until 2pm. Onlu choice was eating buffet dinner from 4 to 6pm which was RIDICULOUSLY overpriced compared to high standard restaurants in kuta and seminyak. The hotel took advantage of nyepi, since nobody was allowed to go outside for dinner, instead of making it a nice experience for their guests. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, they give you no value for money whatsoever! Only positive points: excellent spa and majority of staff very friendly.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2114,GREAT HOTEL,50,March 2012,"We have been to Bali about 20 times and found the haven suits, the most enjoyable hotel to stay at, the rooms lovely good size and huge fridge. Thank you!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2115,"Comfortable room, great service and location",40,November 2011,"A recent stay at this hotel (unknown to me) complemented a memorable family event. Rooms were clean and comfortable and staff were notably polite and exceptionally helpful - booked restaurants, transport and a host of other items. It's a venue that I will easily return to and found this to be great value for money. I had booked as part of a package with Garuda - possibly same good value for money with other airlines.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2116,Has a lot going for it!,40,March 2012,"Stayed here 3 nights as we chose not to extend our stay at the hard rock hotel due to not being entirely impressed with it. We booked 2 standard rooms at the haven, and upon arrival were told that we woudl be upgraded to the suites. A nice bonus. Rooms were huge compared to standard hotel rooms and adjoining. Free internet as well. When I had trouble connecting, they sent a tech up straight away, and followed up twice over 24hrs to get it working for me.Breakfast was simple, and basic. Those looking to indulge won't get it here, but it's fresh and tasty. Staff were all extremely friendly, and polite. Bathrooms are fantastic, with great big showers and so are the toiletries they give you. You get proper toothpaste tubes that last a week rather than 1 brush!

Highly impressed with it and if they keep up the attractive rates, we'll always return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2117,A really good hotel in a great location,40,March 2012,"We booked this hotel as part of an Air Asia package, and got a room with breakfast very cheap. I read some mixed reviews of this place but we decided to give it a go anyway. We are frequent travellers to Bali and have fairly high expectations. This place did not dissapoint!

Upon checking in we were immediatley upgraded to a suite, which was a pleasant suprise. The staff on check in were friendly and efficent, and gave us a welcoming drink. The room is very nice and comfortable, and has a DVD player, small fridge, tea and coffe makinng facilities and a good safe. The only minor complaint about the room is that there is occassionally an odour from the bathroom plumbing, but that is fairly common in Bali.

The food in the hotel is excellent (I read reviews saying it was bad and was very pleasantly suprised), the breakfast each morning is a full buffet of of hot an continetal and includes asian choices. The dinner menu is expansive, the food quality is excellent and the meals come quickly.

The stand out things for us at this hotel are the beautiful grounds, and amazing staff. Everyone is very friendly and only too willing to help. All the staff greet you warmly as you pass them by, and nothing is too much trouble. We are here at the moment during Nyepi, and the staff have made it a real joy as they have explained all the cultural significance to us, and have told us the best ways to see the parades etc. Quiet day at the hotel is very nice. It is standard that tourists do not leave the hotel on silent day, but the restaurants are still serving excellent food, the pools are open and massage is still running.

Overall I am very pleasantly suprised by this hotel and would come back again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2118,True Haven in Paradise,50,March 2012,"I Think Chellie reviewed this hotel perfectly. It was exactly how she described it. Excellent service and extremely clean. It was an exquisite and lovely hotel to stay at for our first time in Seminyak. Close to everything we needed. Restaurants, beach, bars, shops and massage salons. If we needed to venture out there were plently of taxis around. Breakfast each morning was delightful and every single staff member on the property greeted you every day. I would definitely stay again at The Haven and recommend it to family and friends.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2119,"""The Haven"" .. Missing an ""e"" for a reason .. Certainly not heaven!",20,March 2012,"We stopped into this bar for a quick beer and cocktail in between shopping. Wandered in with no acknowledgment from any staff. Seated ourselves then waited at least 15 minutes for table service. Once we placed an order, we then waited a further 10 minutes for one bintang and one lime daiquiri to arrive. The band was very loud .. But at least the drinks were cold! If it wasn't for the slow service, this place makes a great pitstop with a fab location!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2120,"I miss the Haven, it was everything we wanted",50,February 2012,"We stayed for 13 nights in a Haven room overlooking the pool. Our room boy Rambi really looked after us and was always happy. Any maintenance issues were sorted immediately ie broken lock to our balcony. The service was all-round GREAT, from reception and bar. Everyone greats you and smiles. The room was spacious but not much space ie drawers to unpack and put away clothes other than the clothes rail, if more storage was available this place is SPOT ON! I will definitely return and stay here. Although not many beds round the pool we used the grass area, so wasn't a problem. Very peaceful when you come in from the outside. I was brought a gorgeous cake to my room on my birthday, lovely touch. Cannot wait to come back! Thank you for looking after us and making our stay so pleasurable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2121,Highly recommended,50,February 2012,"We recently stayed at the Haven for 13 nights, and have nothing but the highest praise for both the hotel facility and the staff. The rooms are spacious and clean with all the amenities (and more) that we expected. The most endearing element of the hotel, however, was the staff--in all our world travels and experiences with many hotels, the staff at the Haven are without rivals. They were, without exception, professional and pleasant. The staff is obviously well trained in customer service and on matters of hospitality but, what really makes it work is the fact that they clearly love their jobs. Everyone, from front line staff to behind-the-scenes maintenance workers greeted us with huge smiles and enthusiastic ""hellos"". The management of the Haven should be very proud of their employees.

I've seen many complaints on this forum about the (included) breakfast the hotel offers. My advice to these people is to seriously reconsider any travels that take you beyond your own kitchen! The breakfast the Haven offers is excellent. The selection is vast, the food is fresh, and the service is impeccable. Not matter what you might be used to eating for breakfast, the Haven offers it. In addition, we chose to have dinner at the Haven on our final night in Bali and it was exceptional. Earlier in the week, we had eaten at Potato Head (a highly recommended beach club in Seminyak) and spent 1.6 million Rp on a very, very disappointing meal. Dinner at the Haven was a fraction of that cost for a meal that was 10 times better.

We have no hesitation recommending the Haven to even the most picky of travellers.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2122,Not bad,30,August 2011,"Rooms are average, cleaning is acceptable, quality typical Bali, which is try-hard but rough around the edges. The pool is small for such a large hotel and getting a spot or a drink is sometimes difficult. Location is very good although the road can get very busy.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2123,Wonderful Stay,40,March 2012,"Stayed for 3 nights at the Haven Room. Room is clean and met all your basic needs. I have a room facing the pool and it is quiet. However, I can imagine the noise for those room facing the bar. The staffs are friendly and the internet is free. Breakfast is good with quite a number of varieties. Location is good for shopping. However, it is far from the beach. The hotel have buses every 2 hrs to send you to and fro the beach. Based on the amount of money you paid, it is worth the stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2124,Pretty Good.,40,February 2012,"Stayed for 7 nights following a recommendation.Had a delightful time.The room was basic but had everything to make the stay enjoyable.Flat screen TV with a DVD player.Cosey balcony overlooking the pool.The rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels,also daily.Coffee and tea makings.They even turned down the bed at night.All done discreetly.The staff were always helpful,friendly but not intrusive.The buffet breakfast was of a good range and quality.Give it a go.We wouldn't hesitate to book back into this lovely hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2125,A great place to stay on a budget,30,February 2012,"We arrived for a stay booking two nights. The rooms are big and spacious the only issue is that there is an hotel been built across from the hotel and work is during all hours of the day and night. We were told about the construction work. I had one issue and that was with the breakfast it was not covered from flies etc so when I went to grab fruit there was always bugs on it, there also really isn't anyone monitoring the breakfast self serve bar and I saw a could of guests grabbing fruit with there fingers not there tongs . Overall a good stay if you dot want to spend a lot of money as hotel is in the centre of all the shops.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2126,Value for money,40,February 2012,"Friendly staff and the rooms are cheap( especially through booking.com)

Drinks & food are expensive ..
Overall 8/10",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2127,A great hotel in a convenient location,50,January 2012,First time in the Hotel and would definitely return. The staff were excellent and the service and facilities were great. Rooms were trendy and spotless and access to the pool from the lower ground rooms was a treat. Breakfast was plentiful with fresh waffles and eggs anyway you want them. Air conditioning in rooms was very good and quiet.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2128,"A Clean, Comfy & Modern hotel :-)",40,January 2012,"We stayed in the Haven room.

PRO:-
- Located at a good area - lots of retail shops & convenient store nearby.
- Nice, comfy & modern hotel rooms.
- Hotel rooms are spacious and clean (not the air quality though).
- Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.
- Price is very reasonable for the room quality.
- Free WiFi in the hotel rooms.
- Good breakfast.

CON:-
- At night, the street is quite busy and NOISY (do remember to request for rooms that are facing the pool).
- There's a mouldy smell in our room even though it looked clean.
- Water leaked out from the shower to our room.

Conclusion:
Very worthwhile and would definitely come back again! :-)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2129,Great...,40,January 2012,"We booked for four nights and were very impressed when we first arrived. We booked a Haven Room and were upgraded to a suite without even asking. The suites are very big and comfortable and maybe could use a bit of work to keep them at a high standard. We had a suite next to the construction site and once the compressor started at 10pm, we asked to move rooms (there is obviously no consideration given to those at the hotel and work hours are not regulated when completing noisy work) and after a few storms we to had leaks (iin both rooms). There were two reception areas, so this was very helpful as one reception is quite a walk from the end of the resort. After being to Bali four times we did struggle with the language with some staff and one receptionist was quite cranky. Otherwise the pool areas were great and there was always somewhere to sit by the pool out of the sun. I just loved the Stone Massage in Atma Spa...we would love to visit again and next time would try and stay in a villa.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2130,Pro's & cons...,40,January 2012,"The suites themselves are great- i had a large corner suite in the back building, away from the works going on next door so it was very quiet. However there was a leak in my room. I waited for maintenance to fix it, it held for a day but then started leaking again. I didn't want to waste any more of my holiday so i just let it drip away. Also, one morning i awoke to no water whatsoever in my suite, so also had to wait around for this to be fixed so i could shower etc.

Pro's include friendly staff, great breakfast buffet, i really enjoyed the food & service in the restaurant also. Plus you get a large amount of toiletries, probably the most i've seen in any hotel i've stayed in. They also arranged transport to ubud for me which was helpful.

All in all a great hotel minus the maintenance issues.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2131,*****,50,January 2012,Stayed seven nights in a standard room. Whilst I was given a room with single beds [although I had requested a double on internet] this was fixed the following day. Both rooms were noisy in that the band and pool noises [not to mention the motorbikes on the main road] were easily transferred. Security screening 24/7 at the front but none at the rear? All in all a good experience. A largish complex kept in good order.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2132,Awesome short getaway,40,January 2012,Highly recommend this hotel. Everyone bends over backwards to ensure that you are looked after. Will be coming back without a doubt.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2133,Pleasant place in the middle of Seminyak,50,November 2011,"It was not easy to find an accomodation in Seminyak for a reasonable price. Haven was among the reasonably priced accomodations. My expectation was not high, but the hotel exceeded the excpectation by far.

Very warm welcoming at the reception, by surprise I was even upgraded to the suite. The hotel as well as the service was excellent. Tremendous suite, excellent room service, quite room, nice garden and also good breakfast in the garden.

The only disadvantage is that the hotel is not on the beach, but only a walk distance of 10 minutes and also regular shuttles. The hotel has a nice beach house with very frienly staff. A staff member gave me also surfng lessons and he did an excellent job. Within an hour, I was able to ride by myself.

On the oher side there are many shops and restaurants close and also Seminyak's party mile is in walking distance.

The hotel does a good job. Many thanks.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2134,Really Enjoyed Our Stay,40,January 2012,"Our family of 4 really enjoyed our 7 night stay at the Haven. We were in a 2 bedroom suite. We were initially in a suite next to the building site which was extrememly noisy. My husband went to reception and asked to be moved to the other wing as soon as possible. We were moved to a quieter room the next day. Our suite was extremely clean and everything was in working order. We found the staff to be very friendly and happy to help out in any way. Breakfast was fantastic! We would happily stay at the Haven again.

If you are considering staying here request a room away from the construction site and you should have a great holiday.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2135,"In the middle of a construction site where they work till 4am and resume at 7am, passport stolen from safe!",20,January 2012,"In addition to the above the service was terrible 1.5 hrs for room service, no-one answers the reception phone, doors and other things in the room do not work. Drinks spilt over lunch and ourselves with no replacement offered ....need I say more?? DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2136,Not what I expected,30,January 2012,"We booked our accomodation through Flight Centre in Sydney and as part of their ""My Time"" program we were told in our contract we would be given an upgrade (subject to availability of course), welcome drink and cool towel, a fruit platter, guaranteed check-in by 3pm, personal call from a manager to see how our stay was, etc. When we arrived in the main lobby area we were told our room wasnt ready (we were a bit early - checkin was 3pm, we arrived about 2pm); however, I wasnt feeling well so they showed us to the Suites area which had a lounge which we could rest in. By 3:20pm noone had told us our room was ready so we went down to the reception, who continued to shout into his walkie-talkie and tell us our room wasnt ready because we were ""really lucky"" to get an upgrade (when we knew this was part of our package). I told him we were guaranteed check-in by 3pm and he said that this would be the case if we werent upgraded (???). We waited while he just kept shouting into his phone and walkie-talkie, without explaining what was going on or anything. At some stage another staff member saw us standing there and invited us to sit down, which was nice. If he had explained our room wouldnt be ready for a while we would've been happy to wait back in the lounge but he didnt communicate anything to us. About 15 minutes later our room was finally ready, we went in and it was exactly the same room as the ones in the main hotel area, albeit not as noisy from the pool. Our airconditioner was leaking as we walked in, so we told the guide. At first he said ""no its not"" and wiped the floor with his shoe (?!?!). We could distinctly see it was leaking and showed him leaking infront of us, which he couldnt really deny any further. He sent up a maintenance man, who tinkered away while we sat there waiting. It didnt leak for the rest of the stay but would make really strange loud noises, but by that stage we didnt bother complaining. I'm not usually that fussy or hard to please (although it might not sound like it from this review) but unfortunately this resort was really disappointing on so many fronts. Our room was enough for what we needed, however it was quite dated and not really clean. The bathroom was actually pretty dirty - the shower was mouldy and the place where you put the soap was gritty and pretty gross. Although we were on the other side of the construction we could hear it quite clearly, which didnt start too early in the morning but would often continue late into the night. In the mornings we were awoken by the sound of plates and cutlery - realised it was because our room was right above the breakfast area for the suites. The breakfast spread was nice, lots of variety and the omelette and waffle stations were a nice touch. The staff (except for the gentleman who was not very helpful in the beginning) were friendly and always made an effort to say hello.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2137,"Good, but with a couple of minor ""buts""!",40,January 2012,"Good location (10 min walk from the beach), clean hotel, nice rooms, comfortable bed, crisp linen, friendly and helpful staff, free internet (excellent!), silent and efficient aircon, good breakfast spread, nice pool, neat grounds, reasonable TV channel selection. The free shuttle to the beach every 2 hours is a nice idea but the area where their ""Beach Club"" is, is somewhat remote and dull. They do give you beach towels though, which is good. Prices for a la carte food and drinks is expensive. Check tax calculations! It should be 21%: 10% tax and 11% service. This hotel adds 10% tax to the total, and then the 11% to the total of the two! Staff, although friendly, efficient and well spoken, operate strictly ""by the book"". Do not expect any leverage for early check-in or late checkout, no matter what time your travel arrangements are, unless you are prepared to pay 80% of the rack rate for a 2-hour late check-out. Buy extra coffee and tea bags unless you are happy with your one complementary cuppa with one sugar only per person per day in your room. The loud ""club"" music (same CD every day) was overbearing at breakfast. Overall I rated the hotel ""Very Good"", but realistically it is ""Above Average"". In fairness, there is nothing really to complain about, but nothing that makes you feel particularly special either.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2138,Average,30,January 2012,"I was disappointed with my stay here. I was really looking forward to staying at the hotel but after checking in was disappointed, not the cheapest hotel and when I checked into my room found that the balcony door did not close properly, there is about a 5cm gap from where the door finishes to the door post. So noise from the pool and outside comes into the room. I was also worried about bugs getting in. When I addressed this with hotel staff I was given the run around and ended up waiting 2 hours in my room for someone to look after it. After giving up and asking hotel reception to advise me what was happening so I could have a shower and something to eat. With no reply I jumped in the shower and then of course the maintence people arrived! Nothing could be done and all rooms are like this. When I spoke to the hotel manager about the service and the rooms he said what would you like me to do about it!
As all other hotels where booked at this time I ended up staying. So many OZs in this hotel you may as well be in Sydney or Melbourne. The standard rooms all look out onto the pool so are noisy people being loud at night and morning. The shower leaked from the bathroom into the room because of the design. Messages left from friends where not passed onto me. When I asked for help changing my flight I was told to call from my room. I ended up going to my friends hotel where they were paying $50 AUD a night and the service was so much better and friendly they helped me change my flight and I was not even staying there!
Free internet in the lobby is good and location is good they are the only positives I can share with you for this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2139,Good if you get it at the cheaper price,30,May 2011,"We booked through the hotels website, paying for approx $75 AUD a night. It was a reasonable price for the hotel rooms we stayed in. There was a bit of confusion with the room at first as we booked a queen room and were given a twin room (we have different last names on the booking so this may have been why they gave us a twin). Normally this wouldn't be a problem but you cant push the beds together as they are attached to the wall. They moved us to another queen room after the second night but we had to keep asking them to move us which was a bit of a hassle.
Food in the mornings was ok, had a reasonable selection, all the cold basics (toast, pastries etc) but not much western hot foods during our stay there. The food in the restaurant is ok, but for the price you may as well head out for a better meal. The staff are lovely and try their best for you.
The driver service is ok, fairly cheap to take you where you want to go but not very chatty :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2140,Construction site nextdoor,40,January 2012,"I can inform you that at the eastside oof the hotel another large hotel is being constructed.
Due to the traffic conditions in Bali, a lot of work is being done during the night, only meters away from your room. It will take several months before being finished.
I thougt you should know.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2141,Great stay and service was excellent!,50,January 2012,"During my stay in The Haven, although it was raining throughout my stay in bali, the room was very comfortable so I didn't have a problem staying indoors and not do much activities in Bali. But what impressed me the most is when I accidentally left my phone in the cab, I reported to the front desk. They called in their superior and the head security guard and took down the whole incident. They went all out to try to get my phone back. They called the cab company (if you were there, only take the blue bird cabs cos it's by meter most of the time and its sort of an official taxi service) and tried to radio into the cabs... Although I didn't get my phone back, it felt so much better knowing people was going all out just to help me find. So, kudos to the service provided by the hotel and security staffs!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2142,The Haven Suites - we loved it,50,September 2011,"This was our first family trip to Bali and we stayed a week in Seminyak at the Haven Suites and loved it here.

We stayed in a two bedroom suite. The parents room and ensuite was at one end with the tv, lounge and kitchen area in the middle and the children were in a room with two single beds and there own tv and bathroom. There was an interconnecting door between the kids room and the living area, so it could be shut off and rented out as a one bedroom room on its own.

PRO:
*The rooms were very spacious.
*The downstairs area were we had breakfast was great. It was near the pools and there was a great choice of foods from fruit, cereal, pancakes, pastries, and hot cooked food. We would fill up on breakfast and not really need to eat lunch.
* As we were in the Suites area, it was more at the back of the hotel area and away from the main street. We found found it to be very quiet. However we could tell that next door some building work was about to start but we were luckily enough to miss this.
* The pools were great, a little chilly!! But they cooled you down on a hot day. There were two pool areas, one near the suites and one near the hotel rooms area and you could wander between the two and use both.
* We were close enough to walk to the many restuarants near the suites.

CONS:
* The pools were not in the sun for a long time - so if you were someone who wanted to sunbake you had to time it right to catch the sun.
* Room service is a bit pricey. We used it the day we arrived as we got in around 10.00pm but we didn't use it after that.
* Although we walked to the beach, some people may consider it a little far to do so. The hotel did have a shuttle bus you could use but we didn't use it. However we didn't really swim in the beach here as we found the undercurrent a bit strong for the kids.

Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Haven Suites. I would stay here again and would stay in the suites (not the hotel area) as the rooms are more spacious.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2143,Would recommend you stay here.,40,January 2012,"We stayed in a two bedroom suite for one week in January 2012. The suites are a very good size, each bedroom has its own full size bedroom and there is a lounge area between each bedroom.

I would say that the suites area has a quieter vibe than the hotel room side of the property, eg no loud music coming from the pool or restaurant area. This suited us but may not suit younger travellers who want ""the vibe"".

The Haven is only two years old but is already showing signs of wear and tear, nothing to be too concerned about at the moment but I would say that unless it is looked at soonish then the hotels quality will decline rather quickly.

I used the Spa for a facial, manicure and pedicure, all of a very good standard. $35USD for a one hour facial and $25USD each for manicure and pedicure. I know that if you go to one of the Spas on the streets you can get spa treatments much much cheaper but I was happy to pay these prices.

The staff are all really friendly and helpful, never did we see a staff member without them greeting us and smiling.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2144,A true haven Ina rainy day!,50,January 2012,"We had a lovely lunch here whilst watching the happenings on Seminyak rd.
It was pouring with rain and a great place to sit, have a few drinks and enjoy the atmosphere.

Nice lunch with a selection of choices.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2145,Water & green shades make Haven soothing,40,December 2011,"There are too many accommodation options in Bali and I chose Haven Seminyak Hotel because of the location. The strip here is flanked by restaurants, shops, and hotels so there may be a bit of noise here. The rooms are very nicely decorated with light green shades: I especially like the showers, and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast spread is good, though I am not particularly fond of Indonesian food (which tends to be greasy and salty). The seating area for breakfast is very cool and gives you an air of relaxation. There is a swimming pool inside, and the water that constitutes a large part of the design of the hotel makes the environment look eco-friendly and pleasant. The staff are friendly. I booked a tour through the desk there, but got a grumpy guide who coughed all day long unfortunately (he should not be in the service line because he seemed so unhappy & bitter). I am always worried that nice hotels in Southeast Asia might deteriorate over the years. I hope this property will be properly maintained so that repeat visitors would still enjoy their stay in future.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2146,Will be returning!,50,December 2011,"We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite for 5 nights during the Christmas period. The hotel room was clean, well maintained. Absolutely fantastic. The staff were beyond friendly and willing to take that extra step to ensure our stay was a good one. Room was cleaned and maintained on a daily basis. Close to shops and a few restaurants, 15 minutes from Kuta, as specified on the website.

Breakfast daily was LOVELY, a wide range of western and asian foods, fruit and cereal also. Very lovely staff in all areas of hotel.

Although there is construction going on from early 8am till about 9-10pm, it did not bother us, as we are aware that something is being built and workers need to do their jobs. Mostly, we were too tired to even care at night as we had been doing so many things during the day.

Only 1 negative: We were told that 2 bottles of water that were in the fridge were complimentary (the rest was not), but ended up having to pay for them..

We will definitely be returning!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2147,Absolute perfection. Couldn't have been better!,50,December 2011,"Excellent service, extremely clean, free room upgrade, delicious daily breakfast that was extensive and varied, lovely restaurant by day and night, beautiful pool with bar. The staff were so sweet and friendly, they couldn't do more for you and awesome location in the heart of seminyak!!:)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2148,Great Modern Property,40,December 2011,"This is a very modern property - i stayed in the haven room was nice small bathroom though.
had a look at the villas and they were HUGE!!! with a large pool.
breakfast here was great with a selection of western and indonesian foods.
great location on the border of legian and seminyak",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2149,Will not return,10,December 2011,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite for the last night of our 15 day trip to Bali.
The noise from nearby construction was extremely loud and continued until well past 10pm despite being told by the reception staff that it would stop by 530pm.
As it was raining heavily we decided to have a room service dinner. Worst meal I have had in Bali. I ordered a burger; the patty was pink inside. I sent it back & received the same patty (obviously just slapped back on the grill) about 30 mins later. The inside was still pink. The fisherman's catch (which my friend had) was nothing more than a bit of frrozen fish and a few potato wedges ( very bland wedges at that). The prices for the meals were very costly by Balinese standards.
We had our friends staying in another suite and when they turned back the sheets it was evident that the under sheet had not been washed: there was blood and urine stains on it! The management did attend & change the sheets and my friends were offered a couple of beers(!?)
They also offered us complimentary rides to the airport the next day.
On check out we were presented with a disclaimer ( I've since seen on here that others were too!) which, in a nutshell, tried to prevent us from writing comments on sites such as this or complaining to Asia rooms (via which we booked the rooms). Obviously we declined.
Not a nice end to our trip.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2150,a nice hotel to stay,40,December 2011,"we stayed for 1 week in a superior room, the room is nice, clean and comfortable. The staff is polite and willing to help. The wireless internet connection is excellent and free of charge.
Breakfast is outstanding and extensive. The location is good with a lot of shops and restaurants nearby.

A losing score maybe the swimming pool which is rather small, shaded whilst located between high buildings. I prefer a swimming pool located in a large garden.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2151,Only eat there but based on that I wouldn't go near the place!,10,December 2011,"Super location with a lot of passing trade for the restaurants, which hopefully explains the terrible experience we had. Our experience included construction workers, a rascist manager, the wrong food being served, an entire course being missed off of our order and a music system that, apparently, only had base speakers.

Normally I would go into detail about what was wrong with this place but, you know what, I don't want to waste anymore energy on it. We would never go back and you can read my other reviews; I think I, on behalf of my family and I, give reasonable and balanced opinion and suggestions. With so many places to choose from there is no reason to waste any more energy.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2152,the name says it all,50,December 2011,"The strip from Kuta to Seminyak is a maelstrom of people and traffic, and we were very apprehensive about staying in that area for our first trip to Bali. But we needn't have worried . . . The Haven is a pleasant oasis where we were able to escape from the noise and hassle.
The hotel rooms are built around a central swimming pool set back from the road. We had a lower ground floor room, so we were able to take four or five steps from our patio door and dive straight into the pool. The room was reasonably modern, air-conditioned, and cleaned every day.
The staff are friendly and cheerful, and can't do enough for you. We ate in the restaurant a couple of times, and had some excellent seafood. Expensive by Bali standards, but probably half what it would cost in Aus.
The breakfast is extensive and tasty. Hot and cold food laid out in a buffet, plus eggs, omelettes and pancakes cooked while u wait.
If you want to stay in the coastal tourist area of Bali, you have to expect lots of noise and activity. Even so, The Haven manages to create a feeling of tranquility.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2153,the haven,50,November 2011,"we really enjoyed staying at the haven. the service was good and lovely clean rooms, the breakfast was really good, plently to choose from, friendly starf",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2154,Great quiet stay for Seminyak,40,February 2011,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Haven in the beginning of the year (feb). We got upgraded to a suite which was great. The staff were friendly. The location is great. It is close to the action but not too close. Bintang supermarket is close, so great if you want a snack. The pool is amazing. It is so beautiful. The rooms were clean and beautifully decorated considering the price. The buffet breakfast is great. love the egg corner. We hired a scooter to get around, you can park underneath the hotel which is great. Room was close enough that we could access the free wifi from our hotel room.. but we were only on the second floor.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2155,Best hotel i have ever stayed in! AAA+++,50,October 2011,"My sister and I stayed here for 4 nights in late October 2011 in a haven room on the third floor. This hotel is fantastic! I highly recommend it! It’s located in Seminyak which has a lot of boutique shops/restaurants/spas. The rooms are very clean and modern. The beds are super comfy, air-con super cold, room service and maids were perfect. Breakfast is great and has a wide variety of foods that change every day (unlike other hotels). We were welcomed with a drink voucher at the bar. We ordered cocktails and paid with our vouchers and found the welcome drink was juice only (the same juice at breakfast). Then we had to pay for the $12AUD cocktails which was a bit annoying as the voucher didn’t state what drink was free...so one can only assume it was a cocktail or beer like most other hotels. The grounds of the hotel are set up perfectly. There are 2 pools. One is located under the hotels near reception and the other is around the suites which is located closer to the beach. The pool around the suites is very nice with a shady tropical feel and we always found a free double lounger. There are only enough towels per pool lounger. We found that if we went to the pool round 2/3pm we would have to wait for a lounger and a towel. We never waited long which was fine. There is a free people mover that leaves every couple of hours that takes you down to the hotels beach club where there are sun lounges and umbrellas and staff that take your drink order. I recommend taking the bus as it’s a 10-15 min walk (on horrible footpaths) down to the beach in the hot humid Bali sun.

We stayed here 4 nights followed by 6 nights at the Kumala Pantai Hotel which is located on Leigan beach just up the beach further from the Havan's beach club. This was a huge mistake. We just wished we stayed at the Havan the whole time as it was so much better. There was only a $25AUD price difference between the two hotels and the Havan was worth every cent extra!

When u stay somewhere lovely like the Havan then go to another hotel u realise just how good it was at the Havan. The pool towels were lovely and new and smelt like fabric softener and u were allowed to take them out of the grounds on day excursions/snorkelling trips etc. The staff at the Havan made way for u on the footpaths and always smiled and said ""hello, how are you today?’. The staff greeted u at breakfast and sat u down and always asked if u would like a tea/coffee. The security guard and hotel tour booking man always smiled and said hello as well. To me this makes a huge difference to my stay as I felt welcome. The rooms had all your toiletries such as shamp/cond, body lotion, bubble bath, toothbrush/paste, comb, sewing kit, razor/shaving foam, cotton tips and cotton pads. Everything you need.

They have free wifi and free internet to use on the hotels computers. I always asked for 2 vouchers for each every day to keep in touch with family back home. The Havan spa is excellent and gorgeous too (def worth a visit). The Havan’s spa was best in the area and was the only spa I actually felt comfortable going to as I knew they used proper products. All of the other spas down the streets are good for massages and pedicures but I wouldn’t trust them with a facial. We went twice in the 4 nights we were there for a facial which was only $35AUD which was so relaxing we both fell asleep (: There is a nice big R-Mar supermarket near the hotel. Turn right out the hotel and it is on the left after the 4 road intersection. There is also a supermarket called Bintang. Turn left out of the hotel and its bout 500m up. It’s a huge supermarket with all food/drinks and alcohol, souvenirs (on the second floor), vegies/fruit, milks etc.

Some tips for the area:
* always get your money changed at an authorised money changer - they all say authorised but try and go to the authorised stores where u walk into and they have air conditioning, tiled floors and glass doors. There is one opp the hotel. Turn left and it’s about 100m up. Don’t go to the next one up down an alley as we learnt the hard way): the dodgy ones are always off the street, in a little wooden boxed room. We got money changed the first hour we got to Bali and asked the hotel where to go. They said turn left cross the road and it’s the first one. We missed the first and went to the second which was a huge mistake. They guy ripped us off $30AUD. We went back to the hotel and talked to reception and the security guard walked back with us and talked to the changers that ripped us off and we got our money back which was great.

*restaurants - we went to heaps of yummy hotels in the area - if u turn left out the hotel and walk for maybe 300-400m there is a 2 storey Japanese restaurant which was great. It had traditional Japanese seating and the food was very yummy and cheap. Our all time favourite was a restaurant called Club 66. Turn right out of the hotel and right again down the next street which takes u to Legion beach. Club 66 is on the left hand side. It has excellent meals. If you feel like a bit more of a walk...the restaurants on Leigan beach are great. Another fave was Zanzibar which has two floors. The top floor is perfect for watching the sunset and they have happy hour 5-7pm.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2156,Loved it!,40,October 2011,"This hotel was the last on our itinerary, after being in Bali for a month we wanted to stay somewhere lovely to round off our trip.

We arrived at The Haven and were given a free room upgrade to a junior suite as part of a hotel promotion.

The room was a little tired but amazing nonetheless - it was actually nearly as big as our two bedroom apartment at home, a welcome change from the small rooms we had been in previously. A fantastic bathroom and shower (plenty of hot water and good water pressure!) and a very comfy bed!

The Hotel boasts a great breakfast with healthy food options for the weight conscious and indulgent food options for the regular people.

The pool was fantastic, there are actually two pools so you don't get the usual pool-overcrowding problem that occurs in a lot of Bali hotels.

We found it a little far from the beach but if you're not lazy it's not a problem, lots of good food and shopping nearby - we'd definitely stay there again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2157,From Mr & Mrs Martaan,50,December 2011,"We Would like to thank Mr Bagus Front Desk Manager and staff of The Haven for a wonderful stay and making our holiday a true memorable moment that will be hard to forget.

We hope to see you soon again and defenatly is worth staying with you Service is very precise and prompt we which is rear and hard to find i work in the Hospitality Enviroment in Australia and i will defenatly pass great comments about your hotel.

Please keep up the good work .

2158,Can't believe the negative reviews!!,50,July 2011,"I'm not sure what some peoples expectation were but I find the negative reviews unbelievable.
The positive reviews are much closer to the truth. Since staying at the Haven we have been back to Bali and stayed elsewhere and while it was ok, it was nowhere near our experience at the Haven.

We still went back there a couple of times for meals and to say hello to some of the friendly staff we had met the last time and will be staying there next time.

We have recommended the Haven to friends and none of them have been disappointed with their stay.

Ok, it's not in Kuta or on the beach but that get's you away from the crowds. You can still walk to both and the Haven has it's own beach club within walking distance. There are heaps of brilliant shops and eateries around the Haven.

I'm sure no hotel is perfect and sometimes different languages and cultures lead to a bit of confusion but that's all part of travelling life. The people that work at the Haven are just some of the nicest, friendliest and helpful people you will find anywhere.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2159,Enjoyed our stay,40,September 2011,"We stayed in one of the Suites and was really happy with it. Bali on the whole was not what we expected so to have a nice place to stay was a welcome relief!
We like others had a problem with the air conditioning leaking but it was sorted out straightaway once we alerted a member of staff.
The spa was fantastic and the only downsides were the bar and food prices and also the amount of shade around the sun beds....not much chance of getting a tan!!
Would be interested to find out if anyone experienced any spooky goings on!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2160,very disapointed,20,November 2011,"We(3 persons) stayed at the Haven for 4 nights in a suite.We were very disapointed by this hotel for the price it costed us.So noisy because of constructions nearby without being noticed,AC leaking and not efficient,bad communcation with staff and poor breakfast.The only good thing was the swimming pool.In summary,not going back again!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2161,Good but not the best,40,November 2011,"I stayed in two bedroom suite but is situated far from the main lobby. Room size is good. Fridge is fully equipped with drinks. Felt like home but as a Muslim, I find the breakfast is the minus point of this hotel. Not recommended for Muslim. Hotel breakfast spread mostly have pork. We ended up in just having bread and waffle. I understand that Most of yo visitors are Aussies and do not cater at all for Muslims. Strongly not recommend for Muslims..",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2162,Great location and fabulous pool!,40,October 2011,"Honestly, first impressions were rather mixed as the reception seemed to struggle to understand our english and we had to wait for our rooms to be ready. After a 29 hour trip we just wanted a shower and rest! We went to the bar for a drink while we waited however the bar prices are really expensive! Our party of five was unfortunately put on separate floors and that made it a little difficult but after raising our disappointment one of our party was given a suite. The rooms were clean and very comfortable but OMG the pool was an absolute highlight! Staff were really friendly and helpful too. The location of the hotel is perfect with plenty of shops, restuarants and even a supermarket and pharmacy only a few minutes walk away.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2163,The Haven Suites,40,March 2011,"I had the pleasure in staying at The Haven in March 2011 and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I traveled with a friend and my 2 boys - aged 17 & 22. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite on the ground floor and just loved it - the boys had their 'mancave' down one end of the suite with their own bathroom and our bedroom and bathroom at the other end with a large kitchen, dining and lounge area in between. We had a great long veranda which included a double & single day bed and a couple of chairs and coffee table - it was a great place to sit and enjoy a refreshment right next to the very relaxing pool. The Haven is in a very busy and central area of Seminyak surrounded by shops and restaurants, but once you stepped into the resort it was extremely peaceful. I'm not sure that the hotel rooms would be as peaceful as they are at the front of the resort. The villas looked amazing and I hope one day I can return to stay in one of the luxury villas. Seminyak is so central to everything, it was so easy for my boys to get in a taxi and head to Kuta or just tour around the streets of Seminyak while we enjoyed a cocktail or two by the pool. We all were extremely happy with our stay in The Haven Suites and would recommend it to others. I can't believe I almost forgot to say that the poolside lounges are the comfiest pool lounges ever!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2164,"Modern lovely hotel, BUT avoid suites on south block for next 12mths",40,November 2011,"First impression upon check in was pretty impressive with lots of hanging plants/ creepers and water feature...

I have booked a hotel room for business purpose. However, the check in staff offered me a suite at the rear, ""congratulating me that I have been upgraded to a suite!"". I thought how lucky I was. After walking for more than 200m, arrived at the neat n handsome suite... But the construction noise next to the block soon get to my nerve. As mentioned in other reviews, the neighboring job site is just barely a couple of meters from the suite. At the end, I went back to reception to demand for a change which they did.

Other cons:
- air con in room didnt seem to be strong
- very long walk from suite block to main lobby
- breakfast food is average

here are the pros:
- very clean and hygienic room
- good location to shops, though not many good eateries around. (avoid both the Japanese restaurants nearby)
- helpful and very polite staff. All the staff greet the guests
- lovely courtyard n pool
- clean environment",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2165,a very nice hotel in Bali,40,September 2011,"I stayed here for two nights with my brother in a twin room. It was a really great place to stay. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. The quality of the workmanship wasn't great there were some cracks in the bathroom. The beds were comfortable and the air conditioning was great. There was free wifi in the room which is always a bonus. The breakfast was nice, there was a large selection and a chef that cooked the eggs on order. The beach club is really just a few sun loungers and umbrellas and clean towels. The boys down there were really helpful and often stayed past the time that were paid for. Make sure you get there early to get the chairs. I found the location quite good...but it is a bit of a walk to the nicer restaurants in Seminyak. The pools at the hotel were very clean and it was lovely to swim at night with all the lights. I would stay here again...got a good deal through traveleasy.com.au - it was a pleasant stay. Also the airport pick up was reasonably priced at $18 and the vehicle was comfortable and you were greeted with water and cold towels so really great service.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2166,Free upgrade on arrival,40,November 2011,"Super up graded room with 2 day beds, excellent suite with separate living area! Awesome!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2167,A Friendly Haven,40,November 2011,"We stayed at The Haven Suites for a week late October/ 1st week of November & enjoyed our stay there. Our suite was located on the North side away from the construction happening on the South side & didnt hear a thing.
We havent rated our stay as excellent because it wasnt but having said that we have stayed in 5 star luxury prior that was well below the standard that the Haven offered. The Suite had a few minor issues but most places do, room was clean, excellent size for lazing about at the end of the day & more than met our requirements (free fast Wifi in the room was appreciated)
Breakfast was included & offered a good variety everyday, Coffee was Hotel standard (best coffee down Jalan Double 6 about 150 metres @ Cafe Marzano), food choice was good ranging from cereals/ fruits thru to great omelettes/ poached eggs & finishing off with pastries if you still had room. Only complaint at breakfast was that it was very hot & steamy when no breeze blowing & all tables were packed. Suggested in comments card to have a couple of small fans blowing in corners just to circulate the air & improve the experience which was otherwise a great way to start the day before touring or hitting the streets.
Actual location is right on the border of Seminyak/Legian & we found it very easy to get around, if staying in the Suites I would suggest you walk thru to the front of the Hotel & catch cabs (Bluebird Cabs, use the meter & tip if you have a friendly driver) from there if wanting to travel North or South. Beach is only a 7-8 minute walk away & need to be careful negotiating the footpaths at night.
In regards to staff this is where the Haven excels, all staff are extremely friendly despite not all speaking clear English, Eva from Guest Services is worth her weight in gold & made our stay very pleasant right up until departure time when we used the Haven Lounge & shower service (after a long last day/ late night flight home) to ensure we were refreshed for the flight home. Mang De the local driver from Dest Asia whilst not a Haven employee is based there & is highly recommended if you want to get away for the day & see other beautiful parts of Bali.
In closing we would recommend the Haven Suites to others, its good value for money, friendly/ helpful staff, not perfect but hey still warrants 4/4.5 stars in our book. Hope this review helps others.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2168,Little Haven,40,October 2011,"After reading previous report one in particular from Gutersloh, Germany. I was a bit unsure before I travelled. From the outside the hotel looks like any other in the area. Security,traffic etc. I was greeted with a number of staff, which continued throughout my stay. The room (Villa) was clean and very comfortable Not to Australian workmanship but still a great place. Worth checking the doors as one was not locked but you should do that at any hotel not the first Itime have found a door unlocked. I felt safe at all times at the hotel. Security was always close. Even when you did not know they were they as another guest found out when going for a smoke at night. comforting thought. Meals were good in the hotel and entertainment was excellent finished at 10:30pm. There is building going on next door which was a bit noisy and expect it to get worse in the next few months as it gets higher. Worth checking. It did not interupt my holiday. The hotel is close to the beach and shopping. The area is much better than Kuta for the more mature traveller or with children. I would go again. Great staff great hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2169,Noisy but nice location and excellent service by the staff,30,October 2011,"We stayed at the hotel for about four nights from 25 to 29 October. The first room that we were allocated was near the main road which was very noisy. Subsequently the hotel agreed to shift us to another room further to the back of the property but unfortunately this was next to a construction site which was noisy throughout the day and early into the evening. I guess it didn't help that the hotel was undergoing maintainence and had a full house as well.

On the plus side the property is located in the heart of Seminyak which is very handy for shopping and eatting. The staff are also helpful and attentive and will try their best to help. Unfortunately, a more peaceful and quieter holiday would have been more welcome.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2170,Quite pleasant stay but didnt feel I was in Bali,30,January 2011,"I would say it was quite a nice hotel. Location was really good, smack bang in the middle of seminyak. Room was plain (borderline sparsely furnished??) and simple. Breakfast and lunch at the main restaurant was good. Swimming pool was a let down, its not for someone who would like to work on their tan in bali, otherwise you would want to move around the whole day as the high walls obstructed the sun. This is a good hotel if you want to come to bali to party, shop, and eat, and NOT when you want to read a book by the beach/pool, work on your tan, and enjoy quiet dinner/lunch.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2171,Excellent service by staff,40,October 2011,"Staff service is excellent. Hotel location is good, about 10min walk to the beach. Breakfast at hotel is also v good. The only bad thing is the noise. As it is fronting a road, noise can be a bother.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2172,"Very noisy room, over-priced cocktails but a good breakfast",20,October 2011,"I stayed here for a couple of nights in October, but moved to another quieter place as the Haven is very noisy depending on which room you have. The more expensive suites are away from the main road so are lovely and peaceful, but the standard rooms are very different, with constant road noise from cars & scooters. Cocktails by the pool are outrageously over-priced for Indonesia (almost GBP 9!) and with very slow service. Breakfast however is great - lots of choice, with chefs cooking eggs/waffles/pancakes on request, plus lots of other choice. Quite a long walk to the beach too!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2173,Pleasant stay but a tad far from the Beach,40,October 2011,"Positives:
- Nice spa-like & comprehensive amenties (Bedroom slippers, Hairdryer, Safe, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Shaver, Shoe Mitt, Shampoo & Bathing Gel)
- Good service
- Great breakfast (though everyday was the same, but loved the pancakes & bacon & guava juice)
- Be sure to get yourself a room on the higher floor. Got mine on the 4th (highest) and away from the main road & lobby.

Negatives:
(x) Air-conditioner was not working that well, got someone to fix it but it was only that much better. Couldn't sleep that well as it was pretty stuffy & warm. Complained, but nothing much staff could do too.
(x) ~20 min walk to the beach! Tiring! So we rented a bike instead. There is a shuttle bus to the beach but only every 2 hourly interval (i.e. 11am, 1pm, 3pm, 5pm). And only from the villa side, so that means 5 mins walk through the hotel to the other side of The Haven.
(x) Noise was still pretty loud for an extremely light sleeper like me. Room not very sound proof.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2174,"Noisy, Bad AC, NO Solution!",10,October 2011,"This is my 3rd stay at the Haven Suite, my 1st stay was alright as we were put on the ground level in front of the breakfast area, noise level was LOUD at 6.45AM, then at 7.30AM, about 3 rooms from us started blasting his in-the room stereo/tv!

My 2nd stay was good, cause they put us on the 4th floor... Until nature took its toll... (The bali earthquake took place while I was sleeping in, which cracked and splitted the structure of the walls and ceiling)

My 3rd stay, as I'm writing this at 2.00AM is going to be a NIGHTMARE! they put us right at the center of the breakfast area, the problem was when we checked in earlier, the receptionist claimed that our room was on the ground but far from the breakfast area and on the other wing! It's all nonsense, our room was right in the center of it!! Lying to a guest is a very unwise and unprofessional thing to do!! I insisted on getting another room, because my wife's pregnant, but he claimed there was none left at this 'Low Season'! So, we put up w/ it! Then the HORROR began when we got in and the AC doesn't work!! We waited 2 hours and still it didn't work! Then it was fixed for 30 mins, until it broke down again, and they cant resolve it! I asked for the operation manager, and came Clive the expat manager and he couldn't do much either! I even requested that we get down graded to a normal room instead of the suite, again he couldn't do much, Not until tomorrow morning! The solution: they gave us a ridiculous so-called portable AC-fan that didn't work!

I thought this was a hospitality industry... Such a BIG hotel, such a great location, but POOR sense of hospitality and service!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2175,Not a Haven,10,October 2011,"Arrived at the hotel to find we did not have the upgrade as promised. Went to the lift and it smelt of decaying food. Was shown to our room on the 3rd floor. Definately not a 4 star more like 3. See through bathroom door, not much storage space. Only 1 chair in a room for 2 people, mirror stained or mouldy, bath edges mouldy, dirty shower curtain and it smelt of sewage. Room was looking very tired. There was aircraft noise. There was not enough sun beds and limited space to sit. It is situated on the main road which is very dirty and noisy. Asked to be moved but they could only offer us a suite at an extra cost, which was not much better than the room. Noisy neighbours. Stayed 1 night moved next day.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2176,Excellent hotel!,50,October 2011,"We have just returned from a trip to Bali where we stayed at the Haven for the first week. We thought it was an excellent hotel- very conveniently located, being only ten minutes from the beach and right in the hub of everything, and also very clean. The rooms were spacious and had a dvd player which we liked. The shower in the bathroom was also great- big like a waterfall! The pool area was very chilled- not too many kids/large families, and the breakfast was superb. We particularly liked the fresh pancakes at breakfast, the free wi-fi in rooms which is better than most of the 5-star resorts in Nusa Duo which charge extortionate rates per hour and the fitness centre. We would definitely stay here again as the service was impeccable and the staff were so helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2177,Construction Site.....,10,October 2011,"It's past midnight and there is no sign of abatement to the construction works going on about 5 metres from our room. Not only is there continual noise (can't hear yourself talk noise on occasion) but floodlights shine though into our 2-bed suite. To be fair it probably only affects 50% of the suites and none of the hotel rooms but it's got at least another 12 months to go.

Fine, it's not in the control of management but it's not even acknowledged by them as existing and the lack of sound proofing and any attempt to block the light is totally in their control and not acceptable for a hotel in this price range.

Other issues:
- air conditioners - only 1 of 3 works properly - and all are excessively noisy
- curtains - only one set of three actually meet in the middle and all the ambient light from the pool floods in.
- you need to be a gymnast to get into the bath/shower
- baby sitting is advertised but we had to raise merry hell to actualy book some - there is only on the books apparently
- it's often not possible to get space near the pool

It's generally a nice place but for the $$$ for a suite is missing the necessary finishing touches. The staff have been very friendly and great with kids.

If you are coming and have booked a suite, insist that it's on the north side or don't go.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2178,:),40,October 2011,"The Haven is a beautiful hotel. Regular rooms are tad small though, so opt for a suite if you want more comfort. The location is fantastic – the beach is 10min away by foot, you can watch the beautiful sunsets and enjoy a cheap but fresh dinner of Italian seafood pizzas. Nearby is also a wonderful Indonesian eatery called Warung Made. Great lamb curries and avocado shakes heh. I also loved the fact that Bintang Supermarket was just nearby. Cheap beers going for just about 1.5 USD were available on the shelves. Lovely selection of cheeses and chips too!
One thing to beware about the hotel is the toilet -- it's basically a glass with strategically printed patterns. Unless you're comfortable with your travelling partner, I don't suggest you share the same room lol.
Facilities wise, I enjoyed the pool. It’s not super big or anything but it is nice place to rest and relax and get a tan or go for a recreational swim. There’s a spa at the hotel and my friend and I opted for an in-room massage. It wasn’t really the best massage I’d had but it wasn’t bad either. It did make me feel sufficiently relaxed and distressed though.
What really struck me about the Haven is how friendly and helpful all the staff there are. They were always smiling and willing to go the extra mile to make us feel comfortable and welcome. They gave us tips on how to save money, helped us avoid getting conned by fraudulent taxi drivers and offered us awesome advice on how to enjoy Bali without falling for tourist traps. Best of all -- they allowed me have a good nights’ rest on my 2nd last day in Seminyak when they took the pains to help me locate (and successfully so) my lost iphone (which I'd stupidly dropped at Jimbaran Bay earlier in the day) even though it was close to midnight! I believe it was this guy called David who worked at the reception at the Suites who patiently and diligently tracked down the restaurant and even arranged for a wake-up call and taxi for me the next morning (so that I could retrieve my phone). I was so impressed and will definitely stay at this hotel again when I return to Bali!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2179,Loud loud loud,30,October 2011,"Although the rooms are nice here and it is a short walk to the beach, the design of the hotel creates an echo anytime of the day. Plus there seems to be an issue with the doors since they are always slamming. It's too bad the design did not factor in how sounds would resonate.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2180,Great apartment in good location,50,October 2011,"We booked 2 bedroom apartment here and it is huge. In excellent condition, very modern and the staff are fantastic. Great pools, great breakfast and in the middle of Legian Road if you want to shop. Would definitely recommend. The BBQ night is brilliant. Overall a great place to stay if you want clean, modern and spacious.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2181,"Great location, hepful staff...would stay again",50,August 2011,"Breakfast was awesome...especially the pancakes. Staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms good size, comfortable beds and clean.

2182,One bedroom suite- book room 310,50,October 2011,"Funky hotel albeit a bit tired. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which is at the very back of the hotel. Great suite, bedroom balcony with views of the ocean (that you can hear in the evening).
Clean, good service, fantastic breakfast!
Great value if you are trying to budget but are use to the luxury Bali villa experience!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2183,It is not bali,30,May 2011,"I was stayed here for 2 nights with my partner. The hotel it self is just perfect but i wouldn't return to this place, this hotel located at the prime location (seminyak) which is not my preferred location to stay at bali, the architecture lil' bit frustrated, i just felt it isn't ""bali"" too minimalist for me. The room just a standard small room with no bath up with minimalist interior (again). Food is so so, pool just ok but lil' bit small. Maybe i would like to return to this hotel just if they were not in bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2184,2nd time round!,40,September 2011,This is the second time we have visited the Haven! We have found the hotel to be exceptionally clean and staff very friendly. We absolutely love the buffet breakfast in particular the pancakes! It is a great location and there are many shops and good restaurants nearby. It is also very reasonably priced unlike many other places in Seminyak! We have been very happy with both of our stays!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2185,Enjoyable stay with The Haven,50,September 2011,"Stayed with The Haven for 4d3n in a normal deluxe room, and we really enjoyed our stay overall. The resort is clean and new, staffs are helpful and friendly. Worth the $108 per night booked from Expedia.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2186,"Great Location, friendly service",50,May 2011,"Nice Hotel, great Pool, perfect location, clean room staff friendly and helpful",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2187,Great location!,40,September 2011,"We booked the Haven after deciding on a last minute trip to Bali. We read up on tripadvisor and I can happily say that we had a great trip! None of the bad experiences that other people reported regarding noise, theft, mosquitoes, mouldy bathrooms and poor breakfasts etc happened to us. In fact we found the staff to be very honest, friendly and helpful, the room lovely and mosquito free, and the breakfast fantastic!! We never had difficulty in getting a lounge-chair by the pool and so didn't make use of the shuttle service to the beachclub. The pool can be shaded at times, but there is plenty of sun and a choice of pools. We had a room at the back of the property and so it was very quiet. The location is great for shopping and the large Bintang supermarket is just minutes away. It only cost us around two or three dollars to get up to the very top of Seminyak to visit places like potato head or to the very heart of Kuta. We visted the dayspa whislt there for a three-hour indulgence package and it was a highlight of our trip, a must do! The only downside was the speed of the wifi connection, but this is not just at the Haven. I would reccommend this hotel to anyone.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2188,Never to return!,10,August 2011,"In late July we negotiated a bed and breakfast package for 4 adults and 2 young children for 10 nights in a suite - 27.5m Rp, paid in advance. On the 3rd day we were told that the roll away bed was not included in the package and a request for an additional 4.38m Rp was aggressively made. After many hours of discussion with a MANAGER, we were not making progress and decided to request a refund and leave. This was met with silence and a lack of understanding, but a settlement of 0.438m Rp appeared to resolve the matter. We believed that this matter would be best closed and that we could get on with our holiday if we settled the account immediately. Alas, the account also included international phone calls which had not been made. Account settled, no!!, Day 5, we were told aggressively that the childrens’ breakfasts were also not included and that we must pay half price for 10 breakfasts. Once again many hours later, following discussion with a person who claimed Manager status, this matter was resolved. It was evident now that the package was not acceptable to the HOTEL MANAGEMENT, pressure being applied to desk staff to continually attempt to confuse us with very inadequate computer generated accounts. On the last night we requested a copy of our account which should not have included any accommodation costs. Once again we were confronted with another account for 1 Room for 1 night totalling 2.15m Rp and other charges totally over 5m Rp. We reached agreement after 1.5 hours that the original package should stand and restaurant expenses of 2.73m Rp would be paid by us on check-out. However, on check-out another account for the 2.15m Rp appeared. After more than 2 hours of discussion with 3 Managers, luggage impounded and physical restraint from leaving the Hotel, we felt so frustrated and confronted that we made an offer of 1m Rp. But that's not the end!!! The Visa slip was held on the table for signature, 1.68173m Rp to which I strongly objected and had to insist on cancellation before I would sign the replacement for the agreed amount. However, the integrity and honesty of the Management of this Hotel is not reflective of the staff overall. We have visited Bali numerous times and wished to share our fascination with our family - THE HAVEN will not be included in future sharing of that fascination.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2189,Best Hotel in Kuta,50,September 2011,"We checked into The Haven after spending a week and half elsewhere in Northern Bali and Nusa Lembongan. Upon checking in, the staff member apologized for the construction that I had not noticed (and never did), and advised us he had upgraded our room as a result.

We had booked a Standard room, and were upgraded to a suite. Lovely. Fantastic living room complete with TV/Stereo (DVD upon request), full kitchen and fullsized fridge/freezer. The bathroom featured a tub/shower combo with good water pressure (hot water takes a while to get going, but once going is endless), huge mirror/counter, and lots of storage. The bedroom was lovely. Huge king sized bed, tv, sliding doors to the deck, and clean, comfortable linens. The deck ran the considerable length of the suite, complete with sitting area on one end and a day bed on the other. Our room (403) looked over the pool and retaurant. They also provided turndown service, which was unique in the 8 hotels we stayed at in Bali.

The hotel was almost empty, which probably contributed to the upgrade, but once word gets out it will not be. Great location right on the shopping street, and a 15-20k ride to Kuta (1.50-2 dollars). Fantastic restraurant (try the lasagna at Lemon Cello... one of the best I've ever had). The breakfast (included) was a buffet and the food quality was better than any other a la carte breaky I had elsewhere. The grounds are beautiful and tranquil. Two pools, lots of loungers, and plenty of pool staff (including a bar).

The staff were exceptionaly friendly and helpful. Nothing I asked for was refused or created a hassle.

It is difficult to achieve Western standards in Bali, but The Haven managed to do this. All hotels there should model their service and accomodations after The Haven.

Exceptional in every way.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2190,Great value if you get an online deal,40,September 2011,"Booked the Haven as a treat after some very basic travelling in Flores and it was bliss. The beds are probably the best thing about the Haven. Rooms are v comfortable in general. We had a room which looked out on to a garden which was very private, then moved the following day to a room overlooking the pool which was not private at all - didn't mind but would prob be worth a note here that the rooms on the ground floor facing the pool are very noisy and not at all private if that kind of thing bothers you - the main walkway through the hotel passes in front of those rooms. Staff are very friendly but service can feel slow and clunky in what is selling itself as a more upmarket hotel. Location is fab, with cheap and yummy Warung Murah on the way to the beach and the loads of boutiques if you turn left out of the hotel towards Seminyak proper.

We got a cheap deal on Agoda for around $50 but the desk rate is $200 - no bargaining even in low season! - so this is definitely worth booking online.

The travel kiosk on the corner if you turn right out of the hotel (literally on the corner of the next road) is a real gem - they are super helpful and they do promo rates with Wahana speedboats to the Gilis where you can ""buy one and get one free"" - either a one way for two people or a open return for one. Yes we thought it was a scam too (having been ripped off loads on the trip in Indo so far) but it was genuine and the boat was much more comfortable and professional than the Sea Marlin we booked for the trip back to Bali from the Gilis.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2191,Great for hotel style rooms in Seminyak,30,April 2011,"The Haven has lovely pool areas and a really good location in Seminyak. We utilised the complimentary internet kiosk and the sun lounges at The Haven's special area on the beach (a ten minute walk away). We were told that we'd been upgraded to a suite though it didn't appear special in any way, just a nice clean room, nothing fancy. Disappointed that the free wi-fi never seemed to work on our iphones because we were too far from the network at the front hotel area and the network for the suites didn't work in our room. In a complex this big, you don't feel like you're in a luxury boutique suite by any means but it's a great location and has a nice bar on the street front that is attractive and makes a good place to meet people. Drinks here are expensive though by Bali standards. We stayed for 5 nights and by that time we were ready to move onto a smaller villa for a bit more chill out time. I would return to The Haven though to be close to the action of Seminyak but I'd just make it a shorter stay next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2192,Close to all the busy stuff in Bali,30,November 2010,This hotel should tick all the boxes. Its clean and modern. It felt a little too sterile for me but if you are looking for something 'in the thick of it' then its a good choice. The pool was closed for cleaning when we were there which was annoying.. and there was road works on the street which meant that breakfast was not very calm - however I guess that's not the hotels fault. Had a walk down to the villa area and that looked great.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2193,"Better call iit ""The Hell""",10,September 2011,"During our stay on Bali in the beginning of September 2011 my wife and I stayed at the Haven. We started to plan out our Holiday several months ago and did a thorough analysis of possible hotels in Seminyak. We read several trip advisor postings and also took a look at the internet web page. The Haven´s web page looks amazing and promising and is the complete opposite of what it turned out to be. Also several postings were not really promising but somehow we thought that the internet appearance could not be that fake.

So on September 3, we arrived at approximately 1.30 pm and at the reception we have been told that we had to wait until 3 pm until official check in time, as our room was not ready yet. But the receptionist promised that he would do his utmost to fasten the process to get our room cleaned. Already at check in, we have been welcomed by a letter stating that in order to „keep the safety and convenience of the other in-house guests“ the Haven „forbids any of the in-house guests to carry any Toys Gun or Weapons into the guest rooms or upon entering the other guest facility“. They offer „ safety storage at the Security department which you may collect any time you want to use this outside of the Hotel“. Moreover it is not allowed to „entertain any private alcoholic and drugs tic party inside the guestroom“. They „provide BAR and lounge facilities ant SABEEN and LEMONCELLO, should you wish to enjoy drink arrangement with your partners during the stay“. This information gave already a very weird feeling which has been underlined by a male person that was smoking a joint and was walking past the lobby towards the guestrooms.

By looking around the facility we saw that the promising website was far from what was and is reality. There was dirt everywhere and the furniture at the restaurant was partially worn and the carpet was torn and had holes and stains. A larger part of the clientele was middle-aged Surfers, who did not want to stay at one of the youth hostels, but were willing to pay more. And this is what the hotel is in reality – a better youth hostel, without bunk beds and a kitchen where you prepare your own food.

We had lunch at the restaurant, in which we had to move seats, as at the first table we have been ignored successfully for at least 10 Minutes. Around 3.25 pm my wife walked up to the reception as we saw all the guest receiving room keys. We finally received our room key and have been told that our room would be on ground level. We immediately wanted to change the room as we have read on trip advisor that guests have been robbed. But unfortunately there would only one room be left, but that would have twin beds and they assumed that we would not like to have that.

So finally arriving at our room, we were shocked. There was a strange and an undefined smell in the room. At a glance the room was ok, but taking a closer look it was dirty. Hairs everywhere, in every corner, even at the walls in the bath room. Mold was in the shower and on the floor in the toilet. Even excreta from animals or something similar we found on the floor. But then my wife walked to the door facing the pool. It was not even closed and everybody would be able to enter the room without even needing to break in. So the question came up…if housekeeping cleans the room, while we are out and forgets again to close the door…what would be left in the room when we would come back? Even when closing the door, you could easily pull back the door, so that it would be easy to open the lock and enter the room.

We could not possibly stay at this room. We did not feel safe at all…so we went up the reception again and told them that we would check out, as they were fully booked and would not be able to give us an alternative. The manager on duty wanted to talk to us and try to find a solution. They suggested an upgrade to a suite that would be in another building of the hotel – at a supplement of only $65 per night. Do they really think that we would pay 100% more than initially booked, only to feel safe? Shouldn´t safety be a given fact as it’s one of our basic needs? So we declined the offer and wanted to check out.
However checking out was another hassle. They wanted us to sign an agreement, stating that we were “unhappy” with the room and “that we would not make any refund and complaint against the Haven Seminyak “, our travel agent or other media. Do they really think that anybody would sign this? So after a long discussion which took more than 30 minutes we were allowed to cross out what we wanted and left the hotel.
The promises on the Haven´s Website probably are the biggest lies that we have ever encountered. It was loud, noisy, unsafe and it smelled. Maybe staying in a suite or any other higher category can be an option, but not for us.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2194,Good Choice for Seminyak,40,August 2011,"Decent rooms & central location in Seminyak. About 10 min walk from the beach.
We found the staff very polite and helpful at all times. Good breakfast, complimentary wi-fi.
I have only two negative comments; first one is although check out time is 12:00, our room was not ready until 15:00 - after a long flight, the last thing you want is to hang around in the lobby waiting for your room to be ready. Secondly, for some reason, we noticed that it took them quite a long while to clear away dirty plates left by the doors after some other quests room service - we thought it would attract all sorts of bugs in such hot weather.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2195,Great Hotel Excellent Value and Location,40,August 2011,"Stayed here for my first trip back to Bali in years. I was lucky to be upgraded to a Suite and it was lovely, the facilities, balcony overlooking the pool, the room amenities and fixtures and fittings were first class. The location is nice with many great restaurants and spas within walking distance so you can always pop out to get a coffee some supplies etc. Breakfast was good overall as was the staff service. The only gripe with the room was the water pressure for the shower which was pretty dismal, it is meant to be a rain type head but its only a very light drizzle that you get. Seriously this needs to be addressed since after a hot day at the beach you need to be able to get clean with a nice refreshing shower. The swimming pools were a bit cold for my liking and the loud music by the main pool could have been turned down. These are just minor observations although the shower was an annoyance. Overall this is an excellent hotel well located with friendly staff and a modern ambiance excellent for couples of families, and at the rate I found it was very good value. Would highly recommend, also has good quality and fast free internet access throughout the hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2196,People Friendly Hotel,50,August 2011,"Stayed 11 nites at The Haven late August. It was truly the best experience we have had. the staff were all just simply the best. The Hotel comlex was great with room type or suite or villa accommodation. We stayed in a Suite and it exceeded our expectations. Truly people friendly from the very first day to out last which was so sad to leave. We felt comfortable, safe, and relaxed, especially from all the hustle and bustle out on the streets. We thoroughly recommend this hotel for first time travellers to Bali and perhaps those that like to relax and unwind more than be entertained inside a hotel complex. Keep uo the good work 'The Haven' because whatever you are doing from management to the hard working staff, you are doing a great job. Regards John and Marita Jackson room 209.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2197,very dissapointed,10,August 2011,"I had booked 5 nights to stay at the haven from the 27th August till the 1st of september. The night before I was due leave, for unforseen circumstances I was unable to travel. I called the hotel immediently to see if I could move my dates after being on hold for around 10 mins it became clear they could not find anyone to speak to me and I was told to send an email. I sent an email explaining my situation and requesting if I could change my travel dates. The response was the hotel is fully booked and they would not/could not do anything for me. i checked there website and lastminute and there were rooms available on both sites. I asked if we could work something out perhaps my stay in September could be for a reduced amount? to this response i got no reply! I understand the terms of my booking, but considering there were rooms available not only on there site but they were advertisong rooms on an external site at the time I was suppoes to be staying, there were obviously many rooms available at the hotel and I had not caused them to lose bookings. I fell it may have been reasonable to discuss and for them to consider my request, instead my email was ignored.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2198,Amazing Hotel and friendly staff!,50,August 2011,"My partner and I booked The Haven for 9 nights, our first holiday in Bali. The reviews suggested it was well located, and it certainly was (close to many shops, Bingtang market). Check in was efficient and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The buffet breakfast had a lot of delicious choices leaving us full every morning! We loved the pool and the decking area to relax and soak up the sun, although a part of it was shaded from the building. Our room was immaculate and when ever we needed anything staff were attentive. Customer service was excellent! Thank you for making our stay such a lovely experience!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2199,Friendly.,40,August 2011,"Pros: We were upgraded to a junior suite so it was nice :)) It was very spacious, with big bathtub and big shower area. Complimentary internet. Good breakfast (hot dishes, fruit, bread, pancakes and wafers etc.). Clean. Friendly and helpful staff.

Cons: Extremely noisy neighborhood. Shuttle service to the beach club operates only if there are free places in the club - and there are only about 20 of them (?). Very small pool area. If you have your room in the front side of the hotel, be prepared for some noise in the evening - music form the restaurant (but it usually ends before midnight). You can't swim in the pool in the evening.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2200,Would find elsewhere next time,20,August 2011,"I have just stayed at the Haven and apart from very comfy beds, there is nothing that would bring me back. Very little seating around a pool that had absolutely no atmosphere and i could buy cheaper drinks in Australia! While I was at the counter there were several people who had issues with pricing of rooms and what they were charged, why a company would tell a patron to run along and book a room on the internet because they would not match the price is a staggering insult to the guest. I was quite amazed by this attitude. In general, if you do want to chill out at the pool bar, do not stay here, there are better places with more atmosphere and less hassles.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2201,Noisy and poor hotel management,20,August 2011,"I book the room through a booking website, and we I arrived hotel I been told they have only room with twin bed available! And after I check in, I notice the room has only shower but no bath tub, so I insist that I prefer a room with bath tub , they told me to wait for an hour ( it was 2 pm ) . After I went shopping and spa and came back hotel at 6 pm, the reception told me the room was not ready due to the last guest 's late check out. When I finally got my room at 8 pm, the twin bed was hard as a wooden bed, its very uncountable and small, I couldn't sleep well even I was extremely tired. The next day, I moved to a room with double bed after 2 hours talking with the different receptionists / manager ( I called 3 times and all answers I got were asking me to wait for them to call back but they never call me back ) , and finally I got into the room with double bad, but the rom is located above the bar / restaurant which plays lord music all night till 2 am daily( lady gaga and all dance music ) and even the street noise is big problem too.

The hotel is new and bright, the pool and amenities are good. But be aware of the noise and also never stay in the twin room as its the most uncomfortable bed I ever sleep on.

The receptionist has big problem in managing the room as I always seen guest waiting at the reception for rooms even in late afternoon or auguring for the room type.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2202,Such an indifference,10,August 2011,"Wow we arrived and it all looked impressive. We attended the hotel for a 3 day business meeting with my team. A time to relax and discuss the year ahead. The standard rooms where quite small so we asked for an upgrade on one of the 4 rooms we had booked to allow us to stay within the hotel and access a meeting table. A suite was offered (1 bedroom) with an upgrade price of $350USD per night. I thought expensive and asked if there was a cheaper alternative. This was the next upgrade option supposedly and served our purpose so I took it. Nice room, very small for an overall cost of $500USD per night though I thought. (and of course quoted in USD and charged in Rupiah at a considerably reduce ""hotel"" exchange rate)

The story continues....We had last night a 2.00am departure so I asked for an extension to one of the smaller rooms so we could leave our bags and shower before departing. They would not offer this as complimentary, even though I had just spent around $4000USD overall in 3 1/2 days. They said the rate was $175USD. One of my colleagues stated that we could get an internet rate far cheaper and infact the hotel confirmed that they where charging me for a full nights rent at ""RACK"" rate. I suggested that as an existing customer surely they could match the internet rate. They said no they where not prepared to do that and the rate was fixed at $175. If I wanted a cheaper rate I would have to book on the internet then. I debated this lunacy as I was standing in front of them and was prepared to pay directly to them rather than they loose money to commission and that I was also prepared to pay slightly higher. They flatly refused and said I should book on the internet then..... What ever happened to customer service and retention of customers.... I got back to my room to get my iPad and the phone was ringing the front desk suggested they would now match the internet rate @ $115USD. I said great and would come back to pay directly (its like bartering on the street really) I thought bugger this though I would check the internet rate as they said they would match it, I found AGODA was at $89USD, including breakfast which I would not need of course as I was leaving at midnight. On suggesting this back at the front desk I was told they could not honour that price and I should book on the internet... I asked for the manager as this was getting ridiculous. The manager took some time and whilst I was sitting waiting I browsed WOTIF and found that the hotel suite I paid $500USD per night was actually listed as $210USD. You could image my disgust at paying so much as an existing customer, when the internet offered a new customer a 58% discount. The manager tried to explain that internet rates where different... and that they where full when I booked the upgrade.....and hence the extra rip off, but please.

I ended up paying $115 for the extra 5 hours for the smaller room to shower in( only after the front desk on departure not wanting to honour the agreed $115 and tried billing me the rack rate of $175 again. And then accepting the lesser amount after much argument and then giving me a credit card slip to sign with the full $175 still on it (the cheeky b*****d)

In the end much more happened during our 3 1/2 days but the hotel staff overall where fantastic and Putri on the front desk also, but the Management\Accounting\Sales and front desk staff need to be shot. What has happened to customer service/Retention of customers/Repeat business, rather than hungry for that extra few dollars once off.

I will devote the equivalent amount of my consulting time, as the money I have been ripped off at this hotel to make sure other patrons are warned about the actual indifference shown to its existing customers. In the end buyer beware.... buy off Wotif or Agoda etc rather than stand in front of the hotel desk and buy direct… What Lunacy",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2203,OK BUT HAD SOME ISSUES,30,August 2011,"We stayed in a 2 bedrooom suite (2 couples) and because we experienced problems at check in we were concerned that we may have made a bad choice in accommodation. We were told that only one bedroom and living area were available for the 3:00 p.m. checkin and that the other bedroom wouldn't be available until 7:00 p.m. that evening (due to guests require late check out). At first we didn't mind but after waiting approximately 40 minutes and dealing with four different checkin staff we advised that that this was unacceptable. Fortunately a 2 bedroom suite was found before we really lost our patience. The staff at the Haven were very helpful, great facilities, nice breakfast and comfortable beds, however the rooms are in need of maintenance (cracked tiles, stains on the benches etc). The two different receptions (Hotel & Suites) make it confusing when advising drivers or tour companies where to pick up etc.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2204,Great value for money :),50,August 2011,"Booked this hotel through booking.com and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of facilities and service compared to the price range. I'm sitting in the hotel room as I type this ;) Great staff, good breakfast and excellent location. This is our first time in Bali and the first leg of the trip is Seminyak. I absolutely understand why people keep coming back to this area. Bali and it's people resonate charm like no other place I've been to. Am definitely hooked :D",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2205,"Location , location, location",50,July 2011,"We stayed at the Haven for 2 weeks, with close friends and there family,ranging in age from 18 to 50. The location is so close to every thing,walking distance to shops, beach and restaurants,The breakfast in the main restaurant was fantastic and catered to every ones taste. If you want a relaxing place to lay by the pool then go to the back entrance pool ,double day beds that we spent meny hours lazy on, sipping cocktails or having a light snack before or after a massage at the local spa Sanda which was just to the right leaving through the back enterance.There is a spa at the resort which looked amazing but little expensive when you can gey full body massage for Aus$7.00 just outside the resort,my husband and I had a treatment at Sanda every second day all treatments were amazing.
Could go on and on great medium priced Resort, rooms were clean and lge ,bed was very comfortable.Staff were very helpfull tourist desk man forgotten his name went above and beyond duty nothing was to much.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2206,A home away from home,50,July 2011,"After having decided to spend a month abroad I was determined to find a place where I would feel comfortable, at ease and safe. I discovered that The Haven was able to cater to these three needs.

The hotel is pleaseantly located in the heart of Seminyak, having shops, convenience stores, restaurants and nightlife facilities closeby. Though located on busy and sometimes noisy Jl Seminyak, the hotel is almost secluded and very quiet. Once you pass the main reception desk and nest yourself at poolside it is a true Haven!

The service provided is amazing. The dedicated teams (top to bottom - from management to kitchen) really strive to perfection, are very hospitable and have an eye for detail and service. The front desk team was very helpful and above all considerate of any needs that needed to be taken care of. I eventually cancelled a one week trip to Sanur because I liked to hotel so much. Facilities are very nice - pools are cleaned every day, the rooms were in good shape (paint, floors, furniture) and f&b is everything you wished for. Security at both front and back of the hotel keep unwanted visitors outside, and even do an hourly site check at night. The spa is amazing - never seen such a large bathroom before!

For someone being away from home for a long time I am glad to have chosen The Haven hotel.

Bagus, Anni and everybody else - thanks for making my stay at your hotel a pleasant, safe and comfortable one. My next trip is planned for November, so for sure - I'm coming back!!

Best regards, Lars",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2207,"Amazing helpful staff, just lovely!",40,August 2011,"We had such a great time at the heaven, and real value for money, the staff could not do enough for you! clean lovely rooms, really missing the pillows now and amazing breaky and jst lovely people will def be comming back!! only down side is pool can be a bit chilly cos is shaded alot of time, but were not sun worshipers so this was perfect for us to chill with a book nd a cocktail! bliss!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2208,Good value for money,30,February 2011,"Stayed here at the hotel side facing the main road, with my spouse for 4-nights. We had the room directly over the main swimming pool opposite the reception. It was clean, however the bathroom was not well maintained as there were moss on the floor and the room smelt musky. Would recommend the suites instead as these are better furnished and the restaurant is less crowded for breakfast. Location is not too bad as visitors to Bali typically engage the services of local drivers to fetch them around.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2209,Would have no hesitations booking this place again,50,July 2011,"We were a little hesitant to book this place after reading some reviews on this site. We went ahead and booked because we didn't want the hustle and bustle of Kuta, and didn't want a villa with pool because we travelled with a 3 year old. The Haven Suites & Villas are just that - a haven. If you are after a hotel with night clubs and a party atmosphere - then don't stay here!!!

We stayed when it was at full capacity in a one bedroom suite and it was so quite and peaceful. 4 pools to offer visitors (including kids pool). Many people have written on review sites and complained that the pools/decks/sunbeds don't receive full sun all day. But this was one of the features that we loved - so I guess it's a personal opinion. The fact that we were able to cool off in the pool and be shaded from the sun at times was a bonus. There was always parts of the pool that had sun. The pools were never full and we never had to fight for a spot. The most people we ever had in a pool at any one time was 10 people.

The 2 restaurants LemonCello (Villa & Suite side) and Sabeen (Hotel side) offered a variety of foods. We ate at LemonCello every morning for the buffet breakfast. Although small, we never had to wait for a table or for food/service. There was a good variety of buffet foods to choose from, including a chef cooking egg meals and another cooking pancakes, crepes and waffles on demand. Can't comment on LemonCello's dinner or lunch as we didn't eat there for those meals.

We ate at Sabeen a few times and had quite a few drinks there including coffees.Meals were fresh and of decent size. One meal (shared snack basket) was cold when it arrived. It really was just reheated and reserved. This particular snack was taken starit from freezer packs - not hand made on site. This was the only disappointing meal we experienced. Plenty of eateries around this hotel, so you are not obliged to eat here.

Rooms were very clean, and the bed would have to be the most comfortable bed we have ever experienced whilst holidaying. Rollaway was full size and a proper innerspring mattress. Great night sleeps in airconditioned rooms (2 airconditioners in 1 bedroom suite). We even had to turn down the settings as it was icy at one stage. Kitchenette, lounge, full sized fridge, dining table/chairs and couches made this suite like home. Room service was efficient when dining in, or for anything we asked. Rooms cleaned once a day, complimentary bottled water every day, and a turn down service early evening. Towels were fresh, white and unstained.

Our room was on the ground floor (Room 914), easy to enter and exit and well positioned. We couldn't hear noise from any other rooms. We did note that another hotel was being constructed on the other side of the complex so could be a bit noisy if you were staying on the other side. Construction is happening everywhere in Seminyak so I think it's pot luck. But worth asking if booking and trying to get a room on the opposite side.

We used the hotel entrance to enter and exit. Met some lovely staff and lots of friendly holiday makers too. Eka by the hotel pool was very helpful, as were all the staff in asking for advice and suggestions. We paid the extra $18 each way for airport transfers. Both times drivers were on time, cars were clean and cool. Worth the money, especially from the airport upon arrival.

The negatives would be the 21% service and tax charge on all food and services (this occurs in most places not just the Haven. Some places only charged 15%). Again most people expect hotel prices to be more expensive. The bath is a little difficult to enter and exit - it has the shower in the bath. It is quite high and a little awkward to enter/exit. But i'm just being picky and sharing my opinion.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2210,"Not really a Haven, but a stylish hotel trying hard",40,August 2011,"I found our arrival at the Haven stressful with no help with our luggage or direction to the reception tucked behind the loud restaurant/bar. Service I would expect at this sort of hotel.
We were not originally given the right bedding configuration due to the hotel being at capacity, but after me persisting with a follow up call, reception called back and were able to offer the option of moving rooms later that evening if we wanted to. They made this incredibly easy and while we were out to dinner, moved all our bags to our new room and we just had to pick the key up on our return to the property.
The restaurant at the front was loud with live music until about 11pm that seemed to echoed round the whole hotel.
The pool however was kept pretty quiet, and although the main pool is pretty small with only about 20 sun loungers around it, and even though the hotel was full, we had no difficulty finding space in the sun or shade as we prefered. I loved the sign advising if you left your things on a lounger for more than 30mins without returning to them they'd be removed so the lounger could be used by someone else! The pool was cold, and sun was limited round the pool due to the tight positioning of the buildings. Having the hotel built over the pool made me fill a little like I was swimming at the bottom of a multi-storey carpark, but the building was beautiful with creeping vines and flowers covering it.
The hotel had a great rate that we booked via Agoda, and given the price we paid compared to other properties I looked at in a similar area, I believe we got great value for money, if not quite the resort of my dreams!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2211,Great central location with modern rooms,40,August 2011,"Not close to the beach, but central to all the shopping! The service (whilst it was very busy while we were there was excellent) - thankyou Ngurah and team at the front desk. Breakfast - great. Rooms are clean and fairly basic, but very nice with flat screen TV and balcony. Soft soft sheets! Perfect spot for girls going on a shopping holiday with the pools offering a quiet break between spas and a quick walk to the best strip shopping in Bali!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2212,Fantastic,50,August 2011,"Myself and a friend stayed at the Haven for 10 days recently. This hotel was great - brilliant facilities, no hassles & super-friendly obliging staff. This is first time I've bothered writing a review, but the Haven was so good it deserved it.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2213,Concrete block lacking the Bali vibe,30,August 2011,"My wife and I and our two friends stayed in one-bedroom Haven suites for 10 days in July-August 2011. The Haven is a long, narrow property with two street frontages. The standard hotel-type rooms are at the front, on Jl Raya, the villas are in the middle, and the suites are in two five-storey blocks at the rear. Suite check-in and check-out occurs only at the desk at the rear of the property. If you go to the front desk on arrival you will suffer a delay while a staff member is found to take you and your bags 300 metres to the back of the hotel. If you have booked a suite, tell the taxi driver to cross Jl Raya and drive down Double Six to the laneway at the rear of the property. The lane is clearly marked with the green Haven sign. Most taxi drivers will at first refuse to do this, as they think it's too difficult. Unless you prefer to trudge through the entire hotel, you should insist.

The Haven has made a small effort to create the typical Bali garden, but due to lack of space, has failed utterly. We have been used to properties on an acreage, with gracious grounds and pools in full sun. Not so at the Haven. Note for management: Uber cool does not always equate to comfort.

The suites are very spacious, no complaints there, and the balcony is terrific. The suites have a large two-door fridge which we found very handy, and the kitchen/dining/lounge area is huge and well equipped. Sadly, the bathroom is dark and pokey. The shower is over the deep bath and its controls are difficult to access. The shower head is in a fixed high position and was not user-friendly for the ladies. Getting out of the bath required much care. The bedroom cannot be blacked out. The curtains do not meet, and the bathroom has a window to the corridor and a glass screen against the bath, so a fair bit of light encroaches.

Breakfast was adequate - not the mega choice we've found at the Santika Beach Resort or other properties, but sufficient to keep us happy. There was a minor yuk issue with flies on the food. The suite breakfast area is crowded under a pergola with the food laid out around the perimeter, with the result that it was a bit of a log jam. However, other tables are available for those liking a bit of privacy. The front breakfast area is in the restaurant facing the street. As the breeze blows into the restaurant from the street and smoking area, expect to do a bit of passive smoking while chowing down. There is also much traffic noise.

Our big complaint (and we were not alone) was the pools. The small pool in front of the suites was in almost total shade. The sun lounges were primo quality, but shaded. The pool was freezing! The main pool at the front of the Haven was overlooked by the hotel-style standard rooms, and the area around the pool was a walkway for guests. A block of rooms has been constructed over the pool, casting it into shade. There was no feeling of privacy; also no umbrellas. The paved surrounds generated a lot of heat, but strangely that pool also was very cold. We ended up using the pool at the Santika Beach Resort in Tuban, which was a bit ridiculous.

The two five-storey suite buildings are set at a slight angle to each other. At one end they are 20 metres apart, and they converge to about 15 metres at the other end. This has created a very effective wind tunnel, so that when a slight breeze blows around the main pool, a strong wind is generated at the suite pool.

Restaurant and room service meals are expensive and forgettable, but as the Haven is situated in the middle of a café and restaurant belt, this was not an issue. We all enjoyed Mades Warung and the Mannekepis jazz bar, both about 600 metres down the street. Great food at reasonable prices plus music at night. There are also a lot of good restaurants along the beach.

As always in Bali, the hotel staff was uniformly excellent. I was surprised to read comments about security, as we did not get that vibe at all.

We were disappointed with the speed of the WiFi network and with the Internet corner, where one of the three computers always seemed to be off-line and the other two were continually occupied.

Guests were from all over, which we liked. Also a lot of young adults and very few Oz bogs. You will not suffer rowdy groups at this property; they are very hot on noise.
Forget about the so called beach club, but do use the courtesy vehicle to get to the beach when going out for a meal. Change your money across the road and 50 metres to the left – good rate and honest.

Checking out was painfully slow, but that’s Bali. Allow plenty of time.

Major warning: It is possible to have your holiday at the Haven totally ruined by being allocated the wrong room. On one side of the suites (this does not affect the villas or standard rooms) a new hotel is scheduled for construction. As at August 2011, the land was being worked all day by excavators. The noise levels can only increase. Suite rooms to avoid due to construction noise are 901-909 (ground floor), 101-109, 201-209, 301-309 and 401-409. If you can’t get a guaranteed room, consider another property.
Unless you like being woken at 6.00 am by staff setting up breakfast, avoid rooms 910-913 (ground floor), 110-113, 210-213, 310-313 and 410-413. The breakfast area is also a walkway, so the noise is constant. Rooms 910-913 were the worst located suites I have seen in 20 visits to Bali. They had absolutely no privacy, and copped a relentless level of noise. Rooms 919, 119, 219 etc are next to the lift shaft and staff service rooms, so some moderate noise could be expected there. We were in room 215, which we found very good. Our friends in 415 said it was fine, but they preferred our view, looking though the trees to the pool. Note that the ground floor suite rooms have a balcony looking in towards the pool (and breakfast area!) but guests cannot walk from their balcony to the pool area. They must go out through their suite entrance door and down the corridor.

In summary, our time at the Haven was saved by its location and ease of access to the things one does on holiday. Comfortable, but don’t expect a Bali experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2214,"Fabulous room, pools, breakfasts best I've had in Bali",40,June 2011,In the heart of Seminyak where you will find the best shopping & nightlife this hotel is a great find - I will definately stay there again!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2215,"Sweet, sweet place!",40,July 2011,We stayed at Haven room - the room was actually nicer than it is in pictures and it is quite large! Staff was friendly and helpful.

2216,TOP SPOT,50,June 2011,"My husband & I stayed here for 4 nights, and loved the hotel so much
we will definately stay again next visit to Bali, it was very central to
shopping etc, and only a 10 min walk to the excellent beach, down near
the Bungy Jump, we ate at lovely beachfront restuarants, as well as the
excellent dining/breakfast area at the ' Haven"" the staff very friendly
obliging, and polite. We couldnt fault a thing about this Hotel, pool lovely
and the rooms very clean and comfortable. Whether one decides on the
rooms, as we did, or the Villas, or Appartment commodation at this hotel
I am sure they will not be disappointed.
Consider this hotel is planning to stay in the Seminyak area.

2217,Not the resort we were looking for....,30,September 2010,"My partner & I were disappointed as The Haven was quite claustrophobic - not like the resorts with wide expansive areas to move about, for example Breezes just a short distance away great value for money & plenty of room - the food was great too as we were there the previous year! The Haven breakfasts were simply not up to speed>restaurant was too close to the front of the road - Staff not up to speed either! I gave it 2.5 stars...disappointed",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2218,I love this hotel and although is very modern is very very comfortable,50,July 2011,"This hotel is one of the best maintained and cleanest hotels in Bali. I frequent Bali often and stay at many hotels and although this one is modern it's cleanliness standards are very very high. You often see new hotels getting very 'mouldy' very quickly but this hotel has no signs of this.

they keep high levels of staff and because the hotel is split with the private villa's in the middle the hotel doesn't seem as big as some larger hotels can. The choice of two separate pool area's and 4 pools allows for an easy stay.

Some other hotel guests 'stole' my pool lilo from outside my room about 5 days before i left. I couldn't find it and reported it to the staff. The staff have since contacted me every day to say they continuing to look for it and have now located it and holding it until my next trip to Bali in 10 weeks. NEVER have I received such amazing service !!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2219,nice but no true bali feel,30,July 2011,"Good location for shopping and restaurants. pool lovely to look at but constantly in the shade and as July is milder weather by bali standards, not hot enough to swim in. Be great for sun sensitive and in warmer months. Suites spacious and well appointed but the resort somehow lacked the bali resort feel. More apartment like with communal pool.
Mostly Aussies so also lacked the cosmopolitan flavour often experienced in Seminyak.
Food venues at hotel pretty average as was pool menu and room service.
Would return if great specials came up otherwise would try somewhere else next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2220,Well located for great shopping!,50,July 2011,"We stayed at the Haven Hotel for one night before we flew home to Oz. We had ground floor adjoining rooms that opened to the pool. We found service, quality of rooms, cleanliness and comfort to be very good. It was well priced too. We would stay there again as it was very well located in Seminyak for great shopping and restaurants.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2221,It was nice,40,July 2011,"I have stayed at many hotels in Bali so I thought downgrading to the Haven would make my stay in Bali average.

The Haven is no Conrad or Bulgari but, it is extremely clean and if you are nice to the workers they are nice back. A simple process. We had nothing stolen and we both often left money, iPods, laptops and phones around whilst the room was unattended.

The only fault I have about this hotel was that the breakfast station was set up poorly. E.g there wasn't much of a selection and anything eggs wise had to be made fresh therefore you had to wait a loonnnnnnnnng time if you got there at 9am(peak hour). Also the breakfast didn't go for long. For people like us, who liked to go for a run/workout we had to make sure we were up extra early to get breaky. Next time I'd probably skip the breakfast and find cool places on the street.

The pool was nice, sometimes a little shady but I got tanned so I'm not complaining.

I would go back with my partner and friends but, it is definitely not a hotel for families. Thank god!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2222,Nice place,40,June 2011,"First time in Bali and we had read shocking reviews and good reviews on several hotels. We picked this one and decided on a Suite. The suite was roomy and very clean. Robes, slippers shampoo/conditioner/ shower gel, soaps, moisturising lotion, shaver+cream, toothbrushes/toothpaste, tissues, hair dryer and bottled water all there and free of charge. There was a flat screen TV in the lounge/kitchen area and also one in the bedroom (we had a QB Suite)

There was a cook top, cutlery, plates, glasses but you do have to ask for tea towel and cooking utensils including pots and pans if you required same. This would have been no problem. Housekeeping came daily. The supermarket down the road stocked everything you would need and sooooo cheap. The balcony ran the full length of both the lounge and bedroom areas and there was one large and one small day bed. These balconies overlook all other balcony/suites opposite you so not a lot of privicy. We were on the 3rd floor and we found this suite/area to be very quiet. No noise from any other suites around us, which was a big plus and all balconies overlook the pools (3) 1large and two smaller near the breakfast area. There is another pool on the hotel side of the complex also. The water in both pools was 'freezing'. The main pool (suites area) only got sun in a small corner and whether that was the time of year or not I dont know. We used the hotel pool a couple of times but a much smaller area and a not a lot of sun lounges in comparison with the number of guests.

The front of the hotel opens onto the main street and this is where you sit and watch the traffic go by, have a drink, snack or lunch/dinner. We were amazed at the amount of traffic/noise in this street. I would say there would be maybe 30-50 scooters for every car in Bali and no road rules, with the scooters going on the footpath if there was a 'traffic jam', which there always is! I would suggest not getting a hotel room on this side at all.

There is a supermarket just up the road from the front of the hotel (Bintang) and also a money exchange that was 'safe ' just before the Bintang on the other side of the road. The 'beach' was an easy 10min walk. The first time you are in shock when you see the 'black sand'. There is rubbish everywherre and this was washing up from the ocean via all the drains. Its funny though, you seem to just get used to it. We did not swim though - as advised. - apart from the fact water was cold.

The hotel staff were all excellent, greeting you where ever you walked with a smile and a hello. The breakfast (which was included in the price) was great. The staff were lovely. I dont know why some people that have commented on the hotel thought otherwise. The hot food catered for all tastes and you could have your eggs done in whatever way you wanted. Two types of bacon and different other hot dishes like fried rice, sausages, potatos (done differently daily) tomatos etc etc. There was everything from fresh fruit, to sweet pastries, to different breads, sushi, porridge, cereal awesome pancakes (try the chocolate sauce - to die for), waffles and 4 different fruit juces as well. You could have coffee/tea(included) but if you want something like a latte it would cost you a bit extra which you signed for and it went on your bill in the end.

We had one little problem in the buffet dinner the first night we went with the food being cold. I spoke to the the assistant manager about it the next day, he was extremely nice, helpful and approachable and it was sorted on the spot.

We hired a driver for our trips out and about and found this to be so much more cost effective than booking a tour.

I would certainly recommend the Haven Suites but would suggest checking several companies and even the hotel itself before booking as we found it would be much cheaper to book direct and they also have some periodic specials - but remember to ask for an all up price including tax and get it in writing.....We checked out the pool suites while we were there....awesome. The one we saw was two bedrooms and your own pool, spacious and again clean and modern. For two couples or families - great - but the second bedroom was a lot smaller than the main - you'll have to toss a coin or swap half way through your holiday! :)

Thanks to everyone on Trip Advisor for all their info and thoughts which I read many of before we left. It all came in very handy......",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2223,A HAVEN OF ROBBERY AND CORRUPTION,10,May 2011,"It was only the first night we had stayed here when we woke up with our bedroom door open! First thing I did was look around to see what was missing and as you can imagine-passports, wallets and all of our money was gone! We spoke to the staff and they were completely UNHELPFUL! It was like they were all in on it. They continued to threaten us saying that they will call the police... the last thing you want. We just left the Haven of Robbery and walked to another resort asking for what we she do. We ended up going to the Embasy and they told us what police station to go to and to to see. I spoke to one of the workers at Haven and he said that this happens a lot. Long story short, NEVER STAY IN THIS HAVEN OF CORRUPTION!!!!!!! Scary experience",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2224,Do not stay here if you intend to stay longer than a day!!!!,10,June 2011,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel from 18th to 25th June and were disappointed for a number of reasons stated below.
1, On arrival little recognition given as guests staying longer than overnight.
2. Service of food & drinks ordered in restaurant took too long to arrive for a 4 star hotel.
3. Little privacy to bathroom and toilet in room as well as faulty sliding door and shower head which must have been noticed by housekeeping but was only fixed when complaint made.
4. No available power points in room for computer or any other devices.
5. Pool in shade all day and pool bar service non existent - staff never asked if you wanted anything - just stood around talking to each other whilst ignoring guests.
6. Would definitely not stay there longer than overnight even though in a very handy location. A 4 star hotel providing 2.5 - 3 star service and facilities
7. Was offered a free spa and massage after speaking with front desk manager but we did not avail ourselves of this.
8. Finally air conditioning blows directly on you when seated at desk in the room & can not be adjusted properly so had to turn off & then sweltered in humidity and heat.

6. Would definitely not stay there longer than overnight even though in a very handy location. A 4 star hotel providing 2.5 - 3 star service and facilities
7. Was offered a free spa and massage after speaking with front desk manager but we did not avail ourselves of this.
8. Finally air conditioning blows directly on you when seated at desk in the room & can not be adjusted properly so had to turn off & then sweltered in humidity and heat.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2226,"Don't be scammed, won't stay again and was third stay.",20,July 2011,"Booked through wotif and no provision to book with children. Booked other accom at the previous sofitel & novetel nusa dua and no prob. When checking in they stated we hadn't booked for child so extra $55.00 for rollaway bed. Booked same room perviously, same rate, and rollaway included. Offered upgrade to suite for $50.00 (special price) but still no extra bed and that was chargeable. Last time we stayed at this hotel the same happened to the people who were staying in a room next door. Requested to reception to speak to supervisor & it did not appear he was conveying our concern/messages. Spoke to his supervisor & she wasn't very nice. Then spoke to the so called manager and he didn't care one bit. I explained the problem with wotif and he said that it was our fault. He laughed off the suggestion that I would place something on trip advisor. We then took our original room & and our daughter can just share the bed. Good luck sleeping though. We were then told the manager was actually the manager of housekeeping and the only manager available. If you pay the extra money you are better off staying at the previous sofitel (royal beach seminyak) where we had stayed a couple of days ago. It is 5 stars and they can' t do enough to help. Free upgrades & great facilities. Be careful staying at the haven as you may be charged extra for children, beds, breakfast extra. It should be noted we have stayed here twice previously and while the position is good & but not on the beach, by the time you get scammed for extras on the day you may be better staying elsewhere. Other places have bigger pools, kids clubs etc etc.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2227,"Robbed and overcharged, thanks Haven!!!",10,June 2011,"We just returned from a weeks stay at the Haven, at first it was perfect but the last couple of days our stay was compleatley ruined.
The good things (I am trying to be fair here even though its difficult after the way we have been treated); location fantastic, pools and garden beautiful and tranquil, room had everything we needed and cleaned to high standard every day, ATMA spa awsome!! I visited 3 times during our stay and had a great experience everytime.

Now for the bad points; we had our Iphone 4 stolen from our room on the 5th day. Our room was locked, we had no visitors, we left it in a side compartment of a bag on the floor by our suitcases. Hotel do not care, took us to police station in Kuta to report 'missing' phone. No concern or apology from hotel. Cheers Haven!

Next to really make sure the holiday was completley ruined.............on check out room bill over $400.00 went to pay with my bank card ""it won't work"" o.k can you try it again ""have tried twice, not honored"". Hummmm, o.k we will pay with another card.....eureka! That one worked. Get home last night, my bank cards overdrawn........why? Because the idiot charged us twice.

Waiting to hear back from hotel on both situations, I want my refund asap and I want to know if they care that staff members have sticky fingers as they took no responsibility or blame when informed of the missing phone. Must have been someone with access to our room, I'm no Sherlock Holmes but that surely says something!

We will never go again, never recommend (well, maybe to someone we don't like).

Shame, it's a good hotel otherwise.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2228,a great holiday with family & friends,50,June 2011,"What an experience. We had 10 people in all and booked two 2 bedroom suites and 1 hotel room to cater for everyone's needs.After arriving late in the evening we ate at one of the restauraunts which was very nice.The breakfast was exceptional (not as large as a 5 star resort) but nor was the price tag to go with that option.The location is central to most activities and the food options are very good throughout the area and within walking distance for most people.
If you require transport for a tour or trip to anywhere it is only a walk to the front of The Haven to access the drivers who are usually out there waiting. Our special thanks to Wombie and Juni, they were exceptional in there knowledge and would cater for whatever we required in tours etc. Taxis abound everywhere.
The staff are very good, the rooms were cleaned daily,the suites had plenty of room for 4 adults,large fridge,table and chairs and the day bed outside on the balcony was very nice with the breaze that came through.Some areas are slippery when wet especially the showers area.
Except for the occasional mosquito (which The Haven controlled to the best of there ability) we would have no problem at all returning to this facility again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2229,Fantastic hotel nestled away in a busy vibrant seminyak,50,June 2011,"we are currently staying at the haven as we speak. First impressions were quite good, we managed to score an upgrade to a suite was a nice surprise. I can not commend the hotel staff enough on there exceptional level of service and willingness to help you. At our end of the premises it is quite and we have all the mod cons from home in this fantastic venue. The buffet Breakfast is fantastic with a large selection of food to cater for everyonebody's tastes. The Staff are attentive and are quick to lean away any finished meals. I have done alot of travelling and would be happy to recommend this venue to others. it offers value for money, good facilities and exceptional service whilst nestled away in the middle of a busy seminyak. almost forgot about the several options for pools catering for familes, couples and singles alike.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2230,The most suites with Mosquito in Bali,10,June 2011,"We were in Bali last week from June 23 until 28 stayed at suite 914 at the Haven Seminyak Hotel & Suites.
We were fighting with mosquitos for the entire weeks while we were staying at this suites. As we were worry of the Degue Fever, we called the Housekeeping at the first night explaining about the mosquitos attack in the room. The housekeeping attendant came and gave us Baygon mosquitos spray and asked us to spray the room by ourself. The second night onward we were fighting with mosquitos attack and busy with spraying the room everytime before we went to sleep.
The last night before we left, we catched about 15 mosquitos, put it in the envelope and handed over to the guest relations to bring-up to the General Manager attention. Is a pitty that the General Manager could not careless, otherwise we could have giving him a suggestions how to solved this problem.
The service is so,so, the ashtray in the balcony never been cleaned for the last 5 days, the coffee mug in the room were not also cleaned on daily basis, the face towel was not replaced until we called the housekeeping department.
The breakfast is so paranoid like in the zoo, as we have to fight for table and for the foods in little tiny area that they served for breakfast. The skirting on the buffet breakfast probably never been changed since the hotel opened, it was so dirty. The breakfast area is so noisy, so you dont need a wake up call in the morning as the waiter speaks so loudly talking among them self. If you are staying in this hotel, you better make sure that you are staying far away from the breakfast area. And dont forget to tell them to spray the room with anti mosquitos every night when you were away. Otherwise as usual, we always enjoyed Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2231,Great Holiday!,50,June 2011,"I booked the Haven after reading the reviews, but wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly suprised. It was all that the (positive reviews) said it was. Great area. You can walk to many great restaurants. Short cheap taxi ride to Kuta Square and other area's. Close to Legian markets.As we are not night owls, it was great that there was a DVD in the room. DVD directly opposite the Hotel.Also free internet. I will be staying there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2232,New Hotel just beautiful,50,June 2011,"situated in the heart of seminyak, the shops are on your doors step and the restaurants are only a 10minute walk away. The rooms are spacious and have a very modern design, beautiful monsoon shower heads. The staff were always there to help, and the buffet was extensive, the gym was small but had all new equiptment which was a treat to use.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2233,Pleasant stay but not again,30,June 2011,"The pleasant surprise we received was upon arrival, the reception told us to check-in in the back reception because our reservation was upgraded to suite! We didn't mind the walk to the back as the hotel staff helped us with the bags. However, the check-in took quite a long time.
First impression of the hotel was great! Reception had us waiting at the common area because rooms were not ready. The welcoming drink (which we were told to have) never came despite reminders after reminders.
Finally got our suite. Pretty modern and clean. The air condition in the bed room was not working.
we had breakfast at the hotel next morning. the restaurant is understaffed as plates were not collected, tables not cleaned fast enough to cater for the crowd. slow refills for the buffet.
on the 2nd, we were shocked to find that housekeeping took our bath robes away without a new replacement!
we had dinner at the Sabeem restaurant. they have great live music, but again, the service was bad. had a long wait to get the bill...
checking-out was horrible. took us more than half hour to get checked out. on top of that, the hotel charged us for something we did not consume from the mini bar!
if not for the upgrade, we would be very disappointed. as the hotel is still new, it's a pleasant stay but we won't go back there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2234,we wont be back,20,June 2011,"cobwebs that stayed in the room for 9 days ! airconditioning that sounded like concrete mixers/ we had to put thongs under the refrigerator to stop the noise! scratched and marked benchtops. Cracked floors. ""pictures do not depicted the real look"" Uncooked meat several times and my Fiancee got Bali Belly from in house BBQ needed to be taken to a clinic in nusa dua. Seminyak itself is great but the hotel I would never recommend. The pool is freezing cold no swim up pool I have been to Bali 4 times and this is the worst. No one hardly in the 10days I was there swam !!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2235,Beg to differ with the consensus view on this hotel,20,June 2011,"The Haven attracts some very positive reviews and that tends to be a big pull for me in terms of making my choice of hotel.

I just can't really get my head around the basis for those rave reviews. To be specific::

> The problem with the pool and sun loungers is a negative aspect highlighted in other reviews so I won't repeat here except to say that for a resort style hotel the planning/design of this property on a long thin block entails that minimal sunlight reaches the pool areas. Similarly, other reviewers have commented on noise levels. This too can be a problem if you are at the front of the hotel.
> Not sure I am anything like as enthusiastic in terms of the breakfast as are some of the other reviewers. I do a lot of travelling in Asia and for a 4* property I thought the offering was fairly ordinary. I particularly took exception to the fruit juices. Sweet fruit ‘flavoured” sugar water and if you wanted a real juice you needed to purchase it, the bacon alternated daily between very fatty streaky bacon and cheap “formed” bacon rashers. Sorry but that's simply unacceptable. Service levels in the restaurant are poor (with the very notable exception of Desi who really shone) ...salt and pepper in little sachets...really hate those things. You get just one knife..... to use for everything, that’s not 4*. Little things which all add up. Whilst on the subject of catering perhaps also worth a mention was the presence of the Executive Chef in the dining room......sat smoking at one of the dining tables!!!!
>I agree with previous reviewers in terms of the friendliness of staff but there is a distinction to be drawn between friendliness and effectiveness. I have already mentioned service levels in the restaurant but housekeeping was also below that’s required for a 4* property. When we arrived in our room we noticed that one of the curtains had mould on the reverse of the lining. On two occasions we needed to phone housekeeping after 4pm in the afternoon to get our room made-up. The service standard (I discovered) for change of bed linen is every two days but this frequently extended to three days. If there are face flannels in your room when you arrive then hold onto them because they might not get replaced. Towards the end of our stay a supervisor from housekeeping came to investigate my frequent calls to housekeeping. Interestingly, service levels improved significantly after that. Rather like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.
> Finally, turning to the quality of the rooms and the furnishings. I can only comment in terms of the hotel (i.e not the suites or villas). The bed was great; with a comfy mattress. The rest of the room was fairly basic. A modest hotel room fit-out with only a two small drawers big enough for a week’s supply of underwear, limited hanging room and a few shelves on the floor. Very simple bar fridge which struggled to get drinks really cold and no ice compartment, meant going to the bar for ice which was handed over begrudgingly by the bar staff.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2236,"Cool little place, great value with some nice features",40,April 2011,"I stayed in this place with my girlfriend and 2 friends back in April, and were quite pleasantly surprised. The gf booked it off the cuff, not quit knowing what to expect and basing her choice on Tripadvisor reviews, and luckily they were all spot on! From start to finish we had a very comfortable stay, with a great daily bfast (we stayed for 5 nights and made the effort every morning, despite some late nights!).
Upon arriving, late on a Thursday night, we were impressed by the thoughtful design and above average attention to detail through the pick/up drop off point, through to the bar/restaurant, to the lobby and pool area, which looked good all lit up at night - was also nice and quiet, with just a few people hanging out at the bar with a bit of music.
Staff were always courteous and friendly, helpful whenever possible, tho sometimes a bit vacant (staff training will iron that out), also a gripe, the staff were a bit noisey and inconsiderate first thing in the mrng, not a major deal as we always got up for bfast, but made a long lie-in difficult (unless passed out from booze!) and also guests children running around (maybe go 'no kids' Mgmt? - will certainly help with credibility as a trendy, sleek resort?).
Rooms were fine, standard 3/4 star level of furniture, fittings, plasma tv, king size bed, bathroom sleek and modern and well stocked with amenities, decent shower.
Pool was a good size, 25m or so, enabling proper laps among the sun seeking Aussies, with plenty of sun loungers and free towels - only thing here is that our room was on ground floor with patio right on to the pool, which is great, tho again, a bit noisey in the morning with kids screaming to and fro, staff on hand throughout the day to bring drinks and tend to the general area.
Location of hotel is fine, right in the middle of trendy Seminyak and an easy cab to crazy silly Kuta and Legian.
Our stay was topped off with the hotel's complimentary shuttle service to the airport - a surprising touch.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2237,Awesome stay,50,May 2011,"Stayed 4d3n at the hotel in one of the 4th level room. Clean room. Love the simplicity design. Mosquitoes n bugs might fly in from the balcony, so always keep the balcony doors closed. The hotel has fumigation on every thurs evening, so i supposed it really does help to minimise the flying bugs. Lots of tv channels, if im not wrong, there were 60 diff channels. Staff were polite n quick to help. Breakfast has a wide range of varieties and very appetizing. The place is very safe as they have security guards infront of the hotel. Kuta beach is probably about 15mins taxi ride away, depending on thr traffic condition. However i found out that we can walk to the seminyak beach appx 10mins by at back of the hotel. Which is alot closer. This hotel is a prominent landmark at seminyak n if you dont mind paying slightly more, i highly recommmended to stay at this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2238,Still a great place to stay.,40,June 2011,"Last year we stayed at The Haven and really enjoyed it. Reading the reviews listed over the past year I can see that the staff have acted on some of the feedback. There is certainly an improvement in the breakfast, the options are great and the waffle/pancake station was my favourite, a really good range of pastries also and the Baked Beans were the best I have ever had, wish they had been available everyday.
This year we booked a one bed suite, found ourselves on the first floor, would have liked to be higher but still OK. We travelled with another family and the staff had us in rooms right next door to each other which we appreciated. The suites are large with a massive living area, kiitchen, though no utensils, and a full size fridge. The plasma screens are great, one large in the lounge and a smaller one in the bedroom. They weren't turned on very often however towards the end of the fortnight we did enjoy a couple of movie nights. The suite has a stereo system with an iPod docking station which also plays CD's and DVD's.
The bed was very comfortable, I had no trouble sleeping though my husband did not like the pillows. I loved the daybed on the balcony, spread a pool towel out and took a pillow outside and spent some time lying down reading, loved it. The bathroom however was the only problem with this room. The shower area showed some signs of water seepage which is not unusal in Bali. The shower was located in the bathtub, not usually such a problem however this was a large bathtub. I don't know how someone who was even slightly mobility challenged would get in and out. I doubt my retired in laws or parents would be able to manage. I slipped getting out on the last day and 3 days later have a bruise the size of my fist on my leg. I think the design would have been better with a slightly smaller living area and increased space in the bathroom for a shower cubicle. Would love to know if there are one bed suites with a shower cubicle that I could request next time.
Outside of the room the staff are very friendly and are happy to help with any questions you have. Could not fault the staff at all.
Once again I really enjoyed my stay and we are certainly happy to go back to The Haven a third time next byear.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2239,Pleasant place to stay in the city,40,June 2011,"The haven is a very well priced, clean hotel that delivers what it promises. We got a special on agoda and it was under $100 a night. The hotel has a great breakfast - something for everyone. The street that the hotel is located on is not bad. Plenty of shops around however most are fixed price unless you're prepared to jump into negotiations with them in Indonesian. (worked for us on several occasions) the area is good as it out of the main dirty kuta area. If I can give you some advice - stay away from there. It's a major disappointment.
The hotel has nice rooms. Everything you need to feel at home without paying for a 5 star resort.
FYI - when you're in semi yak and trying to get a taxi around town, try and get the ones with a meter, it will always work out cheaper. The trip to kuta should be around 35000 however if you ask a cab driver ""how much to kuta"" or something similar the first price they're going to offer is 100000. Most will drop to 40000 once you challenge them on price.
We hired scooters from the hotel behind the haven ""coco suites"" I think it was. (40000 per day = $4au approx) some other people we were talking to hired bikes and payed 50000 per day ($50au) so it pays to shop around. FYI if you're a westerner out on a scooter be prepared to get pulled over by the police, they make up fines for tourists, it's really annoying. they will ask for some cash to make the matter ""go away"" - you can argue and say that you've already paid another policeman at a different intersection and they will let you go. If you just want to get the heck out of there pay them 100000 and they'll let you go.
The facilities at the hotel are reasonable - 2 large pools. One is a quiet pool and the other has a bar and some music playing in the background. Nothing special but adequate.
All in all I'd recommend the hotel if you were staying in the area.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2240,"Nice hotel, great pool",40,February 2011,"I decided to give myself a bit of luxury on my stay in Bali and stay at the Haven.

The room is probably standard size, with a nice balcony that overlooked the amazing pool. I had many an afternoon out there with a bintang and book.

Breakfast was pretty basic, but tasty, and the hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of the Bintang supermarkeet.

Checkin was a little slow, but all good.

I loved the very long pool out front, with a similar one at the back that was used more by the people staying in the suites. The water was actually cool which was nice on the very hot days.

If I can get another discount rate I'll be happy to stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2241,Nice hotel but a few issues..,40,June 2011,"Firstly...The staff are incredibly helpful and LOVELY! They even let us leave our bags in the lobby under security locker until we left at 8pm! They also gave us a room later in the evening free of charge for a shower. Nothing is too difficult for the staff and they are there to help you.
We stayed for 6 days for a wedding and upgraded on check in from the ""hotel"" room to the suite. Paid $120/n all up but we got the deal on expedia for $70 for the hotel room and upgrade was $50USD/night to move to the suite. Gorgeous room for first impressions though there were a few issues...
Firstly the place is designed badly... it is a corridor with rooms on either side and our room happened to be right on the buffet breakfast restaurant, i.e. we were awake from 6am every morning but it was nothing ear plugs couldnt fix (unless there was a screaming kid right outside your room!!). It is loud. If you are there for R&R then maybe book a villa? The hotel rooms are right on the pool that has music blaring all day and the bar right next to the rooms is open til 2am!
The room had a beautiful bathroom with a vase of water with bamboo in it - the water has attracted ALOT of mozzies!! I think perhaps they should remove the water and put stones or something else in there. The room had very dark lighting so it felt at times we were in a cave!! We were there for a wedding so one can only guess what my make up looked like... There are two pools, only one gets sun but people seem to come and go all day so we always managed a lounge so no issues there! Food at the restaurant is ok for a quick bite, there are better places around though but I think the breakfast was pretty great. Waffles, pancakes, bacon etc etc!
I would recommend this place, but pack earplugs! The staff are fantastic and the location for shopping is great too :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2242,Good for Value & Great!,40,June 2011,"And, am really glad that we chose this hotel to stay during our trip to Bali recently, with my family and two young kids. The breakfast spread was good, and the pancake was great.
The pool was nice too, and they are thoughtful to offer balls for the kids to play.
You can also go to the beach (they will send you there via their buggy) and they prepared the beach seats for you to relax too.
The massage at the spa was good too, just that, its a bit higher than those offered outside. But I guess, you pay for the environment too.
They even prepared breakfast box for us on our departure day, because we needed to leave before the cafe open. All you need to do, is just ask. Overall, service was good and attentive. I will come back here again if am coming to Bali again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2243,In the heart of Seminyak,30,May 2011,"Nice hotel in a great location at the heart of Seminyak. 10min walk to the beach. There are two pools, one at the hotel the other one is at the suites area. All rooms are facing the pool. We stayed at the standard room, king size bed quite comfortable. The bathroom on the other hand for me needs more cover up. You can actually see through everything. No privacy at all.
When staying there should try going to Warung Made, its a local restaurant not very far from the hotel when we went on thursday night to have dinner, there was a Balinese traditional dance performance. So it was quite nice to have dinner while watching that.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2244,Great Hotel.... BUT !,30,May 2011,"3 day before check in, the staff in the phone ok sir, will prepare it for you.

1 day before check in, i call again to remain my request, and the staff who answered my phone said, i never request it, and pool view room is full until 2 days later. but there still a room for me and my wife.

when i came to the hotel, i got a room on 3rd floor with roof view, even there is a small garden but i don't like it, i was complained about that room, but i can't get any pool views room, and they promise i will get it on the next day.

on the next day, i give my key and asking for staff promise, the staff said my new room will be ready at 2pm. go back to the hotel at 2pm, and our room is not ready, and i have to waiting for a hour at the lobby.

that why i said this is great hotel but.... the staff is not professional.. about the room, for me the room furniture is not cozy, cheap look woods for a table and bed, only semi transparent glass between bedroom and bathroom, not feel comfort if we have to sit on toilet.

for moslem, be careful with the breakfast, sometimes pork and other food is mixed in one place",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2245,Great location but not the restful oasis I was hoping for,30,May 2011,"Nice new (ish) hotel but the layout is not good as the hotel rooms all face the pool and the restaurant is open air so the noise and nighty music do not make for a restful stay sadly, which is what I had hoped. I guess my own fault for not investigating that side of things more but it would have been great if the owner had invested in double glass.

So i would not recommend this hotel if you want to chill out in the evening and escape the hectic Kuta scene in the evening.

I did end up complaining to reception when i came back one day and found a member of housekeeping using my bathroom when dropping off new towels (not what i would expect when arriving back to my room to find someone in my toilet!). Not something i would say was good customer service. Unfortunately the staff on reception at the time didnt seem to understand what i was upset about so I gave up in the end and have put my thoughts in here.

The location is good and perfect for shopping and close to the Bintang supermarket but sadly that incident put me off.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2246,Bad Bad Bad My bag was stolen from my room whist I was sleeping !!,10,May 2011,"I stayed one night in this decieving beautiful hotel. Would have rated it highly but I came into my room at 1am with my handbag and woke up at 7am and the door was open and my bag missing.. All my cash, cards, mobiles phones, camera and PASSPORT!
The staff left our door open unlocked when they walked us in and obviously waited to see if we checked it.. we did not and someone slipped in shortly after.
One of the english speaking staff told us it happens frequently.. Never ever leave your possesions out at night use the safe and be very careful.. It was awful and ruined what was otherwise a great holiday. Wish I went no where near this hotel!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2247,Will definetely come back!,40,October 2010,"I was went for my honeymoon back on October 2009. They still renovating the new site (the one which gate faced seminyak road - near circle K), so at that time I enjoy quite lower price for 3 nights stay for Deluxe room.
The room was spacious, and the amenities were excellent. All the goods were new at that time. Breakfast taste great (must try the omelette, best so far), although the menu is repetitively same and not much variation.
Decoration modern nature, fresh and cool for the eyes.
Walking distance only to Kuta",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2248,Haven is right!,50,May 2011,"I miss you guys. To Clive, Kristian, and the crew at the Haven, thanks heaps for a wonderful stay.

What can I say but fantastic service and great food, with a room made up every day. We were up on the 4th floor overlooking the lovely staircase of water and the pool, with a northerly view of the Seminyak neighbourhood. Quiet, easy sleeping with a great bed, good facilities, a real positive after a draining flight. We saw the volcano from the room on the first day.

I have to say a big HI to Desi, who went out of her way to provide excellent table service for us. I miss our breakfast 'dates', haha!

Would return in a heartbeat to The Haven. It is a sanctuary amidst the busy Bali scene, and a great place to come 'home' to after a full on day out. It is central to everything.

See you again soon, Grant",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2249,"Good Facilities, Closer to Legian than Seminyak",40,May 2011,"Haven Hotel looks different from the outside than what it is on the inside. My first impression was that it was going to be a party hotel based on the number of people lounging at the restaurant. Once you get past the restaurant, the hotel is actually quiet. Facilities are kept clean and the area is huge - it stretches very far back, which is where the private villas and suites are and a few more pools, which are open to all guests. It's nice to have a choice of pool area. It's about a 10 minute walk to the beach.

The room I stayed in had modern furniture and a little balcony. Our balcony looked over a small green area on the roof. The refrigerator in the room was not working the whole time we were there, even after calling the front desk for repair. The air conditioning was not strong and we called maintenance late in the evening for a repair - it was good that they came however the problem was not fixed and we decided it was too late to to stay up while the engineers tried to solve the issue. I also had trouble with the safe and called three times for someone to come up. That issue was not resolved until I was back later in the evening. Once after the maids had cleaned the room, they left an outside chair inside by the bed. Makes you wonder what they were doing.

We rented a car for 1/2 day sightseeing and it was driven by one of the members of the staff / travel team. They were knowledgeable and accommodating and it was one of the highlights of the trip.

When I checked out early the next morning, I waited nearly 10 minutes while the front desk was attempting to radio someone to check my room. I had to leave right away and could not wait and hurriedly asked them to charge anything on my credit card. I think the hotel has good intentions but it seems that the staff is not trained thoroughly and is very slow.

Even with all of the problems, I would stay there again based on the good deal we got online. The area is prime for shopping and restaurants and the facilities are clean and nicer than other hotels that I've stayed at in Bali. Haven is pretty good, has a great breakfast and was worth the value for the deal we got on Expedia.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2250,Wonderfull. Bali Bagus!,50,May 2011,"The Haven Hotel in Seminyak, Bali, is simply wonderfull, the rooms are modern, clean, safe, quiet, spacious, have a security safe, balcony, airconditioning, and the meals are great, the staff are the friendliest you will ever meet, nothing is too much trouble, you will want for nothing!, I will be back for sure.
It is situated minutes north of Kuta, minutes walking away form the boozy crowds, The Haven is more refined, suitable for families, and those beyond the drinking mobs of the beach front resorts where people are everywhere, all the time. No tacky beach traders,or the filth of Kuta, countless shops, transport, and anything you may need. The Bali experience was just wonderfull. Very inexpensive and affordable.
A company named ""Destnation Asia"" were fantastic, from airpot transfers, to sightseeing and beyond, Incredibly cheap too, you can go on the usual routes or makeup your own, for 1 driver, the guide, the vehicle, 4 people for 10 hours was a mere $80 Aus. The Balanees people are friendly, and most speak English well.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2251,Great Stay! Will Return for Next Trip!,50,May 2011,"We stayed in a one bedrom suite at the Haven and had a lovely time there. The service staff were impeccable in their manners and always took the initiative to pre-empt our needs. As we travel at least four times to Bali for R&R a year, it was great to have found The Haven.

Service aside, we appreciate the effort put into the planning and maintenance of the landscaped areas (esp. the POOL!), as well as the cleanliness of the rooms and common areas. As the suites are situated at the back of the lot, we were able to get away from the hustle and bustle of the traffic at the front (where the hotel rooms are), but not compromise on the location and proximity to the shops.

We especially appreciate the shuttle service to and fro the beach front area. As mentioned before, the staff at the beach (Eka) was especially helpful and patient with all our needs. However, it would have been better if the shuttle was on a standby basis, rather than running on a schedule - much more convenient - although we also understand the perspective of the hotel mgt.

Another aspect of the hotel that we didn't particularly like was the lack of freshly laundered linens - unlike some other resorts we've stayed in previously - although this may seem an idiosyncrasy and may be brushed aside easily.

Bottomline, we're in the midst of making another booking for another stay with The Haven next month! =)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2252,Fabulous Experience,40,February 2011,"MY friend and I wanted a quick getaway and since I was In Indonesia, Bali was the destination of choice.

We checked into the Haven when we first got there and loved it immediately. The stuff were great! They were attentive, efficient and completely on the ball,

Unfortunatley due to a lack of space we had to check out after a few days and ended up having the worst experience at a place called the B Villas. Where we were horrified by the their treatment. We then decided to head back to the Haven to try and see if they had any vacancies. They were as expected superb and organized something for us immediately!

I actually asked to meet the G.M. as I wanted to tell him how great our experience had been. He was highly appreciative and incredibly responsive and prodded us to give him some feedback as to how they could further improve themselves and continue to provide us with an international standard of service.

Top marks to them for making it such an incredible and pleasurable stay!

My only thing is that the dining area and food needs some working on but otherwise its a lovely experience and great value for what its is.

So to all the lovely staff at The Haven, Thank you once again! We hope to be back soon!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2253,Perfect for our one day stay,40,April 2011,"We stayed only one night in this hotel, as we needed a hotel for one night before our flight back home. As we had just been to beautiful resorts in Ubud, Canggu and Gili Trawangan, we were a bit skeptical of what awaited us at this hote, but when we arrived - we were pleasantly surprised.

The room was modernly decorated. Balcony however had a bad view (but we did not spend much time on our balcony anyway). Bathroom and room are separated by glass doors... so a bit of a lack of privacy, but ok. The Restaurant looked great, although we did not visit it. The front area of the hotel was ok for a drink, but the traffic is a bit much after a while.

Best aspect about this hotel - it was in a good location to walk to nearby shops. For us, a perfect choice for a one-night stay. I am not sure if we would plan our vacation at this hotel, since I dont imagine it would be the most relaxing and quiet place to be.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2254,Great Stay,50,April 2011,"Stayed in a one bedroom suite,2 adults and one 3 year old; it had all of the facilities you would ever need. The rooms are cleaned to a great standard and the bed is one of the best I have ever slept in. From the time of checking in to getting a taxi to leave the staff were polite, friendly and helpful. THe pools are great, especially if you are a bit averse to the sunburn. We will definitely stay here again.
The location allows quick access to many great places to eat.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2255,Not impressed,30,May 2011,"Don't know where to start with this place.

Check-in took 20 minutes. I was presented with a welcome drink. Nice touch but the drink was not to my tastes. Judging from the number of half full glasses in the reception area, many people shared my opinion.

The bellboy came with me to the room, manages to open the door after three unsuccessful attempts and what do we find? The room is still occupied. Turns out that the front desk misread the occupancy plan. The bellboy wanted me to wait in front of the room, which I refused to do as I did not want to hang around in front of someone else's room while they sorted things out. We go back downstairs and it takes them a further 10 minutes to find a room for me. They then put me on the side of the hotel close to the road and the restaurant. I had specially requested a room away from all the hustle and bustle. I didn't bother to ask to be rehoused as I was sure that it would not have been done quickly.

The food in the restaurant is absolutely awful. I read reviews on here and had no plans to eat there. However nature did not cooperate, there was a terrible thunderstorm and I was forced to have dinner at the hotel. There was a barbecue buffet on that night. The food was of a very low quality and tasteless. Dreadful. It was the worst meal I have had in Indonesia, without a doubt. There was a buffet breakfast which was included in the price of the room. Again, horrible. I love my buffet breakfasts but I found it very difficult to eat that food.

The room itself is fine. Not fancy but not horrible either. I was slightly alarmed by the watermarks on the ceiling and one of the walls. Otherwise, the room was quite clean. There is a nice array of toiletries available as well. There is a good range of cable television stations and the wifi is free.

The location is very good. You are right on the main drag and pretty much everything in Seminyak is within walking distance (if you can stand the heat). However, please heed the comments of the reviewers and request a room away from the restaurant and the main road. The road gets very loud and stays that way. On a similar note, ask for a room away from the restaurant as well as the live music can get loud though it usually ends by about 10/ 10:30.

Check-out took a really long time as well (25 mins). The front desk staff seem overworked and not very sure about what they are doing. There was always about four or five couples waiting to check in or out. Every request seemed to become an intricate procedure. I found it frustrating.

The hotel seems to attract a youngish crowd (mid 20s to 30s) who are in Bali to drink and have a good time. The hotel can get very busy and very loud. All in all, the hotel has a very mass produced feel about it. You are not made to feel special. You are merely one of many guests at hotel. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of R&R or anyone who is particular about service or hotel quality. It was barely worth the discounted rate I paid.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2256,Great holiday experience.,50,May 2011,"I can not recomend this hotel more highly it was absolutly fabulous. I travelled by myself, and it was my first time at the hotel, and I can recomend it to anyone who wants a great holiday, especially a holiday to relax and use the spas, I was made so welcome by all the staff who work there, espcially Budi who is a pool attendent, he was so good and always smiled, and made me feel at ease being by myself, he also kept all the hotel guest amused with his ball on a rope excorsise, so many guest tried it and it was a lot of fun.. the waiterstaff were also friendly, Yue M'niez, was so sweet always smiled and made me feel like I was a member of her family and not just a guest at a hotel, I have only mentioned two staff members who made me feel totally at ease and made my stay at the haven comfortable, I live in Perth Western Australia, and if the staff in the hotels here were as proffessional, and friendly that would be something, I cant thank them enough really that is how great the holiday was, Thankyou Haven and the hard working people who made my holiday unforgetable.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2257,"Groups not welcome, resort is suited for couples and people wanting a quiet atmosphere",30,April 2011,"This resort should be clearly advertised as a ""retreat"" and should advise group bookings of their ""no party policy"". We were a family booking of 14 adults and 4 children (children ranging from 1yr-12yr), we went to Bali to celebrate a 70th birthday. All our family were impressed with the size of the villas and the suites. The rooms were well equipped and clean. Caution, floors throughout the hotel are extremely slippery, we had several family members slip and fall. The hotel location is well positioned for shopping and eating, a taxi ride into Kuta is approx 25,000 rupiah and taking either 25 or 40 minutes depending on traffic conditions. The two pools (one in the front and one in the back) are mostly in shade the entire day - both pools lacked food/drink service. There is a makeshift bar reception where staff will take your order, if they are there, most orders took some 20-30 minutes on average, with some taking 1hr. The atmosphere encouraged at both pools were ""quiet"" and infact the whole resort had a more of a tranquil feel rather than encouraging people to hang around the pool area and chat. There is a large sign at the reception desk and in the rooms advising that group gatherings in the resort rooms was against Seminyak culture and was discouraged. If you are looking for a quiet, tranquil resort then this is the one. If you are after a fun atmosphere and wanting to freely chat and have some fun in the pool and laze about the resort, this IS NOT the resort you want to go to, we definitely felt that any noise made was a nuisance. It is worth noting that there are two reception areas, if you have booked a villa or suite, you will need to go to the rear of the hotel, there is a laneway to go down and taxi drivers are aware of this second entry, otherwise it is a bit of a walk going through the resort from the front to back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2258,Wonderfully comfy bed - wanted to bring it home.,40,April 2011,"Got a good rate in Dec last year for our stay over a peak period (Easter). Upgraded to a suite on arrival which is at the back of the hotel and has access to an additional pool and breakfast area. Brekky was nice - standard Western/Asian buffet with egg station and pancake station. Coffee machine at breakfast - barista coffees extra. Sweet, friendly staff. Deluxe suite was nice, good air-con, balcony, plasma, bed was sooo nice and comfy. Mini bar fridge tiny. Supermarkets close by. Great restaurants and warungs in the vicinity.
Double sun beds were lovely. Back pool does not get much sun, which suited us but some people who like to fry would be better to lie by the front pool. Clean, tidy, grounds and gardens. Timber around the resort could do with a bit of maintenance.
Location good - more Legian though than Seminyak proper. Internet computers get busy (only 3). Never any paper in the printer. Would stay again for the price.
The only thing we didn't like was the Haven Beach Club. There was supposed to be a shuttle bus to the beach (never saw on) but it is only a 10 min walk to the beach. The Beach Club is just a couple of sun lounges and an umbrella, a toilet with no paper and get your own drinks. The beach boys are polite but it is a bit of a stretch to call it a 'Beach Club'! Be careful in the afternoon as the giant speakers come out and the doof doof music is fired up on top volume. Be warned - time to go home then!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2259,"Good hotel, but not sure for how long",40,April 2011,"Was trying to find a reasonably priced hotel in the Seminyak area, and Haven looked tempting, given the pre-paid prices available on their website or through travel agents. The hotel lived up to the expectations - modern and a bit chic, perfect for adult couples and not too many children running around. Stayed in a Haven Room.

Pluses
- Very bright room
- LCD TV with plenty of international channels to stay connected to world events.
- Very long pool for lap swimming at the hotel end of the property and very airy. The pool at the suite end felt claustrophobic - they built the suites too close to one another.
- Only 10 minutes by foot to the beach. Dedicated Beach Club for guests at the Haven so one does not have to rent lounge chairs. However, they claim they have a shuttle to the beach, but every two hours is simply not frequent enough.
- Internet corner behind front desk.
- Close proximity to Bintang Supermarket to buy souvenirs, fruit, beer, water, as well as to the famous warungs.
- The rooms are very quiet, particularly if you are far away from the main entrance. The music coming from the restaurant would not bother you, unless you stay in the three rooms on each floor that overlook the restaurant.

Not so great
- Instead of building shower cubicles, they actually built bath tubs. I am 178 cm tall and I found a bit challenging to climb into and out of the bath tub. Imagine less vertically enhanced and more seasoned (age wise) guests.
- Selection of breakfast items mostly catered to western palate.
- Not enough lounge chairs / tanning beds along the pool. Mostly filled up by 10am. However, I tended to go swimming at 8am, have a bit of tan near 830am, before going to breakfast so it worked out fine.
- Paint around the hotel is indeed coming off as commented by other reviewers, despite the age of the property, and it is almost impossible not to notice this. On the day of checking out, I noticed water creeping up on the floor tiles behind the room door. Peeked outside and it was not the housekeeping staff washing the floor. I thought to myself, ""the bathroom could not be leaking could it ?"" As I left the room, noticed that there were water marks / puffiness on the outside wall facing the corridor at probably about the right height from where the plumbing of the toilet and the bathtub would be, and paint was coming off. As I walked towards the elevator, noticed that more than half of the rooms had similar issues, right at the very same level.
- At check out, they had to inspect the mini-bar before letting me go. Typically most hotels would simply take your word that you did not consume from the minibar. While waiting, the lady standing to the left commented to the staff that her room was now better than the first room she was in and did not have the smell anymore. I am almost wondering if this could be related to potentially leaking plumbing. My room did not smell at all.
- Some of the tiles inside the room already had cracks in them.

Really, the last few points should not be attributed to the hotel management per se, but rather to the quality of the workmanship as well as selection of material during the design / building phase. There seems to be some fundamental issues related to the workmanship of the construction, and unless they properly uncover and fix all these issues, I can only imagine that the place would look dilapidated in a couple of years' time. I saw touch up paint work being done quite frequently during my stay, but this simply does not solve the root cause. ( I just renovated the apartment that I am living in and leaky plumbing was one of my worst headaches as prior to the renovation, paint was coming off because of plumbing problems.) I truly feel sorry for the hotel management to have to deal with all these construction issues. I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel, but I am not sure it would look the same next time I visit Bali should I decide to stay in the same establishment again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2260,Highly recommended for the Aussie traveller,50,April 2011,"Great spot as it is not in the hustle and bustle of Kuta, but only a 20-30 minutes stroll.
From the bar it is a great place to people watch, while having a Bintang. The food is good and the prices are reasonable.
The staff are very curtious and friendly, nothing seemed a problem, they have security 24 hours and I felt safe as a solo traveller. Lovely pool and amenties, the rooms are plain and stylist with good hot water. I had clothes laundered through the Hotel and would have gladly gaven them my bag to pack as they clothes came back ironed and packed really to be packet in a suitcase.
Breakfast is great, I read few comments prior to my trip about the breakfast and truthfully, the only thing I could fault was the tea was very weak. (If that is my only fault after a week, I must be picky) Breakfast, you can have omlets, pancakes, waffles,continential, fresh fruit, pastries and so much more, so I can't really work out what people had to complain about.
Outside the hotel you have a Circle K (7-11) a few doors up, and about 150 mtrs up the road is a chemist and supermarket and all the clothes, shoes and bags that you can think of in between. Taxis are not a problem as they always dropping and picking up people. the Haven also has onsite tour operators for booking tours. Overall, I am picky with accomodation, and I will glad recommend and will return to The Haven again",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2261,"Friendly and helpful staff, very clean, will definetly be going back",50,August 2010,"The hotel was very nice. Rooms were modern and clean, pool was beautiful. Breakfast was average, but there are plenty of good quality restaurants near by.

My sister was pick-pocketed in Kuta one night and we reported it to the hotel who were excellent. They took us to the police station in their car and translated for us when we made the police report. They were very helpful and understanding and couldnt do enough for us.

If you are after a party-style hotel this is not the place, its a more relaxing, couple-type hotel.

I am going again next month and wont hestitate to stay at the Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2262,BRILLIANT WARMING EXPERIENCE IN A GREAT SUITE WITH GREAT FACILITIES AND LOCATION,50,February 2011,"This hotel is everything from elegant, trendy, quiety, funnky, relaxing, in hot spot location close to the beach!!

Our room was impeccable! It was a self contained unit on the ground floor overlooking the pool. The bed was luxurious and pillows extremely comfortable! Got rid of all the nicks in my neck!

The service was extremely professional and always available at a drop of a hat. Nothing was too hard for the staff - and always welcomed with a warm smile by ALL- from front desk, to cleaning staff and grounds people!

Location was brilliant - close to the major shopping district with the beach within walking distance.

WE LOVED THE DINING EXPERIENCE - A GREAT BAND of 4 guys who could sing ANYTHING - FROM GREEK TO LATIN!!! We were serenaded and had one of the best nights we could have wished for! Things you see in movies!!!

Highly recommended to anyone wanting to stay in Seminyak - it is family friendly and caters to everyone - from the singles to couples, and families with children!

The villas are gorgeous - suggest sharing with a group of people or perfect for

Carefull with alcohol prices in the restaurant - a little pricey compared to other parts of Bali - but the experience is well worth it!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2263,rather new hotel on a good location,40,March 2011,"Located directly on the main road has the advantage of been flexible regarding your activities but also brings along a lot of street noise. So if you book state your request of having a room towards the beach, if possible in the second building behind the pool and villas. The beach is in walking distance (10-15 min) and being in the south of Seminyak it is the perfect spot four trips to the north, south and east. The room I stayed in was clean and furnished in a minimalistic, rather urban style. As mentioned there is quite a bit of noise coming from the street & bars and due to the poor isolation you can easily hear most of it. Nevertheless I slept perfectly also due to the good quality of beds. Skip breakfast unless you really need to fill your stomach. The fitness center is small room with only the very basic machines and weights. Taking the price in consideration it is a rather good value for money, but don't expect a 5-star treatment.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2264,great stay bali,40,February 2011,"i arrived close to midnight after 22hrs flying, check in was quick and helpful and came with a very pleasant upgrade to a suite. Situated at the quieter rear of the hotel. lounge dinning area was a very generous size well furnished and nicely laid out. large balcony for lounging close to home. Bedroom was also generously furnished with a second large tv with a sat package to suit all. Bathroom was in keeping and spotlessly clean.
Breakfast covered all tastes, nicely delivered in the rear garden area.
Lots of hotel staff on hand, all keen to help and friendly. Despite some extensive rebuilding on the top floors this was never intrusive.
pools at the rear and front were kept well gardens and general layout were restful. Hotel never seemed busy despite my stay including a local holiday weekend.
We stayed for six nights and found this an idea place to stay. I would recommend the suite if possible. it would certainly be at the top of my list for my next visit.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2265,The suites are nice but check-in was unprofessional,40,March 2011,"My wife and I recently stayed 7 nights in a 1 bedroom suite, which we booked back in August '10 via a popular travel company's website...we paid a lot less for the suite than what's being offered on The Haven's website, so shop around for the best deal.

Check-in is advertised as '2pm'...we arrived at 4pm and was told that our room wasn't ready and we should come back at 6pm...WTF! We went for a walk and a bite to eat and returned at 5.30pm...room still not ready so they put us in a deluxe room till our suite was ready; eventually at 7pm we get our suite.

I reported this to our travel agent who emailed the Haven and they then offered us 2 complimentary massages at the in-house spa...don't know that we would have been offered anything for the check-in debacle if we hadn't told our travel agent.

Ok, some positive stuff now...the staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great; a huge range of cereals, toast, hot food, eggs done the way you want, pastries, pancakes, waffles, juices, plenty of tea & coffee....you wouldn't go hungry!
The pool area is very nice and so is the pool....only downside is that it closes at 9pm. Too bad if you want to go for a swim after you've been out for your evening meal, so that's a bugger, as we missed out on a couple of late night swims because of the 9pm close.

Yes, it's nice having 32"" LCD TV sets but because the reception is very poor, it makes watching TV thru the 'snow' a less than pleasant experience....the DVD player worked a treat, though.
The 'fully equipped kitchenette' actually comes empty and if you want any cooking utensils or cleaning items, you have to ask for them at reception...something minor but a pain, all the same.
The suites are HUGE, so spend the extra and bypass the hotel rooms...you won't be disappointed; I'm so glad we booked a suite.
Just be careful getting into and out of the shower bath...the ledge is quite wide and the grab rail seems a bit flimsy.

All in all, we enjoyed our time at The Haven and would recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere quieter to stay than Kuta....the walk along the beach to Kuta was good exercise (20 mins) and the supermarket is only 300m north along Jalan Legion. Cafe Seminyak, located in front of the supermarket does nice cakes, too.
The Chinese & Indonesian eatery down along Jalan Double Six is cheap and the food is good...we ate there a few times.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2266,Perfect getaway for couples,40,March 2011,"Stayed there close to a week. Initially a bit skeptical from the photos...but turned out to be a great experience, great staff, great set-up and very comfortable stay. Improvement can made on the breakfast and coffee...:)...besides that, got a great deal. Recommended to escape the hustle and bustle...if you in Bali on a ""party on"" theme, this place not recommended, it's chilled out an you'd be a nuisance instead...
Cheers and have a great holiday...",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2267,"Think of a Prison. bad design, service and size. Poor value",10,November 2010,"The only good thing about this hotel is probably the lap pool for those who want one.

The hotel is big in it's proportion, so you dont get any intimate and local Balinese flavour like you do in most hotels. Luckily i only spent one night there but even for that it was not worth it.

The hotel looks like a prison. Whoever designed the property, bravo to you for making a hotel in Bali look like a prison. How hard could it have been to design otherwise?

The staff seemed incompetent, demotivated and not connected at all with what they were doing and to understand the guests. Thank god i didnt eat the the breakfast buffet, I am sure it would have spoiled my trip with food poisoning.

The room as well is trying to hard to look like a hip hotel but it doesnt take much to realise that it was poor planning. Specially the bathroom.

Likewise it seemed they even target the kind of clientele who dont really have much taste in good hospitality. At night when I was in the balcony for a while, we saw probably 5-8 groups of people walking in drunk and making a racket. Even the senior citizens.

Definitely would not recommend.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2268,"GREAT PLACE, WOULD STAY AGAIN",40,March 2011,"We have a few minor issues when we booked into the hotel, in that the staff put us in a twin room when we should have been in a queen, then quickly relocated us to an extremely noisy room - but after a meeting with the manager the next morning, we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was fabulous!! Huge beautiful King sized bed, modern bathroom, kitchen and loungeroom area with a big flat screen TV and DVD player, airconditioning and a little balcony overlooking the pool with its own day bed. Because we'd gotten married recently they also gave us all the honeymoon inclusions too. The Breakfasts were AMAZING! We over indulged everyday and loved it. The staff were very friendly and helpful, massages at the hotel were great, pool was lovely. Overall we were really really happy here and would recommend it. The hotel rooms are very small, and it's worth paying a bit more for a suite if staying for more than a few nights.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2269,Hard to say ...,30,March 2011,"I found myself confused as to wether or not I liked this place.

Here's the rundown:

Staff - GREAT (Typical of Bali)

Pools - very nice

Food - very average and a little pricey. Also 24hr room service isn't 24hrs (finishes at 10.30) but no deal breaker as the restraunts near by are great

Location - see below re noise but otherwise a very handy location

Room - this is where it gets tricky. I stayed in the hotel side for the first 2nights and I wouldnt stay there again as it was so noisy. I'm not one to goto bed early (well after midnight most nights) but the road noise made a decent sleep impossible - and I'm a heavy sleeper ! This room was nice and clean though so no complaints other than the road oh and wifi wasn't useable.

For nights 3 to 5 I then got moved to a suite which was much quieter. Wifi strong and close to the pool. Unfortunately it wasn't too clean (scum and sand in bath tub and surfaces appear to have only been very quickly wiped over)

The bathtub was however cleaned after the first night in the suit but I found my replacement towel to be badly stained.

I still havent decided if I would give this place another go - maybe in a suite but definately not a hotel room.

I guess you get what you pay for but having stayed at the lokha on jl padma before I would easily choose the lokha over the haven any day.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2270,Good hotel,40,March 2011,We stayed on the suites side. The hotel was modern and clean. The location is on a bustling small street with lots of shops and resteraunts in easy walking distance. Breakfast buffet was western and very good. The only negatives were that the in-room wifi was spotty and the AC was not working properly at first (they fixed it).,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2271,EXCELLENT HOTEL IN ALL WAYS (aimed at couples),50,March 2011,"We arrived March 18th, and left on 25th March. This was for the cost one of the best holidays we've ever been on. on arrive we were greated by a very helpful and informative 'bali experiance' staff member, we were also given compimentry flower necklasses and water. Transfer was only 30mins to seminyak, and hotel was excellent. We did stay in the 'HAVEN SUITES,' not the hotel. They are the same hotel but at different ends of the complex. You can go to both parts but you can just stay in your end if you like. All hotel staff are as friendly as can be,helpful and extreamly respectful. Again drinks and towels on arrivel and a swift check-in. The suite was perfect well worth the upgrade. you get a full kitchin, lounge, and dinning areas, large outside seating areas over looking the pools, and the bedroom is beautiful. the en-suit bathroom was great with a condiments pack. The breakfast was also great with a full range of hot, cold and savory items. Some real minor issues, the shower was now very powerful and there are some mosquios that the plug-in they provide didn't kill. The spa is was very expensive for what you get, it is worth abit more than the street spa's but definity not the 6 or7 times more they charge. i had a duo massage but only have two massuses for is 45min of the 1hr i paid for and it felt a bit rushed. You do also have to be very careful of the (plus, plus system ++) they all use though out bali. 10% Tax, in all places, and 11% service in tourist places like the hotel, added to the final cost of your bill. It can work alot more than you thought the bill would be. All shop, and taxi owner can be very pushly for your service, just be strong and say no. the bartering over there is around 80% off the shop's orignal price, sunglass 350rph we got for 40rph. street spa's are worth every penny, very cheap (around $7 for 1hr.) the excurtions were all brilliant and well explained by the Rep that meets you the following morning and he gave us a big discount on booking them all together.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2272,In general good at all parts except cleaningness,30,February 2011,"It was my first trip to Bali and I decided to stay in Seminyak, not as over-exploited as Kuta nor as local as ubud.
Getting a villa in semiyak with 4/5 star hotel service and facility with a decent price was too difficult. After comparing the comments on a few OTA, I choose the heaven.
The hotel looked great at the first glance, you could require a room facing the swiming pool as long as the hotel is not fully occupied. The view is somehow breathtaking. The hotel staff is generally very nice, only a little bit less organised. The room is spacious so does the bathroom. However I did not feel very comfortable with the room because of cleaniness.The floor is a little bit dusty and it gave me a dirty feeling because of the color of the floor. Also the bathroom did not fully cleaned up which is a big headache to me.
The lobby breakfast was lovely however the same thing happens on the food. the variety of breakfast is limited and the fruits is not that fresh.
It's all good except this part.
In general I have a good time with the hotel and bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2273,scared,30,March 2011,im supposed to spend next week at the haven but after all the bad review i have read on this website im a bit scared of the quality of the hotel and the room finger cross and i hope for the best and maybe next week i can change the post with better things to say,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2274,Would stay again,50,February 2011,"This hotel is only 2 years old and is still getting some finishing touches, none of which are disruptive. We stayed a week for our honeymoon and were looked after very well. It is on the main drag that goes from Seminyak to Kuta (JL Legian) and even though is wasn't near to the beach, about a 10 minute walk or they do have a free shuttle and their own day beds on the beach, it didn't bother us at all.. It is surprisingly quiet at night in respect to been able to go to sleep which is a bonus...Great to be able to step out on the front walk way and shop where you like. If you turn left you can go to all the trendy shops, and to the right is more of the standard type stalls..It is close to alot of local restaurants and only a short (10,000 rupiah) ride from the main restaurants in Seminyak. Made Warung Seminyak is very close to walk to and great value and quality food. Rooms were very clean, and the air conditioners worked a dream very easy to control what temperature you like. Rooms modern, flat screen 40 inch TVs, Nice pool area. This hotel probably wouldn't suit people with small children as the pool area doesn't have a large shallow area. We met some wonderful people around the pool, and would definitely stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2275,"Pleasant, Good Location, Lovely Suites",40,March 2011,"Beautiful suites with self contained kitchen, tv in living room and bedroom, beautifully decorated with lovely deep bath to soak in. The suites and villas are located away from the hotel and main road so they're lovely and quiet with 2 pools and plenty of sun beds.

The mini bar stocks drinks only. There's no cooking utensils however the hotel can arrange these for you if you contact the front desk. Staff very friendly.

The complimentary buffet breakfasts were so so.

Biggest disappointment was manicure and pedicure. No foot soaks or hand soaks and massages. Just a quick buff, clipping and filing then paint. Considering it cost just over $65 AUD I was expecting much more. My partner had several 60 min and 90 minute massages and loved them. Much cheaper than my manicure and pedicure!

My partner went to the gym and said it was VERY small - a few weights and a couple of machines.

All in all we were very pleased with the Haven. It's much smaller and quieter than other hotels in the area and would suit couples or a group of friends who want to relax in gorgeous surroundings.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2276,"exceptional ...management, staff, location. value",50,March 2011,"I would rate this as the one of the best hotels I have stayed in, anywhere in the world as far as value for money.
The location is excellent....easy to get in and out of and good parking....close enough to Kuta....close to good swimming beach...close to some of the best restaurants in Bali.. eat street...Ku De Ta...plus endless amount of quality cafes. My stay was primarily business, but you cant work 24 hrs so at the end of the day...pleasure.
The service cannot be faulted.....the staff are very well trained in friendliness and helpfull ness. I do push the limits sometimes, but i never felt I was a nuisence.
If I decided to stay in for meals....room service... selection, quality and service very good. Or a meal at the restaurant was a very pleasant experience, with good vibes and a good meal....breakfast , lunch or dinner. Alawys live entertainment at night.
The pool.....very relaxing... or good for the early morning laps,
The rooms are very good size with every thing you could want and very clean, a good place to go and relax or just sleep.
the honesty of the staff....cant be disputed, I left my watch behind when I checked out.... I sent an email the next day asking if it had been found, 10 minutes later I had a reply to say the staff had handed it in......no fuss... no hassle....I got it back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2277,Inappropriate Staff & Grotty Surroundings,20,February 2011,"Recently my Husband and I escaped to Bali for a sneaky 4 day getaway. Having visited Bali on numerous occasions, we knew we wanted to stay in the Seminyak area. Seminyak offers a wide variety of accommodation options, we'd experienced the Villa style of accommodation (Kembali Villa's - AMAZING), beach front brilliance at The Anantara (so amazing!!) and thought this time we'd try the larger scale hotel experience. Based on a the positive word about town and what we thought to be a value for money room price ($110 per night) we booked The Haven.

Our check in experience was disappointing, no lovely face towel or fruity refresher, limited recognition of our booking or even who we were. After killing a couple of hours waiting for our 3pm check in we were finally guided to our room. En route I noticed a very grotty lift and mouldy, water stained chipped hall ways throughout the entirety of the hotel. Not a great first impression!

Our room was basic, however consisted of nice minimalist decor. The general cleanliness of the room, likewise with the whole hotel left a lot to be desired. Our complimentary fruit bowl was on its last legs, and subsequently we left this untouched and so too did the cleaning staff... for the whole 5 days! Not once did the fruit get replaced.

The poolside experience lacked any sort of holiday / resort energy. Limited pool lounges meant we often had to sit on the ground. There was no wait staff taking food or beverage orders making it pretty difficult to enjoy & relax in this environment.

The hotel's 'internet corner' consisted of two dated computers, operating at a snail pace. One screen had been vandalised and cracked and the overall impression was one of a internet corner you'd find at a back packers hostel. To access the internet a password from the front reception was required. One evening whilst my husband was having a lie in, I popped down to check a couple of emails. The staff at front reception, two young males were what I thought to be very attentive at first, asking me many questions about my stay, my room number, what I had been doing that day etc - then when I had to request three times for the internet password I realised their attentiveness was in fact more sleezy than helpful. When I finally received the required password, a ""you look very sexy tonight"" comment was thrown in for good measure.. Very inappropriate I thought, however brushed it off as perhaps being a language / cultural difference issue. 5 Minutes into my internet session, the man form the counter decided he pay me a visit and continue with his attempt to 'chat' me up. It got to a point where I was so uncomfortable I logged off and dropped the ""I'm here with my husband' line and promptly returned to my room. This sort of behaviour is inappropriate on so many levels and leads one to question the level of customer service policies that are actually in place at The Haven, if any!

In summary, our stay at The Haven was very disappointing. Bali has a great deal of quality accommodation options to suit all budgets, so do yourself a favour, do your research and avoid the Haven!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2278,Great place to stay...,40,February 2011,Was there a few weeks ago and had a great time. The staff were really friendly and helpful. It's about 7 mins walk from the beach and in a great area near restaurants etc. Will definitely be going back.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2279,Mostly a good hotel,40,February 2011,"Stayed in a one bedroom suite - lots of room and great balconey with day beds. House cleaning were shocking... Benches and floors weren't cleaned at all during our two week stay and the toilet and sink cleaned rarely. The suite pool was great and quiet, don't bother with the haven beach club... It was dirty and not somewhere you would spend time.
Breakfast was great, so make sure you eat up! Because room service and poolside meals and drinks are far too expensive... With a cocktail being AU$10.00 and a burger being AU$9.00. Big warning to wine or champagne lovers... They charged me $100AU for a bottle of terrible champagne. I quickly asked the price of everything after that!!!!!
Staff were very friendly and lovely.
The worst experience was that they booked two functions in a row down in the pool area.. These appeared to be promotional fuctions. They were loud and intrusive to guests in their rooms and in the pool as the rooms overlooked the area. One guest in particular became rude, and extremely loud and obnoxious... Despite 3 complaints from us they didn't manage it and it went on for several hours. but overall good hotel, recommend suites definitly and if you can afford it go a villa!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2280,"Terrible customer service, nice hotel and good location.",30,February 2011,"My partner and I visited Bali for 7 nights to celebrate our birthdays and I took my parents too for their first trip to bali. I wanted a 2 bedroom villa for us all to stay in together but also wanted a resort environment rather than a secluded villa on its own. I was quite excited about staying at the haven as it looks beautiful and especially excited about the 2 bedroom villa that I had booked.

Upon arriving at the hotel after our early flight at 8.30 am (no earlier check in offered at all) and had to come back at 2pm I was advised that they did not have the 2 bedroom villa (that I had booked 2 and a half months ago) available and were giving me a 'free upgrade' to 2 x 1 bedroom villas which is not at all what we wanted as we wanted to stay together not in seperate rooms. Not an 'upgrade' as such, just a more expensive option that didn't suit us anyway. They had basically given the villa that I had booked to someone else and really did not care that I was not happy and that I didnt want 2 x 1bdrm villas. No apology or anything. My holiday was not off to a good start.

I had booked in to the spa at the haven for the morning of my birthday for a pedi and mani for my Mum and I. It's not as cheap as a lot of bali places, but I was happy to pay for the convenience and expected great service for paying a bit more than places on the street. It was TERRIBLE. No foot bath or soak, barely a foot massage. My nails were chopped as short as they possibly could be and rather than filing my nails, the file was just dug in under my nails to cause discomfort.... and my nails didnt end up shaped and smooth. Then to the nail painting, messy and on some nails, my whole nail wasnt even painted. Completely unqualified. I was disappointed to say the least and couldnt wait for it to be over and be out of there.

We ate at the restaurant on 1 night and the customer service was also poor there.

I also had trouble with the front office when it came time to organise the airport transfer from the hotel to the airport that I had booked when I booked the accommodation. It took a phone call and being transferred to 3 different people before I had to visit the front desk and talk to them for half an hour to get them to organise it after telling me I didnt book it and that I should catch taxis and disagree on what time I should leave, it was terrible. Then they call my room at 11pm to confirm the airport transfer for the incorrect time.

On a good note, despite not being a 2 bedroom villa, our villa was nice, the bathroom was lovely. The cleaners were great. The workers around the resort were friendly.The rooms are quite noisy having a thatched roof - especially with aeroplanes and it seemed to be an effort getting our room service dishes collected.

I think that the front office customer service was appalling and I expect a lot more especially when paying US $370 a night. I won't re recommending the haven to any friends.

Tips - there is no where to plug an ipod in your room, so if you want music - take some ipod speakers. There are also no travel adaptors available at the hotel so be sure to pack one of those too.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2281,lovely place to stay,40,February 2011,"I just returned on Monday from a one week stay in the Haven Seminyak with a group of female friends. It was my first trip to Bali so I haven’t experienced other hotels there but I must say I was very impressed with this place.

Firstly the hotel grounds are beautiful; there are water features everywhere and lush greenery. The suites pool and day beds were fantastic and by far the most comfortable of any resort I have stayed at. I spent many relaxing afternoons by the pool in the suites area and it was a great way to unwind after a day of shopping.

The people at the hotel were lovely, friendly and helpful. From security to reception to people walking around the grounds, everyone was so nice and helpful which was a real treat.

We stayed in a two bedroom suite and it was massive, as noted by another review we had outdoor bed’s on the balcony, large LCD TV’s and air conditioners in each room with plenty of cable channels and seating areas. The bed was very comfortable and I had a great night sleep every night that I was there. I didn’t have a problem with light coming into the room so I am not sure what others are referring to and the room was very quiet.

The breakfast was great too; they had American style bacon (which we don’t get here in Australia and I LOVE) and eggs made to order. There was also a large selection of other hot and cold dishes.

I probably wouldn’t recommend the hotel for people travelling with children as it appears to be more of a place for adults.

Someone else has noted how there was not cutlery in the room which we also found a bit strange. We did discover though by reading the hotel information book that you can request to have cutlery put in the room if required. This seemed like a bit of effort for us so I would have preferred if the room just came with the cutlery.

Overall I would recommend this place to my friends and family and if I was to return to Bali would definitely consider staying there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2282,Really great value for a big hotel but lacking some of the Balinese charm of other hotels,40,February 2011,"This hotel has everything you need and is in a great location to explore southern Bali. Despite being on the main road of Seminyak the rooms are quiet and cool, all overlooking the pool. It does feel like a BIG hotel however and stands out on the street as a big place - not really for you if you're after a more traditional Balinese feel for your accom.
Good:
Location
Breakfast : )
Free wi-fi and internet corner
Very attentive, friendly and helpful staff (this does seem standard for Bali though)
Modern, clean spa with okay menu. Not that cheap as are most hotel spas.
Seemed very new and clean
Other points to note:
Restaurant and bar a little pricey, but standard for a hotel restaurant.
Automatically upgraded us to a suite for one night but this meant a bit of reorganising to check out and then into our regular hotel room the next day. However the suites did have some great features: Double size day bed on balcony and more furniture on the lounge room balcony.
No hot water in suite?
Tried to charge us US$70 for a sheet and pillow case that were stained by ink from my husband's new tattoo. This was reduced to $30 in the end though.

Overall a clean, new, well designed and efficiently run big hotel. It was pretty nice to come home to each night after the craziness of Seminyak and Kuta.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2283,Good location but lacking character,30,January 2011,"I stayed in a Haven room. Upon arrival I was told the room would be ready at 3pm but when I pointed out the website clearly stated 2pm I was suddenly found a room by 1pm?! The Haven room itself was fine - large bed, good bathroom. Some problems with the toilet being blocked but they fixed it quickly. There are signs of wear and tear like cracked flooring. They have free WiFi and also a computer corner with 2 computers for which one gets 30 minutes free a day, but always one or the other wouldn't work. Staff is friendly enough. It is good that Hotel people can use the pools from the Suites and Villa area because they are much nicer and more quiet. The hotel feels a bit like one of those huge blocks and doesn't really have much character. The restaurant is incredibly loud at night with music and street noise. Great location close to everything. You can forget their ""Beach Club"" though. A long walk for not much when you get there. Reception staff don't speak much English and their telephone system lacks signal strength so you get cut off often.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2284,Greta value,40,January 2011,"We just had 8 days in a suite. Found the staff very attentive and genuine, the accommodation (in the suite) was spacious (although we don't understand why we would have cooking facilities without utensils?) (but so cheap to eat out who cares), the suites being at the rear were quiet and peaceful. The location was very central to everything you could wish for.

The only (very minor) issues would be the lack of internet access, how expensive would it have been to offer guests free access to the internet? after all most cafe's on the streets did; the amount of light that intruded the suites through the bathroom window from the corridor lights was a pain but easily fixed by piling the spare pillows onto the shelf above the vanity.

Generally; affordable, clean, new, spacious and friendly. We will definitely return.

One other thing to remember if you like your wine. In Bali its expensive as its classed as a luxury item and charged with a ridiculous tax so take your own, but remember you are limited to one liter per person. The four of us took in 2 liters each and when this was discovered by customs at the airport we were ""slugged"" $40AUD cash directly to the senior customs officer in full view of everyone and no receipts! Still worked out worth it but a pretty funny experience all the same.

Would go back without question and would definitely stay there, unless you were looking for a resort style accommodation.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2285,5 rooms in 3 days,20,January 2011,"I took my 16yr old son to Bali, and booked the Haven on recommendation from a colleague. I had booked a twin share room as we were there for 3 nights only. Upon arrival at midday, we were told we had been upgraded and to go to reception at the other end of the hotel. When we got there, whilst the staff were polite, the room was not ready. They asked us to come back in 3 hours after just arriving! Upon returning, our room still not ready, they put us in a temp room until, supposedly, 7pm. wrong again. We stayed in temp room, but they moved us at 10pm to one exactly the same! Only difference being 'our room' had had probes with the bathroom, which clearly had not been resolved. The bathroom was reeking within a few hours but we could not get any action. The following day the toilet and drain were clearly not working. We reported the smell 4 times.then the zircon packed it in. We spent night 2 rather uncomfortable to say the least. The following day, after again getting no response my son seemed to get some action (it took at teenage boy rather than his mother to get action). We were to be moved to another room, which we waited until 6pm for. We walked in and it was a king bed, clearly unacceptable. So, after more micking around, we finally ended up in our 5th room, back where we started! And by they way, the upgrade was simply a room at the back of the hotel, still twin share as we had booked. We won't be back. Very disappointed with the facilities and the whole experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2286,Good hotel with spacious room for family,40,January 2011,"We were pleased with most aspects of the hotel. We paid a very small charge for an adjoininhg room to make our room a 2 b/room suite which is great with children. The staff are friendly. The location is good - resaonably close to lots of restaurants and of course shops. The beach area where the hotel has lounges was very, very dirty when we were there possibly due to the storms but I would have rathered the hotel tell us that before we were taken there (and perhaps recommend that we not go at all). Breakfast was good - big selection to choose from and quite good for a buffet style. Guest relations were very helpful in getting me in touch with a tour. I was however annoyed at the check out when they made a big fuss of having to ""ïnspect"" the minbar. We had drank a bottle of their water in error rather than our own and they even brought the ""ëvidence"" to us!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2287,what a great quiet great location hotel,40,January 2011,"stayed here for 8 night great rooms great location.
the rooms were spotless clean, the only thing they have a tiny ant problem but no dramas really.
the only negative was the breakfast at the suites section there never seemed to be enough food you always had to ask and wait so we just went up to the main breakfast area which really wasnt a huge problem.
would definatly stay here again, more of a couples hotel not much for kids to do and pool not that big",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2288,Great location for shopping,40,January 2011,I have just returned from 5 days at The Haven. It is a chic little hotel- very western style. Located right in the centre of a great shopping district. I wouldn't stay here for a lengthy relaxing resort type holiday as the pools are quite small and the front one particulalry not very private and also because it's in a very busy location. The beach is about 10 minutes walk away but not very nice and not somewhere you'd lie out on a towel!.But fabulous for a few days so you can walk out the front door and get shopping. Also lots of great restaurants in this area.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2289,Fabulous,40,January 2011,"Stayed in suite with 16 year old son and his 17 year old friend. Son had his 17th birthday while there. came back from shopping to find birthday card and cake in room - lovely. Rooms very clean and comfortable. Really enjoyable stay. Stayed in Kuta last year, but will definately be back here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2290,Fantastic......,50,January 2011,My girlfriend and I stayed in the Hotel section of the Haven from 6/1 to 13/1. I have travelled throughout asia and can honestly say this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The rooms were very tidy and the gave us a room towards the back of the hotel so it was relatively quiet. Not too far to beach and cheap cabs to kuta and legian.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2291,"Great Location, Pleasant Staff, and Relaxing",40,December 2010,"My daughter and I spent three nights at The Haven and found it to be most pleasant. We had a slight mix-up with our accommodations but it was pleasantly resolved. We had a suite which was very comfortable and a full breakfast came with the room. The suites are located in the rear of the hotel, so it was very quiet. We had several meals and found the food and service to be satisfactory and pleasant.. Most evenings we found other restaurants close by to have dinner. The spa was wonderful and very relaxing. We really did not spend that much time in the hotel except to sleep.and have breakfast. The beach is not that far which we walked to and the hotel is really in the middle of everything, a lot of activity in the front entrance. The Haven is a new hotel and I would imagine they are still working out some of kinks. We found the staff to be friendly and attentive.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2292,Good in many aspects - Lacking in some,30,January 2011,"We stayed with 11 family members over the Christmas and New Year Break for 12 days. 9 of us in the hotel and my mum stayed in the suites.
We originally choose this hotel because of the location and the newness of the hotel. We were satisfied in this respect.
Make sure you request a double/king bed as one of our couples were in a twin share and due to the peak season it was really hard to change rooms and they weren't overly accommodating about the change.
Check in and the front desk were a little difficult to deal with at times.They just seemed to work really slowly and have a bit of attitude. It took us over 30 minutes to check out and pay for our bill.
Rooms were great. Clean and spacious and had all the modern conveniences.
Transfer service was good.
Food- Breakfast at the hotel was ok. Nothing flash. They didn't really cope when they were busy. Not enough cups, glasses etc. We had a terrible experience for Christmas dinner. They advertised for a traditional Christmas dinner with a Christmas Choir preforming.There was no entertainment.They served us mini hamburgers, chicken nuggets, mini pizzas, wedges and some salad. The food was cold and looked as if it had been cooked 12 hours earlier. They offered us a small discount in return for their false advertised. Let's say that is one christmas dinner we will remember
Under cover car park was great for my brother that had a scooter.
Mum satisfied in the suites. They were large suites and they had a better breakfast. They also had some one to cook eggs for them .
Overall, we enjoyed our stay and the few negatives i've mentioned didn't ruin our trip but would next time go some where else next time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2293,A good hotel with perfect location,40,November 2010,"I love the hotel for the quality and the location. The breakfast was awesome. The food at the restaurant was average and very pricey, adding around 21% mark up for tax and services. There are surely more affordable restaurants in the area. The swimming pools were tiny but nicely laid and cozy. The beach club (which is about 15 minutes walk from the hotel) is tiny and unfortunately closes before the sunset. At this moment the hotel looks great but we should wait and see after one year, as I can see the decays everywhere due to the lack of maintenance. It is a pity really. One tip: ask for the rooms far away from the street. You can literally hear the traffic in your room and it is non stop.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2294,Your Average Joe of a stay,30,November 2010,"My husband and I married in Bali 2 years ago and have been traveling to Bali several times a year over the last few years. We usually choose to stay in Seminyak and like to try different places.

Having gone pass The Haven many times on our scooter on previous trips, we decided to give it a try and booked it for 5 nights.

Upon arrival on a late flight, we were taken through the whole hotel and villa stretch to check in on the apartment block. I was glad we chose the apartments and not the hotel rooms as it was much more private and classier.

The check in was slow. Lady at reception choose to chat with a single male traveler rather than to attend to us quickly. Perhaps I was tired from the flight but she didn't seem to care too much.

When we were finally shown to our apartment, it was what we expected from photos we've seen at first sight. It was modern, not your everyday traditional Balinese style kind of resort. On closer inspection, we realise the aircon, showers were not working very well despite the building not being too old. I was really unhappy with the dirty marble floor of our room and called the room service to mop it while we ran out to grab supper.

When we returned, the floor was much cleaner. Day to day, I noticed that the housekeeping wasn't very clean. We had a bowl of half eaten noodles sitting in the sink and NOT CLEARED when we return in the evening. Did the housekeeper expect us to finish the noodles in the sink??!!

Calls made to ask for water was also attended to on some occasions and forgotten on others.

Breakfast was decent, we are not picky eaters. We chose to eat by the pool on the apartment side so it is quieter. Pool area is nice and well maintain.

Service staff are your usual Balinese friendly style but I have had much better services in many other cheaper or more expensive places we have stayed in Bali previously.

We really like the convenient underground parking for our scooter. Location is great to go anywhere on the scooter from Haven, beach, Kuta, Legian, Oberoi, etc. Food places were aplenty. On foot, you can find restaurants and shops easily just a walk away. Even Legian beach is a 5 to 10 mins walk away were you can find more restaurants, pubs and clubs.

The price of the rooms were reasonable but that's because we prepaid months before. You can find better in Seminyak unless you like modern looks for your stay. Keep in mind even though the rooms are modern, they are not very clean due to a lack-lustre house keeping.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2295,Fantastic accomodation in a great location.,50,December 2010,"We stayed in the Suite section of the complex. Rooms were well maintained, clean and airconditioning was very effective and could be set to your prefered temperature.Staff were very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast (included in the accomodation package) was a great start to your day, excellent variety, attentive staff and eggs cooked to your taste.
Will definitely stay here again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2296,Nice but not for families.............,30,November 2010,"Our stay at the Haven was soured by the fact that nobody no matter how quiet nor how much money you offered where allowed to stay in the pool after 8pm, and although this is clearly stated on signage near the pool , i would like to give people the heads up before they made there decision to stay there without realising the rules.

Having said that i would rate this a very nice hotel we had the top level corner ocean veiw 2 bedroom suite and i tell ya it was hugeeeee. Our kids enjoyed and interconnecting room fit for a adult with all the mods. My wife and i enjoyed a very spacious suite complete with a beautiful bed facing a magnificent bi fold doors over looking the beach. Very classy hotel . The staff was excellent and hoped they enoyed the fridge full of beer i left them in person. I wouldnt stay again however because the kids couldnt be kids so to speak .
To me this is more upmarket for business travellers or adults. Seminyak tho loved it..
Only other prob i had was working out how to operate the plug in the bath. Excellent bedding . Meals and drinks i suppose are realitively expensive however if your staying here you should be able to afford it.

Also make mention of the security at the front of the complex very top notch service , from stopping traffic for you to cross road to hailing down a cab to even helping with shopping and prams etc etc. They were well looked after too :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2297,A 'Haven' indeed!,50,December 2010,"Stayed 3 nights here and it has to be ranked one of the best hotels in Bali!

Everything from the friendly and helpful staff to the well-maintained rooms and excellent facilities meant by the end of our stay we did not want to leave. It is well-located with handy access to the beach too.

We thoroughly enjoyed our room so much we asked to extend our stay but unfortunately they were fully booked up.(frankly, we were not surprised). That is my only gripe really.

It represents excellent value for what you get - a great pool, decent gym, great buffet breakfast. Not to mention a lovely room with complimentary wi-fi, flat screen tv with up to 60 channels that all work plus a nice balcony overlooking the pool.

The restaurant/bar is a tad on the expensive side if you are travelling but not a problem as there are so many other alternatives nearby.

We will be back!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2298,no complaints,40,December 2010,"We stayed in the very spacious 2 bed pool villa. Essentially 2 separate villas in the one – split level living. We slept with our 2 young kids each in free portacots in top villa and granny slept in the bottom villa so had her privacy when she wanted to get away from us (perfect).
Top villa is huge, 3 rooms, lounge with plasma TV, bedroom with plasma TV and HUGE bathroom with indoor and outdoor showers. Bottom villa also generous (no separate lounge) with own plasma TV and big bathroom.
There is a top and bottom pool in the villa. Top pool is good size and bottom is more like a plunge pool.
All staff were very lovely and housekeeping great, new sheets and towels daily etc...

Breakfast is fine, we ate at the villa/suite section which is more tranquil than the top main street breakfast restaurant. Staff member Ryani at breakfast was a joy and is an asset to The Haven if management are reading this.
The Haven does cater for party goers in the hotel complex and there were often groups around the main pool which would be noisy and annoying for young families so wouldn’t recommend hotel accommodation for family stay (go for villa or suite).
The villa gives you best of both worlds, total privacy with the added bonus of all the hotel facilities so you never feel isolated unless you want to be.
The Haven is new and I think some of the workmanship in fact probably due to the humidity isn’t great (like cupboard doors breaking etc) but maintenance were there in a flash to fix anything so it was never a problem. The surrounding gardens are not as good and perfectly manicured as what I’ve seen in other Bali hotels. The walk to the beach is about 10 mins. The location for shopping and eating out is great.
All in all a good experience! Spent the extra on the villa, its worth it!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2299,Still fantastic the second time around,40,December 2010,"After staying at the Haven in May 2010 with friends, we decided to stay again this time around. My partner and I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, and his parents and younger sister stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. Both rooms were imaculate. Our room could not be faulted, everything was well presented and in good working order. The other room had several maintenance issues, however these were always fixed promptly and with a smile. Breakfast was fantastic, and caterered for all tastes. Would reccommend the Haven to anyone travelling to Bali. As far as we were concerned it is in a perfect location - travelling to Kuta is easy (about $3AUD in a taxi), but it is just far away enough that you can relax. Thanks again to the Haven for another fantastic stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2300,The Haven.... What an experiance,40,November 2010,"It was our first Bali trip, but not our last. The Haven and its staff were fantastic, the breakfast was nice and extensive, the bar and food were great. Just to sit with a drink and watch that traffic was worth every cent.

2302,An elegant holiday experience,50,July 2010,"The hotel is located in Seminyak, the posh part of Bali. The rooms are very well maintained & modern. The staffs are very helpful & friendly. I had an issue of an accidental broken glass on my return to room on the 1st day & the hotel instantly transferred me to one of their suites room. The hotel is an elegant & posh one in the area & the service is up to standard. The complimentary buffet breakfast was another pleasant one. The restaurant is also great, but a bit expensive. But the food I had there, made me feel no regrets for what i paid. It was really a pleasing experience in this hotel.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2303,Heaven at the Haven,50,November 2010,The Haven Hotel is by far the best hotel we have stayed at. Have nothing to complain about at all besides the music so early in the morning. Lovely room. Lovely service. Great food and lovely location. Everyone at the hotel was delightful to deal with. The girls at the Spa were great at massages. Enjoyed the various types of entertainment at the restaurant. Stayed in the hotel room but will definitely stay in the suites or villas next time. Nia from the restaurant was just an angel. So polite and always smiling. We will definitely be back at The Haven. No doubt about it!,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2304,"Great location, new & modern - recommended",40,March 2010,"I had a large group booking for my trip. Mostly happy with the condition of the hotel as brand new, very nice and modern design and located at nice shopping area in Seminyak. Getting about and hitching a cab is very easy. Perfect location and new. But air condition was the only problem - some rooms for my group have problem with the air condition - which was not working fine during the very hot month. Overall recommendable, but just make sure your room has good working air condition.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2305,The Heaven/Haven,40,November 2010,"The staff where very helpful, it was very clean modern and central to so much would recommend it to friends and will be coming back.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2306,great family stay,40,October 2010,"Great place to stay with good family deals! Clean, modern,comfortable 4 star. Staff very helpful & very good breakfasts! Great area for shopping/dining. Haven rear exit turn left, then right, a short stroll down Jl Arjuna/Double Six & you are at beachfront. Great restaurants all along here, try Zanzibar, CBreeze @(O-Ce -en Outrigger, fish to die for!) plus many more fantastic places to dine/drink, very reasonable costs. Front Haven exit (Jl Legian )left, 4 mins walk up to Bintang Supermarket with all you need! (new Carrefour Shopping Centre excellent & much cheaper for family food shop, just jump a Bluebird Taxi 7mins away shop away) 5min cab ride left, up to fantastic ""Eat Street"" restaurants Seminyak, try Rumours, Mykonos & many more. Taxi or walk right, down to Legian, try Mozzarella top of Jl Utara Padma close to Lokha Hotel) many more great bars/dining/shopping just down & turn left into Garlic Lane! Hope you enjoy this area as much as we did!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2307,average hotel,30,October 2010,"we stayed in 1 bed apartment which was very clean but not really set up for any self catering no microwave or toaster we were provided with a ""kitchen pack "" which was a pot knife wooden spoon and board . Our first hiccup was when we were checking in was told there was no bed for our 10 yr old she would share with us ! well no i dont think so but if we would like a roll away bed it would be an extra $40 us a night but when i originally booked was told this was all sorted but the hotel insisted we pay extra We also found the language barrier quite hard where as other hotels in bali we never have this problem . Sunbeds were very rare and extremeley hard to get people saved them all day from early in the morning so dont expect to get one too easy ! the location was great right near bintang supermarket which is very handy and great restaraunts down near beach especially zanzibar that was lovely Overall our stay wasnt this the best we have had in bali as we go twice a year and we love seminyak but prob would not stay at haven again .",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2308,An amazing place to stay,50,October 2010,"This was our first time to Bali so we were a bit anxious! From the moment we arrived at The Haven we were made to feel welcome. The staff were fantastic! They would have to be the most accomodating and polite people we have ever met! When I came down with the dreaded ""Bali Belly"" they sent fruit to our room to help me recover. The only thing that I would probably change on the next visit would be to get a villa instead of 2 seperate hotel rooms. This, however, did not affect our holiday in any way! Thanks again for such a memorable 1st visit to Bali.

Tara, Eddie, Addison & Daphne",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2309,Great stay - very comfortable,40,August 2010,"We were staying in a 1 bedroom apartment: modern, comfortable, spacious, western style. This is a great place to stay and to explore seminyak. Good location: near the shoppings streets, super market and some restaurants, tough 10 minutes walk (can be far with small children who tend to forget things in the room) to the beach. Even if we had an apartment with kitchen, there was nothing more foreseen than some plates and cups. So don't count on preparing a fast meal yourself. Room service was excellent, babysit service was present. Otherwise also in general the service is great, the staff really helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet and location is very nice. The pools are really pleasant but perhaps less adapted to small children. The big sunbeds are great, and most of the time in the shade. Internet connection was very slow, no wifi.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2310,Highly recommended,50,October 2010,"A friend and I stayed in a large ground floor 2 bedroom suite for a week and will recommend it to people we know travelling to Bali.
The 2 bedroom suites are large with 2 bathrooms, 3 plasma tv's and great access to the pool. The suites are located at the quiet end of the hotel unlike the hotel rooms but it is a short walk to access either pool or entrance, depending if you are heading to the beach or off shopping. Great location!
We couldnt complain about the breakfast and think it catered for everyone. Staff were very friendly although there were language barriers with some staff when we needed things. A few minor inconveniences such as our room card deactivating most days and our phone flashing as though we had messages, but these were minor things.
We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would happily stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2311,Nice Hotel & Lovely Staff butt,30,October 2010,"Nice Hotel & Lovely Staff

The Haven,
I stayed at the Haven Suites in October 2010 with my girlfriend for 8 nights. We arrived at The Haven on the October 19th and the first impression was WAUW. The Haven is a nice Hotel and the pool looked so nice.

At the Check-in we were informed that all the king-size beds were booked??? And that me and my girlfriend would have to sleep in two separate beds for to the first two nights. The staff ensured us that it was only for the first two nights and we said it was okay.

The first room they gave us was at the pool side. The design of the room was basic at a descent size. And here comes the downside, the insulation of the room was very poor. We could hear the people at the pool in the room and it felt like they were in the room with us. So I went to the reception and ask if they could give me a other room. And we got room on the third floor, with the same basic design with separate beds.

Now the comes the first night sleep, we could hardly sleep do too the noise that we could hear from the outside (insulation). The morning comes and the housekeeping bangs on the door, I don’t know with what butt they bang on the doors. I really hope the management does something about this, because that’s not the way to wake people up. After two nights we got the new room with the king-size bed and we accepted the noise.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome at all times. If there was a problem they would do everything to fix it and that’s why I like the staff from The Haven. The rooms where cleaned very day and in the night they do did turn down service.

Full buffet breakfast was included each day which was plentiful and varied catering and it was really good.

All in all, The Haven is a nice hotel in a nice location with very friendly staff",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2312,Quiet spot in busy town,40,August 2010,"We were upgraded upon arrival to a really nice suite. We thought the location was great, and we were happy that it was quiet compared to the rest of the city. The only negatives were that the beach was a bit far and there were very few lounge chairs for the hotel patron's use on the beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2313,modern and convenient,40,October 2010,"just returned from a week at the haven. i would recommend it for anyone looking for anyone seeking clean, modern and central accommodation.

we stayed in the 2 bedroom suites, which i was glad of as they were at the back of the property away from all the noise of the front lobby bar and the bustling main road.

i found the hotel design a little too modern for my personal taste - i would have preferred a much more authentic ""balinese"" vibe. the hotel felt very westernised and super modern. that said, the rooms were lovely and spacious with all the amenities you could want.

the breakfast was ""ok"". nothing to complain about really but it was an identical offering each morning, would have been nice for them to mix it up a bit.

drinks and food at the hotel were overpriced - as at any hotel. the hotel is close to endless food and bar options so this wasn't really a concern, i don't think anyone would expect rock bottom prices if they choose to eat and drink at the hotel (and those people really should get out more and see what else bali has to offer!!)

the staff were nothing but LOVELY. Very helpful and friendly.

overall, i would recommend this hotel it was clean, comfortable, spacious and central to everything we could want - but if you're after a more ""Balinese"" experience, it may not be to your liking.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2314,Nice place to stay,40,October 2009,"Great place to stay. Lovely staff awesome apartment style accomodation.
Only disappointment was no pool bar but they will bring you drinks by the pool.
Would be nice to see beach from hotel but its not in that position.
Not far from beach front great location.
All round great stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2315,Fantastic stay for all ages!! Value for money and very comfortable!!,50,September 2010,"I stayed at the Haven Suites in September 2010 with my mum (70 years) , my son 14 and his friend 18. Our stay was fantastic with all our needs catered for throughout our stay for all of our age groups. The lift access was great given the age of my mum. The security and concierge services were great.
The staff were very friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome at all times. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was awesome. It was very clean and spacious and the 3 airconditioners and 3 balconies were great and much appreciated at the end of each day. The king size bed in the main bedroom was so comfortable as were the single beds in the second room. The bathrooms were very clean and wellmaintained. The living area and kitchen were huge and comfortable also.
Full buffet breakfast was included each day which was plentiful and varied catering for many different nationalities. We loved the entertainment provided on most of the nights that we were there ranging from live music, fire dancers and balinese dancers etc . The grounds and pool area are well maintained and are very inviting. They are fully staffed with pool towels, books and drinks readily available if desired.
Perhaps the only negative comment that I can make is that the pools are only able to be used until 8PM. Although I understand that this is so that the pools can be correctly maintained, there would be nothing nicer upon returning to the hotel in the hot evenings after dinner than to take a quick dip in the pool. Perhaps this could be extended until 9PM or 10PM.
Thank you so much to all the wonderful staff at The Haven Suites for making our stay so realaxing and such a memorable one. I loved it so much that I am booked for another nine nights in December with my husband and children.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2316,Lovely Staff & Central Location,40,October 2010,"We stayed at the Haven Room on the top floor for five nights in Oct to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel is at a very handy location to shops including Bintang supermarket, BMC money changers, Sip Restaurant, Sicillian Spa, Chill & Prana Spa
(Prana will provide pick up & drop off to your hotel). The hotel itself is still very new & modern. Our room is clean & spacious. Breakfast is good with a good egg chef who will cook your egg to perfection. The swimming pool is part shaded which is perfect for my wife who hates to be in the sun. They also provide a small collection of books to borrow. The only problem we had was the air conditioning not working but it was promptly fixed after my wife contacted the reception.
The staff always greet us with a smile & attentive to all our needs. The hotel also provides 30 min free internet including wireless (They also provide 3 computers) so we can skype & keep in touch with our family everyday. This is a well run hotel & we will definitely return.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2317,No Balinese service,30,October 2010,"This hotel has great potential but falls down in a number of significant areas:
- food and beverage - everything we ordered, from the pool or at the restaurant - took a minimum of 20 mins to get the the table. One day by the pool, our drinks took over 45 minutes to arrive.
- the drinks are ridiculously overpriced ($10 for a martini which had about as much gin as my little finger)
- the pool towel lady was a nazi
- the hotel reception staff were entirely unmotivated to assist anyone
- we were travelling in a group (3 couples) - after 1 week, we realised that our keys could open the other 2 rooms' doors.
- the rooms were nice and clean however, (1) the aircon would not go below 24 degrees
(2) they were very very noisy.
- the hotel transfer was a sham. We had stuff stolen out of our bag on the transfer from the airport to the hotel, and on the way back, the van was not airconditioned.
There are a billion more opulent better serviced places in Bali to stay.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2318,great service,40,October 2010,"We enjoyed our stay at the Haven suites. The staff were very friendly and helpful . The rooms were very comfortable and stylish but too western looking for us. I would like to see more of a Balinese influence to the interiors. The fur throw on the bed was a joke in such a hot climate. A beautifil batik throw would have been enough to make the rooms feel more balinese. The only problem with the rooms was a leak in the ceiling at the airconditioners. This caused a constant drip on the foor and the timber ceiling and the floor were badly water damaged. There were other signs of wear in the rooms such as cracked tiles. This is surprising as the hotel has only been open for 12 months I think . We has a very enjoyable stay and the hotel is in a great location. The pool at the suites is fantastic, a great lace to relax after a busy day sightseeing. I am not sure if we would stay again as I worry that if the leaks are not fixed, the hotel will age vey badly. Perhaps this will be fixed?? I would warn friends of this with my recommendation",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2319,I'd love to come back again,40,March 2010,"we stayed for 5 nights, and maybe that's why we were upgraded to the suite room. =)
breakfast was pretty good, everything was great, but you would still have to walk for about 5-10 minutes to go to Seminyak beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2320,Fabulous Staff,50,September 2010,"This is a lovely hotel in the heart of Seminyak, close to shops and restaurants. The better side is on Jl. Raya Seminyak.The rooms are spacious and clean with all the expected amenities. The accomodation cost includes ahearty buffet breakfast with all tastes catered for. There is s lovely pool, over 20 metres long so you can do some laps or laze in the deck chairs. The Villas are much more luxuriou and this is reflected in the price difference.
The only negative is the very high cost of other meals and drinks.A two course meal for 2 with one bottle of wine cost in excess of 2.000.000 rupiah which equates to over $240. This cost seems even more excessive when many meals outside the hotel can be found for under 60.00 rupiah (about $7.50).
So stay ther have a great breakfast and wander close by for lunch or dinner",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2321,Great Resort in Bali,40,September 2010,"We stayed at the Haven Sept 2010 and loved it. Choice of rooms, exec rooms and Private Villa. It's very new with great service food and 4 pools. Situated on the corner of double six Jalan, a must if you want to treat yourself to a fairly newly established Resort.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2322,Modern Hotel with good service,40,September 2010,"The wife and I decided on a last minute holiday to Bali,,,,and on the date we could leave & return to Melbourne,... The Haven was one of the few Hotels available..... but the package was good so we took it on blind faith.
We had a late arrival but checkin was quick & smooth. The room was spacious, clean and modern. The En-suite included a large bath with shower overhead. The shower rose was the size of a dinner plate and the water was hot with plenty of pressure.... the wife was happy !!
The pools were great.... and although I've read a few reviews commenting on the lack of seating.... we had no problems at all.
There are only a few things I had concerns about..... the first being the cost of drinks in both the restraunt and the mini-bar. $15 is a bit much for a gin and tonic.... and $9 was also over the top for a mineral water.... so we brought our own drinks in...
We stayed on the 4th floor.... and if you're wary of heights.... the balcony handrail is far to low.... you wouldn't want to be out there after you've had a few drinks.
Finally.... there is a problem with dampness in the En-suite.... I'm in the building game and I picked up on it immediately. The En-suite smells a little ""musty"" and water stains are obvious on the floors and walls. This will be a major issue to the Hotel in coming years as it seems to be happening in ""every"" room.
All in all... we were very pleased with our stay at The Haven.... the staff were obliging and helpful.....would we stay there again ? ...... probably...... and we would recommend it to our friends..... at least in the short term.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2323,Would not go back,10,August 2010,"I stayed in the Seminyak with 6 girls for 7 nights in August. I am a university student from Canada and was looking very much forward to relaxing at the Haven. We stayed in the suites section. I forgot to put my cell phone in the safe the first night we arrived. The second day housekeeping came into my room to clean and stole my cell phone. The hotel has since fired the employee and is sending my cell phone back to me.

I regret to say that this is quite unfortunate because it costs a lot of money to stay there. I have had the inconvenience of buying a new phone and also without a phone while on holidays.

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2324,"Beautiful Grounds, Very friendly but not very traditional",40,September 2010,"We stayed at the Haven in the suite area in the beginning of September. We were very excited to read the reviews before we left and we had a wonderful time! The suite area is beautiful. They have a number of pools surrounded with lush tropical plants, pool side chairs for everyone and very attentive towel and drinks staff. The one negative comment I would make is that they are not real good at mixing the drinks and they are quite expensive (100, 000 RP approx 12 AUD) But the room was heaven! large lounge room with a flat screen TV, full balcony with day beds, the air con worked well and the bed was large and comfortable also with a flat screen TV! we had no problems with the cleaning staff, a few times we put the do not disturb sign on the door and they would always call us later on in the day to see if we wanted it cleaned or fresh towels etc. very attentive.
The staff were exceptionally friendly always smiling and saying good morning- the one down side is they didn't speak Indonesian and even when we greeted them with the local hello they would always Say ""hello"" back. I always enjoy learning a bit of the language when I am overseas so this was a bit sad :( the breakfast was also great with a huge selection and they even had Vegemite which was great!. Everything was clean and spacious and nothing was too much trouble for the staff, we were very spoilt! Our Driver Juni was GREAT! So if you stay ask the transport people for Juni, he will show you a great time for a reasonable price.

Sabene restaurant was delicious and good value for the hotel restaurant, the Spa was expensive approx 50 USD for a massage but it was relaxing and quiet- I would recommend perhaps going for one treatment there and then getting cheaper ones out in the town.

It is very modern, very clean and very exciting for a young couple like us.
Apart from the expensive, not very well mixed drinks! And the fact that they kept us waiting for about 15 mins while they checked the mini bar when we checked out, it was an AMAZING place to stay and would recommend it to any couples wanting a break and families who want a little slice of heaven in Seminyak.

We will visit again!!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2325,The Haven not for the long stay,30,September 2010,"We checked into the Haven hotel purely because we couldnt get anything else. Theres nothing much Balinese about this hotel. The staff are very good, friendly and very helpful,check In and Out was easy with a welcome drink and cool towel while we waited our turn, breakfast was sufficient, variety was good, and easy to obtain as long as you ate between 7 and 8.30 after that it was a bit hectic to get a table which is understandable. we were dissapointed in the pool which to us was more of a large water feature.The room we had was 4th floor, 2 small drawers to store clothes and a wardrobe that has a very bad water smell in it. so we lived out of suitcases for 14 days. Otherwise the room itself was quite comfortable. Noise carried up from the pool area, and open passageways, and for some reason there was always someone dragging furniture around and slamming doors between 11pm and 2am. The laundry service is very expensive and we found a very good service around the corner off double six. The Gym seemed sufficient, the free 30 minute internet access was a plus. I didnt think much of the location being neither here nor there in Seminyak / Legian. Shopping in the area was expensive and so were the restaurants and cafes. The beach club access left a lot to be desired, although close to a toilet and a short stroll to buy a much cheaper bintang than what the hotel had to offer. The late check out 6pm was great and so was the availability of a back room to store our baggage until transfers arrived.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2326,Troubles at check-in,30,September 2010,"The Haven is located on the busy street in Seminyak, which is convenient on the one hand and a bit hectic on the other. Our check-in procedure was very clumsy to say the least. Arrived at 12h30 and we were told we received an upgrade to a junior suite (hurray!) but that our room would only be ready at 14h00. No problem, left our luggage and went for a bite. Came back at 14h00 and waited for another 45min at reception for our room. Staff at reception looks clueless. Finally they said we would be moved temporarily to a standard room until our suite would be ready. We went for a swim, checked back at 16h00 but then it became ""somewhere tonight"". So we left and came back at 21h00 when we could move into our suite.

It's not that we were so keen on having a suite, but this just kept us busy the whole day! One of the most important things in hotels is having your room ready upon arrival. We were not the only ones with the same problem - besides us a group of Australians were experiencing the same.

The suite itself then: very nice, spacious, clean design, orchids, a bath and a shower, a kingsize bed, a living room, two televisions .... the lot! Such a shame that a stingy smell came out of the toilet. The sewer in this hotel must have some problems, because we also smelled it in the elevator.

Both swimming pools are nice, but sometimes crowded and a lot of security hanging around, also in the rest of the hotel. Makes you feel a little uncomfortable at times. They check your bags at the entrance every time you come back from the beach.

Breakfast was good, very typical business-hotel with eggs, toast, pancakes, noodles. Nothing negative about it.

Summarizing, we paid 399 USD for three nights, which was expensive for Bali. For that price you should be able to find better on a less noisy street.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2327,OK,30,August 2010,"We booked in for a week in the Hotel to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We were inadvertently, booked into a twin room with single beds which they could not upgrade at all so we spent the whole week in single beds! The Hotel is beautiful and clean and the staff were friendly however it was noisy as the lobby area is open and the noise carries to the close rooms. It seems like the hotel can't quite decide whether to market to the young generation as they had bikini night and bbq night near the pool but these were not well received. The food was average buffet food both at breakfast and dinner. BBQ must mean something else in Bali because it was again buffet food.I found Seminyak a great place to stay and the Haven was a good place to watch the world go by when you needed some respite from the hustle and bustle. As my title suggests the stay was OK but I am sure there are many other hotels that would be a better.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2328,Nice facilities but watch out for the scams,30,August 2010,Nice facilities but beware if you get the 'lucky doorprize' that upgrades you to a suite and then you have to move rooms (or pay more) the next day - very inconvenient. Staff are friendly but generally hopeless - never know an answer to a question. We also were pretty cross when our bill had charges for phone calls that we didn't make.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2329,"very nice hotel, accomodating staff",50,August 2010,"stayed there from Aug 19 - 23. Very nice hotel. One of our rooms was upgraded to 1 bedroom suite :) Staff are very accomodating and would always say hi / hello. Tried their BBQ Party buffet which is worth our money. Their Spa also offers 50% off every afternoon..Breakfast, though are the same everyday and guests can only use the pool until 8AM. Hope they can extend it to guests who would like to have night swimming :)",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2330,great location,40,August 2010,"I stayed at the hotel part of the Haven. It is a nice hotel and the best part of the Haven is the location, it is right in the heart of the shopping strip so makes it easy to wander out . The rooms are nice, spacious and well appointed. The staff are lovely, very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast buffet is OK, I've had better, but for the price it is more than adequate. If you are travelling solo this is a good hotel as the location means it is easy to go in and out and you don't have to take taxis all the time.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2331,Paradise in Asia,50,August 2010,"Being our first ever trip to Bali we were nervous of what to expect with all the reviews placed on Trip Advisor about The Haven Hotel. So we came with an opened mind instead. Having travelled all around the world, I would have to say the location of the Hotel was excellent. We had all the best places to shop at Seminyak bali basicall right at our door step. The staff at the Hotel has been some of the best polite and well mannered staff I have ever come across. They made our holiday just that extra bit special. The restautrant staff at the Sabeen hotel restaurant was great each morning at breakfast. The front desk staff were also fantastic and went out of their way for you each time. if only I could remember each of the staff members names who made our trip wonderful at this hotel. The beach staff was great when using the beach hotel facilities and the beach (thank you guys!!). The hotel has a free bus shuttle service to the beach, or you could walk down which is only a few minutes, hire a surf board and have fun in the sun, I am already planning our next trip back to Bali with friends and family, which we will definately all stay at the Haven Hotel again. To the front desk member Luthfi (apologies if I spelt your name wrong) thank you for your friendly helpful service. THANK YOU TO ALL THE HAVEN STAFF..

2332,In one word... WOW!!,40,August 2010,"We stayed 4 nights in a suite of the haven in Seminyak. We loved the place. It was clean, friendly staff, good breakfast and a relaxing pool to spend some time reading and swimming. The gym is small but the material is all new.
We first booked 3 nights on booking.com (good rate)and even with that booking we were upgraded to a suite. After 3 very relaxing days we wanted to stay a day longer and we good stay in the suite for the same rate. That was WOW!
So... go there, eat at the Thai restaurant Lemongrass and at the Indian Queen tandoor in Seminyak and you will have a great stay!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2333,Terrific place with attentive and caring staff! Its my home away from home in Bali!,50,May 2010,I stayed at the Haven in early May 2010. The staff were very attentive and helped me out a great deal. I had injured my foot earlier and the staff took care of me like I was at my own home. The hotel was very clean and wel maintained and central to everything. It was truly a relaxing environment. Vicky in guest services even realized it was my birthday and brought me a cake! What remarkable attention to detail and service. This is a great place to stay whether you want to just relax by the pool or go out an enjoy all the adventures and nightlife Bali has to offer.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2334,Home away from Home,50,August 2010,"My husband & I just spent 10 days (August 2010) in a Haven Suite. It helped us keep our sanity during our stay in Bali. Clean, spacious, had everything we needed. Our every wish was catered for by the staff, they couldn't do enough for us. We bonded with them and they became our family while in Bali. The pools were a welcome relief from the heat & humidity. Breakfast was great. The Haven Suites are a home away from home. Well worth booking and paying a little extra. Loved it........",The Haven Bali Seminyak

2336,Good place to stay,40,August 2010,"The Haven is a good place to stay in Seminyak. Close to shops, cafes and a short walk to Legian beach. We received a free upgrade to a suite on arrival. The staff are friendly and helpful. The Hotel is modern and fairly new. The rooms are stylish and very clean. The grounds are well kept. The breakfast areas can be a little crowded. The only issue I have is the hotel makes you pay for any breakages, so be careful with the cups. We stayed at the Haven for a week and would stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2337,The Haven is trully heaven,40,June 2010,"The hotel is located in the beginning of Seminyak area. Hip area of Bali, less crowded than Kuta. There were 2 entry gates. The taxi that drove us from the airport, dropped us at the back gate, the rather quiet one. Ms Rini from receptionist checked us in and surprised us by telling we’re getting an upgrade to suites room!!!
Oh my… Suites room is like a huge apartment with one bedroom. There’s a kitchen with complete appliances, that include a 2-door big refrigerator, stove, plates, etc. There’s living room with giant LCD TV that separated from the bed room with a balcony with the view to the pool.
The bath room amenities are soo nice, with the scent of green tea (soap, body gel, body lotion). Love them! The “wall” that seperated the bed room and the bathroom is made from frosted glass, so you kinda see shadow of what is going on inside =)
The king size bed in the bedroom (that has another giant LCD TV) is very nice and comfy, there’s also another balcony with a bed (!) also the view to the pool..double nice!!
There’s 2 pools in the hotel. 1 in the suites area, 1 in the hotel area. Mostly full from 11 am – 4 pm. At the time, the hotel held a pool party. How cool is that.
The hotel provide dropped off car to the beach. Provide us with the towel card to be exchange with towel (obviously) to the staff there, also with the beach bed special for the hotel's guests
My husband and i truly had a blast honeymoon there",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2338,Great location and service,40,August 2010,"Just got home from a 7 night stay at The Haven in Seminyak. The hotel is located on Seminyak Road close to shops and restaurants. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was very spacious and well layed out. There is a large day bed on the balcony which is perfect for an afternoon nap. There are 2 reception areas so make sure you go to the right one. The reception on the main road is for hotel guests and there is a seperate reception at the rear of the property for the villas and suites. Taxi drivers are familiar with the layout.

People have complained about the breakfast but we found it to fine with a reasonable selection of hot and cold items. Most of the sunbeds around the pool are in the shade for the majority of the day but we always managed to secure one. The staff were very friendly and efficient and always willing to help. There are 2 cheap massage places at the rear of the Suites with a 1 hour massage costing 60,000RP or $7.50 AUD. They are a great alternative to the more expensive spas in the area.

We had a great time at the Haven and would recommend it for groups or couples.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2339,B-I-G hotel - close to the hub of Seminyak,30,August 2010,"The Haven is a HUGE hotel with a zillion rooms on four floors plus villa’s and suites. The bathroom was HILARIOUS because it is a glass sliding door and wall that is only frosted three-quarters. You wouldn’t want to be shy with your partner! Rooms were never cleaned until late afternoon but the staff really tried hard to be of service without being obsequious. High speed internet was the fastest, it felt, in the whole of Bali (and some of Aus!!). A short walk to the restaurants, warungs and Bintang supermarket and 10minute walk to the beach although a shuttle service was available. The chairs around the pool were “reserved” from like 8am even though the “reserves” sometimes wouldn’t front-up until lunch-time. VERY CHEEKY!!! Beautiful lap-pool and lovely, clean fluffy towels. There was an abundant choice of breakfast dishes from cereal and fruit to different types of eggs, and Western and Asian food. Lots of spa/massage places all within spitting distance! We discovered The Sand Pit - a beach bar which had opened up two days before we left and run by two young very hard-working guys. Cocktails were 50,000RUP which was a reasonable price and a good serve with plent to choose from on the menu - also at reasonable prices that INCLUDED tax!!! Very nice to sit and sup and watch the sun go down while the locals played soccer :) Also Cafe Marzano on Double 6 which had THE BEST pizza and Warung Asia for Massaman Beef Curry.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2340,would come back asap for all i can eat BreakFast YUuuMMM!!!!,50,August 2010,"The hotel was lovely with very friendly helpful people, every thing was neat and tidy housekeeping was great, THE BUFFET BREAKFAST WAS AwesOMe !!!! i looked forward to it every morning ,We had a Great time with one of the hotel drivers ""Wombie"" who was very helpful and friendly to show us all around Bali.TWO BIG THUMBS UP TO THE HAVEN ,SEMINYAK HOTEL!!! I'll be seeing them again soon.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2341,dissapointing stay,30,,"I stayed at the haven with my mother and it was dissapointing to say the least. We stayed in the suites that cost us $2000 and the room only had bintang and coke in the fridge and there was an outside bed that I would have loved to sit on but there's was no mattress on it and having a look around the other rooms did???.
The service and staff were great except for when I called room service one night and got put on hold 7 times and talked to 7-8 different people because they could not understand what I was saying. As far as getting any sun or a tan goes the pool area is so shaded that only 2-3 seats get sun. Other than those few things it was fairly good but I've stayed in better.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2342,"Rates now increased massively, dont bother. Also good luck trying to get a response via email.",20,December 2009,"I have stayed at ths Hotel twice in the past year. Both times in the suites. The first time we stayed there was a bit of construction going on but the room was so nice and we got it for a good rate so we disregarded the construction as much as possible. The second time we stayed our air conditioning wasn't working properly almost the entire stay of 13 nights but the rate was good, so again we didnt mind too much. The past week I have been trying to email The Haven hotel to make a booking and they have only just got back to me today, after 4 emails and a week of waiting, only to inform me that they can not give me the same rate as we had the previous times we stayed. They now want DOUBLE what we paid. They dont really look after their exisiting customers very well.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2343,The best place to be !,50,July 2010,"We stayed in the suites for 4 nights . We were so happy with everything. The location is great, the rooms are great , the staff so friendly, the room service excellent, the hotel design is contemporary....All good ! There are also a lot of activities on the other side of the hotel ( deluxe rooms ) every day !

I would definetely recommend this hotel and will definitely go back !

2344,Great Hotel,50,August 2010,"Great Hotel with excellent service. We find this hotel are among the best hotel in seminyak. Not far away from the seminyak beach and the environment are also the best place for relax.
You can also have choice whether you want to stay in hotel, suite or villa.
Cleanliness are good, and the price also reasonable.
Among the best valuable hotel you can get in seminyak area",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2345,Amazing stay,50,July 2010,"Upon checked in, we were informed that our room has been upgraded to suite. We were treated with welcoming drink and cold towel while waiting for my room key. The hotel workers are very friendly and helpful since travelling with 3 small kids quite tough job considering that we had to bring a lot of things . The hotel surrounding are clean and this is important and also privacy.
The room is huge and very comfortable.
During my trip around Bali, my sons did asked us to go back to hotel in order for them to have their leisure time at the pool and room.
So it was great experience.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2346,clean friendly and comfortable,30,October 2009,"When looking up the the hotel on the internet it is very confusing there is two parts to this hotel the suites and the hotel part these are back to back to each other, the hotel part that we stayed in was only finished in october last year it was new and fresh. Staff were very friendly and helpful the pool was full lenght with only a small section in the shade. The food was great, security excellent. The only downfall was the restaurant was close to the road so we sat at the back problem solved. The hotel is not very baliness style more boutique",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2347,A great getaway hotel for a week,40,July 2010,"The Haven is a very friendly hotel in a convenient location in Seminyak. The rooms were clean, quiet, modern, and ours overlooked one of the pools. The staff are efficient and want to make your stay as lovely as possible. The free 30minutes of internet a day is great if you need to make plans and keep in contact with people. The gym has everything you need and really good new equipment. The security staff are wonderful and stop the traffic just so you can cross the road, and the room has a safe to lock your valuables up. Free drinking water in the room is replaced daily and rooms serviced daily with fresh towels. The breakfast caters for all with a wide range of fruit, rice, noodles, cereal, eggs, pastries, bread and other hot foods. Live music on a friday night in the bar/restaurant is a lovely way to end your holiday, chilling by the pool with a cold drink.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2348,Complete value for money,40,July 2010,"I stayed at The Haven for 10 days. I discovered this hotel has only been open for about one year. In my opinion and through speaking with others it would appear hotel management have listened to their clients and ironed out any teething problems they had in their first year of trading.
Positives: Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and modern. Breakfast adequate and catered for all (I know many past reviews stated breakfast didn't cater for western visitors, this appears to have now been rectified).
Negatives: Not much room around pool for sunbeds (Not a lot can be done to rectify this). We travelled with another couple and fully enjoyed our stay at The Haven and would choose to stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2349,Loved this Place!,50,July 2010,"Stay at the Haven Hotel this July with my partner we overall we a great time!! We had arranged to be pick up my the hotel and we greeted at the airport by a feeling friendly and funny young man , who also had bottles of water and cool towels after 2 long hot hours in customs this was magic! Check in was simple and a management type man showed us around and informed us on the features and locations on aspects of the hotel which was nice as this was our first time to Bali.
During our stay it was my birthday and whilst out for dinner room service had tried to deliver a birthday cake from the hotel , once returning to the hotel this was bought up with warm greetings from 2 staff members, very nice touch considering I had not mentioned that it was by birthday.
I could not complain about anything at this Hotel staff were super friendly and helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2350,Not up to our expectations......,20,June 2010,"Stayed in the hotel part of The Haven for 3 nights after booking on Latestays. After a 3 week holiday in Bali where we stayed in 6 different places this hotel was the biggest let down. For all the modern features and designer looks this place has no soul.
Great location with everything you need close by and not far from beach. All new hotel and nice modern rooms-although we could not locate the sound system in our room anywhere as advertised on their web site. You could be in a hotel anywhere in the world-nothing ""Bali"" about it and very little in the way of gardens. Its a big long narrow place that obviously has a load of money behind it. Far more rooms than the facilities that were available could cope with-about a dozen sun chairs by the pool in a 96 room hotel being a good example!
Staff were nice and friendly but they seem to be struggling with a lack of organisation and poor systems-management fault? This place has been established long enough to sort these things out. Small details like the background music at breakfast being on an endless repetitive loop and way too loud annoyed us.
Breakfast was ok-not a lot of variety-but could easily fall into a shambles. They could also do more to seperate smokers and non smokers. The bar and restaurant area is quite small for the size of the place.The one evening meal we had there was overpriced, tasteless and disappointing-the still half frozen dessert straight from the plastic wrapper was rubbish-no wonder we were the only ones eating there! And do not eat at the Jaya pub across the road-it was even worse! Try the eating strip down on the beach at the end of Jl double 6-much better value and food.
Checking in and out was confusing-we asked for a double bed when booking only to be told there was none available[in a hotel with 96 rooms that wasnt even half full?].
We were overcharged for our room and had to arrange a refund when we got home. Thankfully this issue was handled quickly and efficiently by the hotel.
Overall we were dissappointed and we would not recommend this hotel.
The suites and villa's looked nice but very expensive.
Try a smaller Balinese boutique hotel-much better service, atmosphere and value for money!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2351,Aptly named the Haven as it truly was,50,July 2010,The hotel made our stay in this busy vibrant location a real pleasure. The staff were very accomodating and helpful for all requests. The double suite we had was excellent for or family of four and we have never slept better. The pool areas were peaceful and refreshing. The gym was well equipped and easy to get access to. The Bintang supermarket close by was great for supplies and the money change opposite offered the best exchange rates we saw. ATM machines were also close by. Walking to the beach was easy and there were heaps of great restaurants 5 mins walk away,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2352,"Clean, new and friendly",40,July 2010,"The Haven was really a bargain find. We had a lovely stay and the rooms were lovely. There was a little snag trying to get a room with twin beds, but the staff sorted this out as soon as possible and were very apologetic. The staff doing the evening 'bed turn-down' service were so lovely and friendly.

The pools look really cool. The hotel has a very modern feel and lots of water, fresh colours and clean lines. There was very little noise despite being on quite a busy street. Breakfast was quite small, but there was definitely a nice selection. The location was great, on a busy shopping street and close to markets, grocery stores, money changers and many nice clothing stores. The walk to the beach and beachside restaurants wasn't too bad at all and in the day involved walking past lots of shops (which is never a bad thing).

I would not hesitate in staying here again and highly recommend to anyone wanting a reasonably priced Bali getaway. Good for singles. friends and families.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2353,Great place to stay in Seminyak!!,50,July 2010,"This hotel is great/ Everything is very modern and comfortable. The staff are very warm, friendly and helpful.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2354,Great value for money,50,June 2010,"The Good

Great value for money
Staff were the best Ive ever experienced in Bali
Free Wi-Fi
Huge beautiful rooms (ours was upgraded for free) my wife was so happy!
Small but modern comfortable hotel - very nice.

The Bad

Bit of a hike to the beach.
Pool wasn't great
Breakfast was nothing special
Wi-Fi didnt work well in room (but it was free)
(Keep in mind this wasn't an expensive hotel and the above is not a criticism, just mere observation)

Would absolutely recommend this hotel. Great value for money. If you're staying in Seminyak you should give this hotel serious consideration.

John",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2355,Good service in a Great location,50,May 2010,"We stayed 5 nights at The Haven and it is a relatively modern new hotel, not in a traditional Balinese style, but it is situated in a fantastic part of town – away from the crowds and frantic pace of Kuta and right in the middle of a quality shopping strip and close to a wide array of great restaurants, and not far from the beach. They also have a beachfront gazebo and deck chairs available for those who want to sunbake there.
Each day started with warm greetings from the friendly staff before enjoying a buffet breakfast. The breakfast could be improved by adding more healthy choices such as muesli (only available on request?), wider range of fruits and yoghurts, and providing multigrain bread for toast.
After each day’s activities of shopping, touring etc it was great to return to the tranquillity and coolness of the well-designed pool. The water features of the hotel enhance its elegance and pacifying design.
The Haven provided free internet access on desktop computers and was the only one of four hotels we stayed at in Bali to offer the use of a gym.
The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful; this showed from helping us to make local tour bookings and phone calls to sacrificing themselves during the tropical showers in order to keep us covered with umbrellas, which were conveniently located around the hotel at several locations. It was great theatre to watch the traffic controller/doorman as he stopped traffic to usher guests across the road and also to let taxis re-enter the constant traffic stream outside.
The hotel restaurant served quality tasty food and it was very entertaining to watch the parade of traffic and events through the open street frontage as you dined. The “hot biotic” drink made from honey, ginger, lemongrass and mint, became a favourite nightcap for our party of four.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2356,Just got back from The Haven,40,June 2010,"We stayed in a 1 Bed suite, hotel rooms very small and noisy, close to hotel bar and noisy road.
Must stay in the villas or suites, quieter and bigger
Staff are amazing can;t do enough for you at any time
Great location for those not wanting noisy Kuta, however we were disturbed at 3am by young people who looked out of place in the accommodation and quite frankly we were surprised to find groups of young people in this kind of accommodation. Pool lovely but very little sun for any sun worshippers. Breakfast good but don;t order boiled eggs unless you have half an hour to spare.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2357,Lovely Hotel,50,June 2010,On arrival at The Haven Seminyak and even though this trip a solo traveller I was upgraded to a junior suite – very roomy and lovely with lots of little extras. I found it a lovely clean and modern hotel with very pleasant staff the only two draw backs I found was that it was quite noisy being situated on busy JL Raya Seminyak and they need umbrellas at the pool. Other than that I was very happy and could certainly recommend this hotel.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2358,Fantastic location...,50,June 2010,"Stayed at the Haven for 9 nights. The complex is quite large. The hotel entrance is on Raya Seminyak, there is a restuarant at the front, with the reception area behind this, down the stairs is the pool area for the hotel, definateley a more social pool area than the suites. Further on from the hotel area is path that takes you through the Villas and past the day spa. The path leads to the suites area which is a U shaped building with the pool area in the middle. There are 3 pools here, a kids pool as well as two larger pools. They are in the shade for most of the day, this can be an issue for some people however for me I found this great, no need to cover myself in sunscreen before having a swim. The lounges by the pool were comfortable also, though at times there were not enough of these to go around. They have solved part of the issue of no pool bar by having a portable bar in both pool areas with basic soft drinks and Bintang available. The music playing was also great. With the pool surrounded by rooms I would not have wanted to be on the bottom floor, the place has 5 stories.
We travelled with friends, we had booked early and had a Haven Room, our friends had booked late and could only get a one bed apartment. We were dropped off at the Hotel side and thought we would be in different parts of the complex however they upgraded us to the suites as they had no rooms left in the Hotel section. We were taken to the check in area for the Suites, our friends had their one bed apartment, we were given a twin room which was the second bedroom of a 2 bed apartment with dual key access. The rooms were very clean and roomy, especially the one bed apartment. In room safes were available and there was enough storage room available. The living area of the apartment was HUGE! There was also a full sized fridge, the fridge in our room really was too small.
The bathrooms were lovely, the was frosted glass between the bedroom and the bathroom. Not sure if I would be comfortable sharing with a friend rather than my husband, not that you could see much. Our bathroom was great with a large shower area, our friends in the apartment was not quite as big and required them to step into a bath tub.
There were lifts at each end of the corridors which were fast and clean. However there are a number of stairs that need to be accessed to easily get around the property, this would make this property unsuitable for anyone with mobility issues.
We took advantage of the 50% off at the day spa for a massage. The surroundings were lovely however the music was a little loud. Not sure full price would be good value.
Laundry facilities were available however there were expensive, especially in comparison with the prices you can getn on the street. There was a laundry on Raya Seminyak about 100 metres towards Kuta.
The location is great, about 500 metres from the Bintang supermarket, close to a good chemist (Apotek) and there were a couple of convenience stores nearby also. Over the road was also a authorised money changer whon offered decent rates.
The hotel has a beach club, they offer transport down to Double Six beach where they have some chairs and umbrellas and will provide towels, the beach is patrolled.
Overall we had a great experience at the Haven, the staff were all awesome, the rooms were fantastic, the location is amazing. No kids club and there were limited children around. Personally I think this is a good thing, the place was quiet day and night, the breakfast was reasonable, the facilities were clean.
I would only recommend that the pool stayted open until 10pm rather than closing at 8 to allow an after dinner swim.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2359,Choose the villa and it won't dissappoint!!! heaven at the Haven,50,June 2010,"Ignore all the reviews if you are opting for a villa, We did and loved it! We now won't stay anywhere else in Bali, We go twice a year so have stayed at atleast 12 other resorts none as good as this!! The hotel is for the budget travellers hence the price and is situated along jl. seminyak so is good for a party trip, the suites a step up was highly recommended by our friends a young couple. We booked through AGODA and recieved a free night so ended up paying about $250 per night in the Villa. We thought it was worth every cent! Firstly it is massive with a private entrance and it's own 20 meter swimming pool (Approx) surrounded by large walls with decking, outdoor setting and daybeds. Japanese style sliding doors, live orchids thatched roof, slippers and robes. facilities included seperate kitchen with full sized fridge and cooktop. huge flat screen tv with cd and dvd. The bathroom had an inside and outside shower, the biggest bathtub I have ever seen!! The toilet lid lifts as you walk in and heats the seat ready for you then flushes automatically and closes the lid behind you. We were celebrating our first year anniversary and were suprised by a yummy cake. We ride a moped around bali and loved the underground parking for our bike the seat was never wet from rain nor scorching hot from the sun. The spa was friendly and tranquil with running water and soft music the only sounds you heard. We were given 50% off all of our treatments for some reason? Which was a very nice suprise! The only negetive we had was breakfast...it was ok. First morning we ate in the hotel dining area and ordered tea and coffee which never came and the selection of food was more of the savoury indonesian style breakfast kind. The next morning we opted for the suite dining area which had amazing service but still only average food. finally we opted for breakfast at KU-DE-TA which was amazingly yummy!! Ricotta hotcakes with honeycomb sauce and strawberries mmmmmmmm. We love the Haven so much that the breakfast was only minor we will be back for sure!!! Better service,More fruit, even a pancakes station and tastier eggs needed please:) Thank you for looking after us, the privacy of a Villa but with 24 hour room service and all the benefits of a hotel!!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2360,Lovely stay at The Haven,40,June 2010,"My husband and I stayed at The Haven in Seminyak for 8 nights. What a lovely place it is. We stayed in the Hotel rooms and were very impressed. Everything was very clean and the housekeeping staff were very obliging.
We had breakfast every morning in the hotel restaurant and once again the staff were amazing. Remembering our names and made inquires as to whether we were comfortable etc. It was a very nice touch and you felt like you had a connection with some of them. Although there was a large selection for the breakfast menu and food was very nice they did however not have so much selections for the Western visitors. As there appeared to be quite a few of us there staying a little more in western food would have been good.
The grounds were beautifully kept and the swimming pool was very nice and clean.
The Haven is well located and easy to find. It was an easy walk to the beach but if you so desired the Beach club would take you down in their shuttle bus.
All the staff were excellent and could not do enough for you. They were very polite and it was a pleasure to be there.
I would recommend this place to stay in Bali.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2361,great hotel exellent customer service,50,April 2010,my wife and I were very happy with all the hotel had to offer it was my wifes first trip overseas and she was concerned about quality and cleanliness but this hotel was above expetations beach service was excellent local restraunts were all very good meals the shopping was good got hounded on the beach but we expected that,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2362,Very Modern,40,June 2010,"Stayed last week for 10 nights. Very modern and new. Pool area dissappointment in relation to lounges and poolside ammenities. No toilet near Pool, needed to walk all way up through foyer to tolets. Not enough lounges for guests. Upside - they do have an allocated area at the Beach where you can get a lounge and towels. Breakfast very basic, but adequate. Rooms very modern and always well cleaned. If going away with friends, I would opt for a villa next time - and not necessarily at the Haven as they had suites which are more expensive. Plenty of Villas around and they work out much cheaper and more relaxing. Especially in Bali!! My friend whose wedidng I was there for stayed at Villa Coco. Amazing set up!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2363,Reassess PR,40,May 2010,"Hi There, Had a fantastic time at The Haven in April/ May 2010, but some hiccups that need rectifying. Please alter breakfast. As you are getting an increase in Western attendance, I would recommend adding additional things like yoghurts to your breakfast menu and more selection of fresh fruit, and cereals. The other thing was as we were staying in a family suite, I had a door fall on me in the bathroom and was stuck there for a considerable amount of time until my father could pull it off me. We were offerred an apology, and shifted rooms, but it could have been handled a little bit better I feel. We only had one staff member to move us and sharing with five people, we certainly could have done with more help, especially at midnight. The room we shifted to was ok, but appearred untidy compared to your normal standard, which is usually 3 + stars. It would have been nice and courteous to have been offerred a coffee/cake or meal complimentary as an apology. You certainly have a very nice hotel, and will stay there again, but a little bit of PR goes along way. We have recommended your suites/hotel to other people in Australia, and know of 4 other confirmed bookings. Your staff are wonderful and make people feel very welcomed. Please note I had also contacted your website to get information on your day spa, approximately 4 weeks before we were due to stay at the hotel. Just so that you are aware YOU are LOSING business, as of June I am still waiting for a reply.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2364,Lousy restaurant,20,May 2010,"This feedback is purely focusing on the restaurant as I did not stay in the hotel. I was with my wife when we decided to try out their buffer dinner.

Firstly, the choice of food was surprising limited,
- A small salad bar
- Plain Rice and Soup
- Baked potatos and Corns
- 2 choices of local cakes for dessert
- 1 choice of fish, beef, chicken, pork rib, satay (was told that there was, but it was never there)

Secondly, there's only one counter grilling these BBQ meat, the queuing will take 15 mins, and cooking another 15mins.

Thirdly, after waiting for 30 mins, the fish was not cooked and the pork ribs were cold when it was served to us.

Lastly, service was bad as the staff just took my plate, and re-cooked everything when I told them that the food was not cooked.

Not even an apology by the manager when I told him that this was the worst meal I had in bali for my whole trip.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2365,Great Hotel,50,May 2010,"Great hotel located along the main shopping street with easy access to restaurants and a less than 5 min walk to the Bintang supermarket. It's less than a year old so the hotel and room furnishings are still in good condition. The pools are great too. We booked a standard room but was given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite which was really beautifully designed. The suite had a big bathtub, separate shower and toilet. Bed was comfortable too. We had 2 flat screen TVs with ample cable channels to choose from.

The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. They remembered your name too. When we checked out, the staff helped us to get a taxi to the airport and reminded us to set aside enough money to cover the departure tax.

We took advantage of a promotion (50% discount on treatments during selected hours) to check out the spa services. Our massage was OK for the discounted price. Paying the full price would not have been worth it. During our treatment, the music being played was blastingly loud. We had to check the masseur to tone it down. The massage ended with a floral bath and whilst my husband and I were soaking in the tub in our birthday suits, the masseur came in without knocking to serve drinks! I would have preferred to have the drinks served after we have changed up.

The other minus point is the breakfast. The spread is simple but the food isn't great. This wasn't a major issue with us since good restaurants were within easy reach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2366,anyone who goes there will like this hotel,40,May 2010,"just been to bali for a month, did my homework on trip adviser ,great site Stayed at 5 different properties , The Haven being the 4th. The Haven is situated on the cusp of legian and seminyak so the position is great. Still near town and good restaurants but quiter and the shopping gets much better. The hotel itself has hotel rooms, villlas and condiminiums . I stayed in a hotel room. ,very modern,plazma, big bath, nice beds, new linen, couldnt fault it really and at the price on wotif great value. Breakfast was excellent, even had cheese which is expensive in bali. Loved the idea of its beach club nice sun loungers right on the beach The hotel is enviromentally friendly so all the corridors ,restaurants, reception etc are all open air,but very well planned for breezes.
But the air conditioning in the room kept playing up and changing temp and another minus was not enough sun lougers around the hotel room swimming pool In high season with the europeans it would be a nightmare. If you want a balinese type hotel this is not for you. All in all if you get a chance to stay there before the prices go up dont hesitate",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2367,Dirty but okay.,30,,"My partner and I stayed in the hotel section of The Haven; our driver dropped us off at the suites but the staff were lovely and accompanied us to the correct check-in. Our room faced concrete, which made for a louder stay, although our balcony was more private which was nice. My main complaint was the cleaniness of the room. Toenails, hair, and dead mosquitoes were throughout the room; upon enquiring we were told that rooms weren't cleaned, even between guests, unless the makeup sign was on the door. This may have been a problem with translation. We placed the sign up, and even after speaking to the cleaners the hair and toenails remained. Things like the basin weren't cleaned very well either.
Other than the dirty room, our stay was pleasant and the pool and restaurant were nice. I would say there's better hotels out there, but this one was good enough.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2368,Happy Honeymoon at the Haven,50,May 2010,"Thank you Thank you Thank you, to all the staff at the Haven. My new Husband and I booked our trip only 2 weeks prior to arriving with no previous knowledge of the resort and we were never disappointed. From the arrival to departure there was nothing we could fault during our 7 day stay.
On our first night our international call out was not working in our room, but when we approached the front desk, the lovely staff assisted straight away and put a call in for us from there. They rectified this small issue by the very next day and we could call out from our room.
I would like to acknowledge the standard of the Food and Beverage team of the lobby restaurant, we became almost part of the furniture there and the staff were absolutely outstanding, there attention to detail and their friendly and outgoing personalities will be something we remember about the Haven for many year. This is one of the main reasons we will return to the Hotel.
We stayed in a Hotel room and on arrival a beautiful rose bath was ready for us, a gorgeous chocolate and gift were in our room. Thank you for the special touches. The beds are some of the most comfortable I have slepted and the showers were always the right temperature.
The pool staff were always attentive and the Friday and Saturday night entertainment was an added bonus to the stay.
The resort is easy walking distance to everything and a great stay for those wishing to explore this area of Bali on foot.
Thank you for all your efforts from the front office staff, cleaners, Food and Beverage, security at the front and housekeeping, I recieved a hello from everystaff member as we past, this is a simple act that you all do so well. Keep up the great work and we will see you again later in the year.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2369,We had a wonderful stay at the Haven...,50,,"We had a wonderful stay at the Haven suites in Seminyak!

The staff were very friendly, professional and there was no request that went unattended to- excellent.

We had actually booked for the hotel but on arrival found we had been given a free upgrade to a suite. The suites are beautiful and worth the extra money spent- we will definately pay to stay in a suite again.

Breakfast is wonderful, the staff are very helpful if you have young children too. And I had the best massage ever at their spa.

Again, we will stay at the haven when we next return to Bali and I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my friends and family.

Thanks for a wonderful stay haven!

2370,"Excellent - location, price and design",50,May 2010,"The key to a good hotel in Bali is a mix of location and age. We must have read 50 reviews of different hotels and when we were there looked at 10. What you want to avoid is old hotels in the wrong location that are living off past glories. A 20 yeear old 5 star hotel is often in a area that is now seedy and the rooms will invariably be tired unless you score a recently upgraded room. So pick your location Seminyak is by far the best if you want upmarket. And the Haven is only 1 year old so you get a modern fitout. In summary it was dead quiet at night. Pool was modern and well designed. Food dont know who eats in hotels. Price on the money. Service excellent, our on line booking was stuffed up - seems to be a regular problem across all hotels in Bali - best to follow up a booking with a email, but it was all sorted once we got there. You wont find much better. The rear part of the hotel was where we were which is guarenteed to be very quiet. You wont be disappointed. But easy enought t rock up in Bali and just hunt around unless it is peak season.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2371,Customer service excellence,50,April 2010,"The friendly courteous staff stand out at this place - always willing to help and nothing is too much trouble. Even when there was some inconsistencies with mini bar - they handled it without fuss. My tip for future for any hotel - check the mini bar inventory before you start your stay not at the end!

Also very central location - close to Bintang supermarket and other shops.

Lovely landscaping and we got the one bedroom suite which was very spacious and and very comfortable bed & pillows - 2 tvs. There's even a day bed on the balcony. Very impressed.

Breakfast was also very good with omellette chef on hand. Filled us up nicely to last through the day.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2372,Great Boutique Hotel,40,April 2010,"A great boutique hotel located at classy Seminyak, excellent stay. Only thing lacking was the food.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2373,Poorly managed restaurant,30,February 2010,"Stayed there for a night, tried to get away from the office work for a couple of days. Aris the Front Office staff is very helpful and engaging very well. But the rest of the staff seems a little bit sleepy that night.
We stayed in the one of the suite, when I asked the bell man who took us to our room about how to switch off the balcony light he said is on timer, but the truth is there's a switch in the bed room, the hot water is not hot so we have to called the front office for the engineering to come and have a look. I asked the room service what kind of coffee that they are using but nobody seems to know.
The worst part is the breakfast, we did not went to the restaurant near by the lobby but we went to their extended restaurant below our suite.
Nobody there greet us since the restaurant is half full, dirty table everywhere, food in the buffet pretty much cold, we have to share a table with some other guests, and the build a side station to clear up their scraps from breakfast in the open, so guests who sit in the area can see everything that they are doing.
I believed they run the restaurant with trainee staff rather than their staff, so do not expect good level of service there.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2374,Huge comfortable suite!,40,April 2010,"We found The Haven to be fantastic! We stayed in the suites and had a 2 bedroom. Even with 2 kids we couldn't fill the space in the suite. Having a full size fridge was excellent with the kids. It also allowed us to buy big bottles of water and store them easily in the fridge.

As for the staff, they were extremely pleasant. Any problems we had (which we nothing to speak of) they were quickly onto it and it was sorted out. We have a daughter who still sleeps during the day and the house cleaning were very accommodating and would come back after her sleep to clean our room.

If you are looking for a place that has lots of social involvment , especially around the pool then the Haven isn't really your place. It doesn't have a pool bar or even a bar close by the pool. If you order a drink, they have to walk up a few steps and go to the bar area in the restaurant. Sorta takes away the feel of watching someone make your cocktail and I think also takes away the social attraction of people sitting around talking at a bar/pool.

The breakfast was good. Your normal Asian arrange of food plus some western food. It was a nice way to start the day.

Location was great. Plenty of boutique shops, stalls and restaurants around you.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2375,"Good Value, Good Location, Not as bad as some have said",40,March 2010,"We booked The Haven early this year on the advice of some friends. We had booked a 1 bedroom suite with a king size bed which was great value for what we paid.
We didnt look at TripAdvisor until after and some of the reviews really had us worried.
With our plane delayed and our arrival not until 11pm I assumed the worst. However, we were pleasantly surpised. We were greated warmly (with cold towels and a welcome drink) and shown to our room promptly which was clean, well set out and huge!
There are 3 parts the the hotel. The actual hotel which is at the front, some villas in the middle and at the back the suites. It is a very modern looking place so dont expect 'traditional' or a Bali look to it. The spa treatments were good and we spent a fair bit of time in the pool.

The Good :
Location in Seminyak
The Spa (had 50% treatments off at the time of our stay)
The Pools - There are 2 and both had ample sun
The Rooms - very comfy, modern
The staff - always saying hello and were prompt on requests
No construction noise - Its all finished
The Villas looked awesome
Modern, Fresh & Clean Hotel

The Bad:
The Breakfast was not inspiring, but hey, its breakfast. Eat out if need be.
The shower had poor water pressure but we think it was just our room.

The Ugly
Nothing at all !

Our experiences with The Haven were nothing but positive. All in all we had a great time staying there. I cant comment on some of the experiences of otheres here, but we didnt really encounter anything negative as stated in other reviews. We did travel at a quiet time of year which may have helped however we struggled to see or find aynthing from the other reviewers. Probably because we were too busy enjoying Bali !",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2376,"Great Service, excellent location",40,March 2010,"We have just come back from 8 nights staying at The Haven. All of the staff were very, very friendly and helpful. We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment which was clean, roomy, had all of the amenities we were looking for and had excellent air-conditioning! The only concern we had with the room is that the clothesline was very small and was over the toilet. Hanging up 1 wet tshirt nearly ended in disaster!!! So we gave that a miss from then on. We ate in the restuarant 1 night, which was OK but a bit pricey compared to many of the other great resturants in the area. Breakfast was OK, however they obviously struggle when most suites are full - need a couple of extra staff to cope. Could also do with a new toaster! However these are only small issues and we would definately come back and stay at The Haven again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2377,"New, Nice, Comfortable & Excellent Service",40,December 2009,"The Haven Hotel is 6 months new (at the time of writing). It is along Jalan Raya Seminyak. Should you like walking and enjoying mid - higher end shopping, staying at this location is strategic.

The rooms are comfortable along with Flatscreen TVs, glass shower area, etc. We had a room just outside the swimming pool. For travelers who wish to minimize any noise, we would recommend to ask for rooms on the higher floors (I reckon there are only 4 floors) or away from the pool.

The excellent service we received came from the fact that The Haven staff offered us a ""shower room"" to freshen up as we had already checked out, walked the streets and were really sweaty - when we returned for luggage & before the departure to the airport. This was excellent customer service indeed.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2378,Very unhelpful staff and scary experience!!!,10,December 2009,"We got very perfect trip in Bali until we got here... Front staff didn’t seem to try to help us in any way. Now we understand the previous negative review about Front and other staff there.

We booked this hotel via website when we were here and they asked to show the confirmation letter. Since we booked the hotel via website when we were there, so we haven’t got printer with us to print out the confirmation letter which we tried to explain to front staff but they insisted to request it and asked us to send them via email. What I didn’t understand was I asked if the website sent the confirmation letter and they said yes. They got my passport copy to identify that I was the one who booked it but what they said were it is policy. I asked them to identify myself by passport and credit card, they just ignored it. It took us quite long time to do the process until we got in the room.

But it wasn’t the most annoyed and scary part!!! We got the room back from our dinner around 7 pm. We asked for a bucket of ice from bar staff and he said there was no bucket here and asked us to asked from housekeeper. We did call housekeeper for it and the cost of it, he said he would ask to room service. Then, we waited more than 20 mins for the ice, SILENCE ALL NIGHT, no response or call from any staff!! So, my husband went to minimart to buy ice.

Not only that, we were in the room watching TV, one hotel staff OPENED OUR ROOM without knocking!!! when we asked him why… he only said he was sorry to get in the wrong room. At 8 pm sth., hotel staff accessed guest room at night without a reason and not even recheck the room number or knock the door!!! So that, we put the lock inside the room. After that around 20 mins passed, we heard a noise like someone tried to open our room but couldn’t then running sound. My husband opened the door and noone was there. We called reception regarding the events she said only to hang up Privacy signage on the door!!! ERRR, kidding me!! It kept me awaked and scared all night… We ended up with bad experience in Bali.

The room looked new but average and smell very bad. Breakfast is ok. location is good and close to beach but crowdy beach and not a good beach.

Not recommend this hotel to anyone at all especially one who travels by himself or girlfriens. Unprofessional and unhelpful staff…",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2379,BAD,10,November 2009,"Service was bad by staff, they over charged us. Charged us twice to credit card for our stay and calling to fix the issue was a nightmare as staff spoke bad english was hung up on and they had little understanding. Would not go back or recommend. Nice scenery but not cover bad service and bad taste left!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2380,Good contemporary hotel,40,November 2009,"We stayed here with some trepidation after reading some bad reviews about the hotel - but to be fair, they had been written whilst the hotel was still in construction stage. As of November, 2009 The Haven is almost completed and is in Soft Opening mode.

There are three sections to the hotel, consisting of a hotel block, a one and two bedroom suites block, and one and two bedroom villas. We stayed in the hotel and looked at the suites and villas. The suites would be ideal for families (they are intending to open a Kids Club), and the one bedroom villas would suit a honeymoon couple as they are luxurious and completely private, which each villa having its own private pool.

The rooms are quite big, beds are comfortable, the shower is fantastic - but they need show curtains or screens to stop water from flooding the floor (a process they have apparently begun). Each room and suite has balcony, but the hotel rooms do not have balcony furniture as yet. Internet is free, but you need a cable as it is only WiFi in common areas such as the lobby, and, this being Indonesia, the internet is slow.

Apart from the pools in the villas, the hotel had four public pools, three of which - one children'a and two adult pools are located in the suites area - the suites themselves are huge. The pool in the Hotel section is actually built under one of the hotel wings, so is in permanent shade, but I found this to be a great attribute as the sun burns quite fiercely, and by slipping under the building you can enjoy a swim without the sun burning you.

Breakfast was fine, they cater for both the Western and Asian diet. Staff were attentive and friendly at all times. If we had a problem. staff attended to it right away. The hotel has two entrances, the main one being on Jalan Raya Seminyak, right in the heart of the Seminyak shopping area. Despite this, the rooms seemed to shut out the street noise very well. It is just a five minute walk to Seminyak Beach.

My wife and I were very happy with our stay at The Haven, and we are sure that it will get even better once they have their official opening in early 2010.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2381,very nice clean quiet hotel staff very attentive,50,October 2009,"great hotel we stayed in a 2 bed room suit for 10 days. Was cleaned every day, ive read a lot of reviews about the water leeking over the bath, this happens, but if you dont have the presure of the water to high its better and you can all so tilt the shower head. The pool is great if you wish to sunbake do so in the morning as by afternoon shade is over the pool. We would definatly stay there again. Breakfasts very nice.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2382,Everything you need,50,November 2009,"We had a fabulous time at The Haven. If asked ""would i recommend it""? I would say ""definately"". We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was home to myself, my husband and 2 year old for 12 nights. The rooms are large and clean, though being self contained, they lack a few bits and pieces but really nothing too major. The staff are all very gracious and so helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them.
The place is surrounded by security so we felt very safe. The pools we thought were perfect temp and the 60cm deep kiddies pool was fantastic. The pool boasted lovely comfortable double and single sunbeds. reading some reviews on this great hotel i've come to the conclusion that some people are hard to please, but for us there is really nothing negative to say. So get your butts over there!! P.S The shopping around the hotel vaccinity is FANTASTIC!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2383,Good quality 4 star hotel but far from beach,40,November 2009,"The rooms in the new section were spotless and quite glam. The two pools in the complex are really nice, especially the new one with the big water feature coming down from reception. Reception staff were really nice and everyone was keen to iron out any glitches (the hotel is only just opened). Breakfast was pretty ordinary compared to some of the bigger hotels, with disinterested breakfast staff in the noisy front area right on JI Legian. Overall if it wasn't such a schlepp to the beach this would be great. If you're happy poolside then this would be fine bc it's very easy to get into all the clubs and bars from here.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

Cons.breakfast not variety,very slow wireless internet but free.

2385,"A bit overprice, very average",30,October 2009,"I stayed for 2 nights at the hotel with a friend and both of us agree that the price was a bit too expensive for such hotel. They charged us about IDR 950,000 (USD 100), while the gorgeous Sofitel Hotel (which was fully booked), not far from it, has its rooms at IDR 1,100,000 (USD 116). The Haven doesn't even have direct access to the beach, so I don't understand why they charge the room that expensive. However, location-wise is very strategic. We could walk to Double 6 area and it's only a mere minutes away to Kudeta, Hu'u Bar, or Living Room.

The hotel isn't fully completed yet. When we were at the pool we wanted to order some cocktails, only to hear that they do not serve alcohol (yet), only beer. I wanted to print my new ticket, only to be informed that The Business Centre isn't ready either. The restaurant service is poor, they don't even provide napkins and only gave me tissue when I asked, and left my dirty plates uncleared even though I was having another plate. The buffet was forgettable but edible.

The room is pretty standard but it's clean and the AC functioned perfectly. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. I didn't have a chance to try their free wi-fi service nor their spa offer.

Would I stay again in this hotel? Only if they lower their price around IDR 650,000-700,000. If they still charge almost IDR 1 million, I'd rather stay in Sofitel Hotel, definitely, immediately, in a heartbeat!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2386,Fantastic place,50,October 2009,"Don't know what people are complaining about. No sun at the pool area !! On the suite side of the hotel plenty of lovely sunshine. People get a life.
The buffet breakfast good and the coffee great. If you don't enjoy the breakfast then you can walk down the street and go some where on the beach strip, lots of restaurants.
The staff are very helpful and always willing to assist to give advice. My well travelled children couldn't stop speaking highly of the staff at the hotel. They think they are great and very lovely people and my partner & I agree with them. The security guards friendly and efficient.
The location is great just 5 mins walk to the Legian beach restaurant beach strip, some shops, but better shopping in Legian just 10 - 15mins walk away. . Highly recommend the Blue Ocean as a restaurant to eat at.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2387,The Haven Seminyak,50,September 2009,"Stayed in a suite last week, excellent Hotel, stylish, modern ,huge suites and fantastic valur. Read negative reports,can only say some people are harg to please.The staff were great,breakfast fantastic,pleanty of sun around pool, give it 9.5/10

2388,Do not stay at this hotel,20,September 2009,"Be warned this hotel does not live up to its web site claims. We booked a two bedroom full kichen suite for two weeks. The kichen had lots of cupboards which were completely empty,no toaster no microwave no pans not even a bottle opener,just 4 sets of plates and 4 sets of knives and forks and a kettle. House keeping could'nt provide any extras either. Breakfast was a shambles with a total of 8 small tables some in the entrance foyer.The 3 small pools had a total of 13 sun deck lounges that were non adjustable so you could only sit on and not lay on. Constant hammering and sawing from the basement sometimes until 2 am. Complaints were ignored. Moved to the outrigger after 5 days which saved our holiday. Do yourselfs a favour and stay at the outrigger which is far far superior especially if you have children. Also stayed at kuta townhouses for two weeks which was very good especially for children.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2389,Fabulous - great value - great staff - great location,50,September 2009,"My partner and I arrived late night Friday night (approx midnight) arrived and very easy check in. Was told no haven room available so upgraded to one bedroom suite on top floor with view over the beach in the morning. Couldn't complain about check in.

Was taken to our room and we were very impressed. All very new - great decor. Massive balcony with day bed and over looking ocean and pool. Beautiful king size bed - very comfortable and bathroom very big. Only downside was the big step into the bath - would be hard if you were a bit older and finding it harder to move about.

We ended up ordering room service at 3am that night - was to our room in about 15 mins - great service and very tasty.

We enjoyed the buffet breakfast - each morning. Good choice of food options and actual real coffee (lattes, capuccinos etc) available not just nescafe as lots of bali hotels have.

The staff were very friendly and helpful - no problems with communications.

My partner who had never been to bali before was very impressed with the hotel - and we couldn't believe the good value ($102 AUD) night compared with some other places I have stayed in Bali for same price.

Did not use the pool at all as ran out of time (only 4 days) but it looked beauitful, need a few more sun lounges but when new pool opens at the hotel think this will be solved.

I have no complaints at all about the hotel and would recommend it to my friends and family. IT is a great location - close to everything. Easy to get taxis and short walk to the beach and double six night area.

Find it really hard to imagine people could not enjoy their stay at the Haven. Loved it!! Would definately stay again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2390,Its good!,40,September 2009,"Nice rooms with rain shower.
But breakfast was not 5 star. But in saying that it is better than the 3 star that we stay in.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2391,Average Haven,30,September 2009,"As others have mentioned, location is quite good just 10 min to the beach and because of the hotel I discovered the other side of Seminyak. Everything else wasn't too bad just not memorable. We got a two bedroom suite, which was a one bedroom suite with a connecting hotel room, yes its huge and sofa's comfortable, TV had lots of channels but alas no dvd player. Wanted to catch up on random movies from was told that the player would be extra at 50k per day.

Obtained LAN cable for internet, but no connection from both bedrooms, so had to rely on weak wifi signal, but at least it was stable. Shower areas had no water problem as mentioned by others. Beds had furry throws which gave it a posh look.

Hotel compound is really small, and that's the disappointment. I was expecting at least more space to roam around, but the pool area was all to it, and with the tiny lobby/dining area, Haven should market themselves as a boutique resort. According to the website, suites come with digital audio systems, but there was none. Even the gym was offsite, at least 5 mins away, again misleading information.

Think I'd rather stay at tune hotel two streets down, which is currently on sale for just RM0.70 a night. They open in December.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2392,My God what a dump,10,July 2009,"We booked a one bedroom suite with twin beds arrived at Hotel to find we were to have a twin bed room “for same price!” as suites only have a queen bed…. After a long flight we were not happy. Ok forget booking we’ll find a new Hotel…we want to see the manager now! Oh sorry manger not available…..ok we’ll go to room, shower, rest and then as night falls have to find another hotel! Two hours later rang reception ….is manager available…..sorry no manger…..ok want to book out of room….but you have booking for 8 days! Yes for a suite not a room! We can give you two room suit but more money!....No just want to book out….oh ok we give you two bedroom suite same price. Pack up bags more too new room. But we had booked an honeymoon package which included flower bath on arrival …never happened!…….massage in room …..never happened!……diner in room for two never happened!. Swimming pool was in shade all day….Breakfast was a mess. Hotel already falling apart, what a dump! When we got back home found that the hotel had charged us two times…..lots of phone calls to get the money back. Would we stay here again, I would rather shoot myself",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2393,Frustratingly average... Everyday a new issue to deal with,20,August 2009,"I've lived in Jakarta 7 Years and myself and Indonesian partner have never had a bad experience in Bali... until now....

Day 1 : The Hotel got the flight details wrong so no car to meet us, we called and asked where it was and said we would take a taxi but they said the car is only 15 minutes away.... So an hour later the car finally shows up and it takes another 50 mins to get to the hotel. The driver chose to go via Kuta rather than take the highway to Seminyak which would take half the time.... Why ?? Then we find out that in the hotel computer the flight details were correct and it was an amatuer miscommunication... we asked that it should be free and after many hours they decided to give us $5 off the $15 dollar trip....

Checkin... OK, walk in the room and its big but poorly finished for such a new hotel and the shower has something dripping on the floor.... hmmm.... whats this....

Day 2.... Wake up to our first morning in Bali and confronted by some water bourne maggot type bugs surrounding the bath tub / shower.... So the leak in the roof starts to make sense.... So then we have a shower and water goes everywhere in the bathroom, so no wonder the room above is leaking.... Then we go into the bed room and the roof is dripping into our suit case..... After looking up at the roof we discover that its all black and obviously a long time problem and they have stuck us in a room that they know is leaking water..... So back and forwards with them and maybe we can move rooms.....

Breakfast.... Very busy and a lack of seating for guests.... the guests are even sitting in reception and the waiting area eating breakfast.... We managed a seat near the pool and had to ask 4 times for a cup of coffee which finally came after I had already finished a reasonably average breakfast..... A 2nd cup of coffee wasnt worth the wait....

Moving Rooms.... Finally they decide to move us..... another hour wasted packing and unpacking.... The new room is better but similar poor workmanship, cracked tiles, and flooded bathroom, the balconey door had a sensitive switch which you had to play around with to get the AC to switch back on.... The eletric supply seems really dodgy as everything you plug something in its starts cracking and popping.... the lights behind the bed gave us a disco show from time to time with all sorts of noises coming from same...

Lucky we are not spending too much time in the room....

Day 3 : Leave the room at 11 and come back at 5 hot and need a rest and shower.... the room is still dirty with water all over the bath room... even after leaving the please clean me sign on the door..... I guess 6 hours wasnt enough to make up the room.....

Your not allowed to hang towels on the balconey and they dont even give you something you can throw some bathers and towels over... the ""clothes line"" in the bathroom is tiny and positioned above the toilet so the couple of tiny things you can put on it will drip on your while using it plus face the risk of them falling into the toilet......

As avid swimmers we didnt even try the pool, small and dark and not inviting at all... a must in Bali due to the black sands and often dirty beaches.... Most days we couldnt wait to leave the hotel....

In short a poorly constructed hotel....not very well thought out and obviously poorly managed... the staff seem more concerned about trying to speak good english and putting on a show rather than taking care of business and the guests.

We wont be coming back and will be telling our network of friends to give the Haven a miss, there are plenty of hotels in Bali that have far more to offer than the Haven.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2394,Awesome Hotel!,50,July 2009,"Wow, we were not expecting what we got! The room is like a luxury suite, and the price is amazing! The location is superb, walk right down the road for 5 mins to the beach! Get the one room suite, unit 401 if you can! It's the best room on the top floor with a view of the beach and all over the area. Check out the photos I'm posting! The staff were all very professional, and the shower problem only leaks if you leave it on, just turn it off! I have to admit, the stone they used throughout the suite was never sealed, making it highly susceptible to stain retention. So, it looks as though it is may be dirty or smeared, when it is actually just stained from never being sealed. This isn't really a big deal, as it is otherwise extremely clean and the bed is amazingly comfortable! We didn't want to leave. Free high speed internet in the room too! Unlike Holiday Inn which charges you an arm and leg to use the internet. Stay here if you can!",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2395,"We would stay again, even with our dislikes.",40,July 2009,"We stayed in a 1-bed suite with a toddler.

MY RAVES:
Great if you're travelling with young children. We usually stay in a villa but thought it would be too unsafe with the pool being right on our doorstep with no gate. This way we still had lots of space and a kitchen area.

Excellent location.. close to the main street and restaurants/beaches.

Very comfortable bed with black out blinds!

MY DISLIKES:
The pool has no sun! It's always shaded and is freezing. So we spent alot of time at the beach nearby and we snuck into another hotel a few times which was a million times better.

The staff are way too young and experienced, especially for a hotel that's trying to give an exclusive image. They told us we'd get charged for not returning door keys & adaptors and couldn’t suggest where I could change a wet nappy after we had checked out, (they were so young they probably didn’t know what a nappy was). And when we checked in, we were charged IDR 300,000 daily to our credit card in case we did a ""runner"" - this was refunded when we checked out.

The furniture in the suites are already starting to fall apart, it will be interesting to see it in a years time.

The shower leaks everywhere!

Housekeeping not good – they did not wipe down the coffee table, dining table.. food still stuck there from the night before",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2396,"Good location but overpriced, poorly designed, poor client service",30,July 2009,"We are regular visitors to Bali, and often stay in Seminyak. This was our first stay at the Haven.

We stayed in one of the 2-bedroom places with our 3-year old daughter for a week, located on the top floor. The location off Jalan Double-Six is not bad, being a short walk to both the beach and shopping along Jalan Seminjak.

We noted during check-in that the developers are trying to sell apartments in the complex for about US$320k for a 1 bedroom suite, and US$460k for a 2 bedroom suite. More on that later.

We booked via Wotif, and check in was relatively painless although the hotel wanted a paper copy of the Wotif voucher. More on that later as well.

Rooms were clean, spacious and presented well, but then the glitches & eccentricities began to emerge. Broadband internet is provided free (which is a bonus) but it is only via LAN cable, not wireless unless you go to the lobby. The outlet is in the bedroom, not great for a quiet surf whilst a spouse or child sleeps! They also had almost no cables, suggesting during check in that guests should bring their own!

As mentioned by others, the shower in the main bathroom is a weird arrangement which leaks all over the floor. Hot water runs out after one long shower. The tap which switched the water from the shower to the bath outlet did not work, nor did the air conditioner in the master bedroom. The latter two issues were quickly fixed on request, but then we noted that the outlet which poured water into the bath was poorly located, barely getting water into the tub. Moving the outlet even slightly resulted in water flowing everywhere but into the tub. Sinks in the bathroom were also unpluggable.

There was no crockery in the otherwise well-laid out kitchenette.

The pools were nice, but spend most of the day in the shade, thus were actually quite cold during our dry-season visit. The hotel rooms all look inwards into the courtyard, which is OK for those of us staying at the top, but I could see this could be very irritating to those on the ground floor in terms of the noise as breakfast is served in that area. Why those at the top do not look outwards over the town and take advantage of the 4th floor view is anyone's guess. Perhaps planning rules prevent it.

Our real problems began when obtaining a babysitter. The hotel charge an outrageous rate three times the going rate for any other local babysitter, + 50,000 rp for a taxi home for the babysitter if the service goes after 8pm. Sounds reasonable until one discovers that what you get is the lowest-paid member of staff (ours was a cleaner) who obviously welcomes the overtime, but who speaks no English, and has her own motorcycle to get home anyway. Ours did not follow any instructions we gave her, and we were left with the distinct impression that if something bad had occurred, she would not have known what to do. Lacking any confidence in the hotel service, we ended up getting further babysitters outside the hotel (staff we knew at a local restaurant who spoke much better English).

Checkout was an irritating experience, with the front office manager insisting that we produce a hard copy of the Wotif voucher for our booking. We did not have a hard copy, but offered to email one (which we did), after being told we ""must do so before leaving the building"". OK, but surely guests forget these all the time and they can be obtained from Wotif by the Hotel? We were lucky we had copies stored on our laptop. The approach in this matter was rude.

As for the cost of buying into the development, all I can say is that the construction is already showing signs of problems. Loose & poorly fitting light fittings, the bathroom comments above, and signs of ""cheap"" fittings & workmanship would certainly warrant a very close look given the asking price.

I would consider this a last-resort place to stay in Seminjak.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2397,Great rooms pool in shade all day long,30,July 2009,these rooms were huge kitchen in the middle with kids room off to the side and our room off to the side . Bit of a problem if we all showered at once would run out of hot water had a trebblie smell in the master bathroom. Room service and pool service food wasnt very nice very overpriced for what you got. Great location could walk to the beach and the bintang supermarket just around the conner. Kids didnt enjoy the pool area in the shade all day son no laying in the sun have to go to the beach for that.,The Haven Bali Seminyak
2398,Better places to stay,20,July 2009,"This place looked great inititally but just did not cut it - I couldn't wait to get out of the place and think there are much nicer options in Bali and Seminyak to stay. I booked directly with the hotel and got an excellent rate which was good. However I did find the booking process VERY painful and I had to email 4 times to get confirmation (room type etc) of my booking - which even then I never recieved confimaration. I also sent my credit details and then emailed to ask if they had received them as I never heard any thing back to confirm only to find they had 'lost them' I had to ring to ensure they had a booking for me which was difficult as there was a real language barrier. (I travel alot in Asia and have not problem with lanuage but found the communication at this hotel really challenging). After many lengthy phone calls they then confirmed they had my credit details and 'a' booking. They actually still did not have this right (they gave me someone elses details and credit card number!!!) so I just took my chances as I was tired of the expensive international phone calls and emails that made no sense.

When I arrived at the hotel no one bothered to help me with my bags or suitcase up the stairs and I found the check in procedure very un welcoming and the staff quite simply confused. I finally got to my room - which was partly due to the kindness of Florence the guest relations manager (who was lovely - thank you Florence!). I had arrived at 1pm and was told I could not check in until 2pm and would have to wait. Thank fully once again Florence told the staff I could check in. The room was lovely and big - but the whole resort just lacked atmosphere. I felt like I could have been any where in the world not Bali). The 2 buildings are close together (5 large stories high - with about 25 m between them) I feel they have really exceeded acceptable heights. Because of this the pool gets little sun and is always freezing (even being so hot the pool was really, really cold and at times unswimmable). The distance between the ground floor rooms and the pool is about 10 m. There are maybe 7 deckchairs that get any sun throughout the day. The rest of the deck chairs - about 10 of them get no sun at all. Breakfast is really slow and they run out of tables. There are about 5 tables sheltered from the rain - the rest are outside so when it rains there really is no where to sit for breakfast. They also took to replacing deckchairs for breakfast tables which meant if you had a room on the ground floor you were woken by people eating breakfast directly (like 2 m) outside your room. They also left the table out all day - which meant the area that normally had 4 deckchairs and got sun where taken up by empty tables for the day. It also meant that if there were alot of people around the pool the hotel ran out of chairs etc.
The shower leaks EVERYWHERE and unlike the last review I had difficulty especially in the evenings when I rang to get the mess cleaned up. One night I slipped over and actually cut my leg, I rang reception and got a male guest relations manager who told me I would have to wait till tomorrow to get extra towels. I tried to explain I really needed help and after alot of taking finally got the house keeping there to help. They were fantastic and so sorry about the mess and worried that I had hurt myself. I found it upsetting and poor service that the guest relations made no effort to followup or see if I was ok following that fall which was caused by really bad design.
I found with the hotel is that becuase it is very narrow and it is 2 tall buildings so close together any sound really echos through the place and you can hear any thing. This was especailly so on a Sunday morning when a alearge group of peaople who had been out all night were continuing to party on their balcony from 7am - till about 9am. Of course this is not the hotels fault but they were so loud it would have been polite and thoughful to other people staying there if guest relations had perhaps asked them to move inside their room so the rest of the hotel didn't have to hear them. As I say this was made worse by the fact sound just carried through the whole place amking it quite unrelaxing.
Checking out was also painful as before I left Australia I gon out some American money to pay the hotel as they had quoted me in American $ and the hotel said it would be fine to pay my room charge in Americal money. This turned into a 25 minute argument as the boy on reception when I was checking out refused to take American money - I had got this money out especially and found it very frustrating that they told me they couldn't take it. I found it wierd at one point they tried to tell me it was counterfeit!?!!? I assured them it was from a bank in Australia and the cash was fine. They changed their tune quite suddenly and they took the American money and I was finally really glad to be getting out of there. All in all - yes this hotel looks lovely the rooms are big but it really lacks personal touches atmosphere and good customer service.

The hotel also lists on it's website that they have a fitness centre - which it hasn't. It has a spa - which is basically a service where for 30$ US plus tax and service charge they get a therapist to come to your room. Nothing special really. They are still building another part of the hotel and there was alot of banging and construction happening when I was there which you could hear when you were trying to relax by the pool. Overall not a nice place to stay would not stay there again.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
2399,Enjoyed it!,50,April 2009,"We stayed there while soft opening - so the price was vey good - 95 usd for a 1-bedroom suite! (including taxes). Overall a very good experience. The pool was big and empty - several times there were no people at all besides me! It's very relaxing. The rooms were brand new, well-equipped, clean. Although we had some problems with WC and with water running on the floor while taking a shower - it wasn't annoying because the staff reacted rather fast. Breakfast was a bit slow. It's OK if you are not in a hurry :). Room service is good - we liked the food. Wi-fi wasn't working at that time, but considering the price for the night, it's not a problem! For your information it's about 10 minutes' walk to the beach from the hotel. Also, there’s a very nice Greek restaurant Pantarei nearby and lots of shops.",The Haven Bali Seminyak

2401,"New, Sleek, Sexy, pity about the...",40,May 2009,"Rat. Yes a big one, BUT staff were great, came to investigate at 11pm at night. My partner and 2 kids stayed in a suite room of 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living/dining/kitchen and 3 balconies. There is a shallow pool, and it was cold all day long, as it is sheltered from the sun being in the middle of the suites. There are 2 deeper pools as well. Staff were all great, friendly and helpful. Suites were in ""soft opening"" so Im sure that they will work out any bumps, but overall a really nice relaxing place to stay. Great location just of Double Six Street, not far from beach.",The Haven Bali Seminyak
