0,Very enjoyable and relaxing stay at Bhavana Villas,50,March 2023,Fantastic villas with a fantastic pool and a lot of space to enjoy. Staff are very friendly and are very happy to assist where possible. We were even upgraded to a double villa which we were very appreciative of. Highly recommend.,Bhavana Private Villas
1,"The villa is large very secluded and private. ""Wonderful Balinese Staff""",50,February 2023,"The villa has a large garden area and very secluded and private. We really enjoy our time here, the bedroom and bathroom are massive with good airconditioning, the living area is open with natural fresh air. The Villa pool is very private and water is warm from the bali sunshine.

The location is perfect for us because is gives us a quiet enviroment but also close enough to walk the entertainment, restaurants and shopping streets which is just a 8-10 minute walk or 3 minutes in a taxi.

A choice of Alacarte breakfast is served and cooked in your villa every morning by the staff who are just wonderful. Thankyou to everyone at Bhavana who made our stay perfect",Bhavana Private Villas
2,"Good location, Seminyak Village Mall and entertainment within 550m from Bhvanna Villa",50,February 2023,"We enjoyed our wonderful stay at these villas in seminyak. Staff are very helpful and assit with anything we requested, even they will book a Grab taxi using their phones if you ask nicely.
Every night you can order your breakfast with them and they arrange staff to come cook in our villa the next morning at any time we choose.
The Villa pool is just perfect and private we have so much fun enjoy the morning sun on the pool. Locaton is 550m from semiyak village mall and takes about 8min to walk.
the bedroom has beautuful white netting that you can use if concerned about mosquito atvnight but we didnt have any problems at all, everything was great. Also Nirvana Bar with live band on Jl. Kayu Aya, Seminyak, is 550m from Bhavana Villa.",Bhavana Private Villas
3,Big Smiles from friendly staff,50,February 2023,Location is a 10 min walk to Seminyak Square & Seminyak Village mall. Villa is comfortable and very private. Breakfast is prepare daily in the villa by friendly balanise staff who speak good English. Villa pool is a good size at 3 x 9m and 1.6m deep. Water is always warm to swim. Traditional Balinese decor throughout and has comfortable feel. We would definitely stay again,Bhavana Private Villas
4,"100% Private, extremely satisfied, a place where stress doesnt exist",50,February 2023,"This is a excelent villa experience, totally private, villa has its own large private pool and open kitchen facilities.
Decor is 100% Balinese furnishing which really adds to the overall unique experience . Breakfast is served in your villa. Just request a time and staff will come and cook for you inside the villa with total privacy.
Bathroom has open rain showers again with total privacy. Beautiful gardens inside and outside the villa.
The feeling is so unique its like you are living in your own balinese home with all the modern facilities.
I saw many guest here from Australia and european countries. The water in the villa pool is also warm for a very late night or early morning swim. Staff here always smile and say hello every time you pass.",Bhavana Private Villas
5,Best hotel in town and good space for corporate meet,50,May 2022,We booked few rooms for our event was happening also at efcee and during the event services found excellent and food is also good and staff is very cooperative and helpful and location of hotel is on main highway. You will have good view from rooms and restaurant for victoria 23 . We had enjoyed the stay and services. Recommend to all and must stay and enjoy the services from efcee sarovar,Bhavana Private Villas
6,Very Disappointing,20,July 2021,"On paper Bhavana Villas looks great - it has a convenient location, and one and two-bedroom pool villas. It looks modern from the outside and first impressions aren't bad. But after a month here I can't wait to leave. While the staff are truly lovely, there is literally no management present. I'm a big believer in letting hotels fix problems while you're still checked in but I asked to see a manager three times and they never came (I don't think they even come to the property).

Subsequently, housekeeping standards are very lax, and the wear and tear of the hotel is very evident, from cracked tiles and pool stairs, to green pools filled with debris from the garden and the thatched roof, to bat and mouse droppings on the walls and through the kitchens, to kitchen cabinets that are falling apart, power lines that dangle above the outdoor shower, and years of grim that's accumulated on the inside one. The sheets are stained and tired, the wifi is incredibly slow (measured at 10MBps) and due to a lack of fogging, you can't spend much time outside your room at night due to the mosquitoes.

The staff told me that the management had made lots of cut backs and it was very evident - the international channels on the TV have been stopped, the ancient stereo in the villa is nothing more than ornamental, the kitchen tap was incredibly corroded (which they promptly replaced), the sun beds are in tatters, and the AC turns off on a regular basis. I ended up buying my own fan and cleaning supplies just to maintain the space.

I know things are hard at the moment and I know the staff try, but they're mainly trainees who wander around like zombies with a duster in their hands and when they leave, the paths are unswept, the pool still filthy, and the counters covered in what I can only hope is dust. Great location, nice and quiet, and lovely well-intentioned staff (especially Putri and Teddy) but needs some better management and some serious investment, especially as they are still trying to command market prices. This is my upteenth visit to Bali and plenty of other properties are getting it right.",Bhavana Private Villas
7,Holgate,10,February 2020,"Most disgussing filthiest place we
have ever stayed in Bali. 5 minute to clean room no rubbish bags for the bin floor got flooded because the drain was blocked had to wash the floor with disinfectant wipes
pool was green and full of mould could not swim. Left heaps of drinks ut not there brand so made us pay and kept the drinks anyway. Not worth the money it was a dump 50.00 per night would have been too much we paid 200.00 per night. Never again

.",Bhavana Private Villas
8,Relax and unwind,50,February 2020,What a way to chillax...wonderful staff very friendly and helpful ..close to everything you want to see and do..gr8 bars and restaurants at your doorstep...shop till ypu drop...or just relax and swim in your private pool till the early morning...,Bhavana Private Villas
9,Post-cruise treat,40,January 2020,"Our travel agent booked this hotel after we disembarked our cruise in Bali. We didn't know what to expect, never travelled to Indonesia before, but we were overwhelmed by the welcome from the staff here and the good people of Bali who were so friendly. By western standards, the Villa we were in was perhaps a little tired, but this is another world, and any minor imperfections were more than made up for by the service of the staff, the ambience and the private and exclusive experience we had. From the moment we checked in, Siska could not have been more helpful and friendly. We found the Balinese people mirrored her personality - what a pity it is so far from UK that we couldn't do it all over again! To have our breakfast prepared in our villa by charming and highly competant staff each morning was a real treat and to have a pool at the foot of our dining/sitting area was something we will never forget. Taxis are cheap but it's only a 15 minute walk to a wonderful beach.",Bhavana Private Villas
10,Private and exclusive,50,November 2019,"My wife and I visited this hotel for 4 nights during our honeymoon and we where pleasantly surprised. Very kind staff, including Siska at reception made us feel welcome. And the quality of food and private rooms with exclusive pools, meant a perfect chilled-out stay. Cheap taxi’s too the beach which is not dat away...highly recommended!",Bhavana Private Villas
11,Great location to stay,40,August 2019,"We stayed in a one bedroom villa with our own pool.
The villa had all the amenities we needed for a great holiday
Although the weather was a perfect 28 degrees every day the pool in our villa was too cold for swimming. The villas are in a great location and easy walk to everything.",Bhavana Private Villas
12,Best Villa for family,50,May 2019,Great experience for villa stay at very economical price. If you are with family dont forget to carry some games as its only you in the villa. So you need something for activities. Also the swimming pool is deep 5+ feet so you need to ensure carrying right accessories for kids to enjoy the pool.,Bhavana Private Villas
13,VERY DISAPOINTED!!!,10,May 2019,"I am writing to inform you that our stay at Bhavana was very disappointing.
The villas are very tired and run down badly due for a renovation.
There is broken furniture and lamps, the bed was hard and the sheets where discoloured.
The pool was dirty with debris from the roof. Also my friend was entering the pool from the step when it broke away from the edge she was lucky that she wasn't badly cut from the rough edge.
Pool umbrella had holes and also the pool lounge cushions.
Towels where dirty and thread bare and also not replaced or changed every day.
Cleanliness of the villa was very average.
The breakfast we only had once because it was very average and we where worried about the cleanliness of the plates, kitchen etc.
Every morning we woke up to Bat droppings in the kitchen, dining and lounge area
on the floor and over the furniture. DISCUSTING!!!!!
The one driver they had refused to drive us to the restaurant for dinner one night and told us to walk. The restaurant was not in walking distance. Not sure if he was the driver or Security.
The other issue that I think is a very big concern is that we paid for a late checkout before going to the airport they asked that they would only accept CASH not credit card.
They also charged for a bottle of water that we didn't have after we left them our unused alcohol.
I think this is a bit suspicious THAT THEY ASKED FOR CASH.",Bhavana Private Villas
14,Bali Getaway,40,May 2019,"Villa Bhavana is in a great location, close enough yet far enough out of the chaos. Staff are delightful and the setting so private and peaceful. A few things need attention which would make all the difference in the world. Cleaning needs to be improved, as we had to point out to the staff, attention to detail is not great, fresh water not always left and 1 towel left for 2 of us on more than one occasion, so a few things that are really frustrating but with a little attention would be a big leap.",Bhavana Private Villas
15,Great location,30,March 2019,"We’ve stayed at Bhavana Villas before. They have certainly done some maintenance since our last stay, which is great to see.

Unfortunately they’ve dropped the ball a little on service. Staff are lovely and friendly, but daily we had to ask housekeeping for items not replaced, such as removing towels or face cloths etc and not replacing them.

Bed was terrible. It was hard and caved in the middle. We had to put pillows between us so we didn’t keep rolling into each other.

Breakfast was just breakfast. Nothing outstanding. Disappointing the fruit juice included is actually powdered or a flavouring. It’s not fruit juice. If we were to stay again, we would not have breakfast included.

Pool was great size. A little dirty from debris from the thatch roof.

It’s a great location and good value for the discounted rate we had. Would I stay at the full rate no. Not worth the money. If you can get it at a discounted rate, definitely worth considering.",Bhavana Private Villas
16,Very nice villas,40,January 2019,"The villas themselves are really beautiful. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The bathroom's outside yet very minimal bugs and mozzies which we were simply amazed at. Large outdoor seating area in front of the pool which is a plus. There is lots of street noise so it's not the quietest villa. The main downside would be the breakfast and room service. We would get breakfast cooked for us in the villa yet the plates would not get cleared when the room gets cleaned. Instead, they would pile up for 3-4 days before getting cleared which made lots of wildlife hover around and nibble at the food which really wasn't pleasant. The room service arrived freezing on 2 occasions and it really wasn't very nice at all. But the villa itself is very spacious and comfortable.",Bhavana Private Villas
17,Our honeymoon trip was bad experience because of the Bhavana Villas,10,December 2018,"We did like :

1. pick-up and drop off from and to the airport. The driver was here on time.
2. The human side of some stuff.

We didn't like a lot of thinks :

1. During the check-in the stuff obliged us to pay right away. Although we've had a confirmation for an early check-in we had to wait for 1 hour to get our Villa ready. We've got to the Villa after a 10 hours flight so we were so exhausted

2. We were chocked by the cleanness of the Villa, the bed sheets were way to washed and cleaned but there too old and used 1000 times because they were no longer white but almost yellow. The furniture is way too old.

3. For breakfast, the utensils were not clean, so my wife lost appetite and she got sick for the first two days.

4. The massage kit was awful, a very old table that should be no longer used, a broken and old container for the massage's oil and other things.

5. There only one driver who is not available all the time during the day time, so if there is a high emergency you have to wait for the ambulance.

We can go over and over but I think these five are enough. When we saw the terrific condition of the Villa at the beginning we've asked for our money back and go to another one, they said NO we've already took the money and there is no refund. We've sat with the managers few days later, and they said no refund as well, they offered some free tours but we already had our tour guide booked outside the villa.",Bhavana Private Villas
18,"Lovely, quiet & private",40,October 2018,"We stayed here for 4 nights and had a lovely stay. Prior to arriving we read some negative reviews that made us nervous, but also helped us manage our expectations which we found was iimportant in bali. This is a 4 star villa, Here is a list of positive aspects and opportunities for Bhavana Villas:

Positives:
- lovely lovely staff
- very private and quiet
- beautiful gardened pathway to villa
- lovely pool that gets intermittent Sun which was perfect for us, we loved it
- absolutely gorgeous bathroom with huge shower + outdoor shower + bath and large vanity, complimentary water to brush your teeth
- traditional style villa with beautiful wood furniture
- comfy bed and lots of lovely pillows
- cleaned daily
- turn down service in the evening including extra mosquito coils and candles
- breakfast cooked daily was a nice touch

Opportunities
- the wooden and material blinds need fixing. Technically still work but despite this being mentioned in many reviews they have not fixed this yet
- there was only 1 pool bed instead of 2
- they work on a system where you leave your towels on the floor if you want them changed. On the 3rd day I wanted a fresh towel but they hung up my dirty towel instead of changing it
- our pool towels smelled by the end so they should change them every 2nd day regardless due to the constant humidity
- the sound system needs updating our phones didnt work on it
- I waited 1.5 hours for my room service which comes from a busy cafe 1km up the road so perhaps room service here isnt the best option, I should have just got the food myself instead of being lazy",Bhavana Private Villas
19,Will be back,50,October 2018,"Great time staying here, absolute luxury. Beautiful staff, lovely breakfast, pool villas amazing. We will definitely be back here. Central to all things in Seminyak and close to lots of cool restaurants and bars",Bhavana Private Villas
20,Disappointed,30,September 2018,"Like the previous review I contemplated to put up a review or not. I let the ""little "" things go however the little things just kept happening to the extent that reflected resentment. I booked the villa a few days before travel and ""picked"" up a deal so I was led to believe @ $ 200 per night room only.

On arrival nice greeting but waited an hour, we asked what the hold up was on our room to be informed the room wasnt ready as the current occupants had been held up with a minor traffic accident - they were ok just running late - these things happen.

We informed staff the DVD and CD player outside was not working, we had hoped to listen to our music we bought (oldie stuff not the doof doof the younger generation listen to ) whilst having a quiet drink around the pool and the DVD player in the room had no remote. They suggested moving the player from the room outside to listen to music then move back in to the room for DVD hence hubby couldn't listen to his music in the pool if I chose to relax inside with a chick flick.

We have stayed in 5 different villas over the years in this area and this happened before in another villa the staff went out of their way to find a replacement player which I suppose I expected this time?

I too accidentally broke a glass which I signed for the cost of $5 to replace (I note another review had to pay $10 ) even asking for another glass daily (I prefer tall glasses to drink from ) this was not replaced.

On the third day the pool was very low on water way below the skimmer box consequently the water jets struggled becoming very loud and the wonderful large water feature stopped flowing. We asked for a top up to be told maybe tomorrow as they were working on the plumming, that must have been the reason for that very loud bore drilling and workman out the front all week and little or no pressure for morning shower.

Had to also like others ask for towels at least one each every other day.

Two nescafe satchels a day we asked daily for another one.

The toliet was not secure and wobbled and every time I used it I felt unsafe. Tap fitting and shower head loose. Hot water ran out quarter fill bath.

Ok I hear you say ""get a grip and stop being precious"". I agree however its the ""little things"" that make a well deserved break worthwhile.

I offer constructive comments as to improve these once wonderful villa's and this is what I believe the correct forum.",Bhavana Private Villas
21,The Truth,30,February 2018,"I have been contemplating whether to write this review but if you are reading this then like myself you come searching trip advisor before booking your next holiday. This is just my honest experience. I booked a two bedroom villa at Bhavana for 5 nights in Feb this year. We arrived at the airport and our transfer was not there to pick us up. After contacting the hotel more than 3 times, over an hour later someone came to pick us up. (not so bad). When we arrived at the Villa we were welcomed by lovely staff although the villa itself was pretty run down. The blinds were broken, bath tub cracked etc. During our stay the bathroom was not properly cleaned once. Just mopped (slippery tiles). This is when my sister accidentally knocked a glass over as she slipped (on the slippery wet mopped tiles). We did not think anything of it until it came to check out. The staff had kept the glass pieces in a plastic bag and then charged us $10 Australian to replace it. (We had called to say it was an accident to clean it up). Considering the amount of money we had paid to stay here we were quiet shocked. Breakfast at the Villa was not nice at all. My sister got food poisoning from the meat (she had not eaten anything else) and spent the day vomiting. The towels were never changed even after asking the staff we were given only one towel between us. The pool was large and got lovely morning sun. The bed was quite comfortable and we loved having our own bedrooms and our own bathrooms. I wouldn't recommend staying here more than 2 nights as there are much nicer places to stay (especially for the price).",Bhavana Private Villas
22,Lovely comfortable villa,40,September 2018,"We’ve been staying here for the past week with still 3 more nights to go. I’m seeing lots of negative reviews here. I’m not sure why. Maybe people’s expectations are way too high. The villas are lovely. They are clean and tidied every day. There is also the evening turndown service with mozzie control. There is no problem for new towels, sheets or anything really. The staff are friendly and more than happy to see to any requests. Breakfast is adequate for a complimentary every morning. You just fill out your request at reception the night before. Our pool is maintained and extra candles have been brought in for a wee bit more lighting but it is adequate anyway.
This is not a 5star hotel. It’s a villa!! We are not in Europe, it’s Bali!!! It’s a simpler way of life with not all the mod cons of home.
I do agree however with the taps. Shower head and taps definitely need to be replaced and maybe an upgrade of blinds wouldn’t go astray either. For the price it’s well worth it. That’s the only gripe I have really.",Bhavana Private Villas
23,Not clean at all,20,August 2018,"We just had a three-night stay at Bhavana Villas. The villas had many benefits - nice location, plenty of space, friendly staff - BUT everything dissapears when there is no cleanness. The pool and the surrounded area was full of bat droppings which we had to ask to clean every day. Pool couldn't be used due to dirty water. Our breakfast was served at the room and they didn't even clean the table from the bat droppings. The plates and forks were not washed properly. We stayed 3 nights and they didn't change neither the towels nor the bedsheets despite the fact we asked them to do it. Extremely expensive for such unclean place.",Bhavana Private Villas
24,Disappointed,20,June 2018,"I'm writing in to say how excited my partner and I were when we saved up for a 12 night holiday to Bali . We had a fantastic flight with Garuda a great tranfer to the Bhavana private villas by Buffalo Tours then things started on a down hill slide as we saw the condition of villa number 4 . I don't know where to start but here i go. This villa needs alot of work starting with replacing the venetian blinds other and blinds that were broken , the dvd was missing , down light globe's not working , lamp shades falling apart , the big old bed falls to the middle so we had to put a pillow between us , had a nice big bath used it but couldn't get rid of the water as the plug was broken and later repaired after I brought it to there attention , the bathroom sink tap had water sprayed out everywhere except in the sink when it was used, very hard to get the used towells and bed sheets exchanged for some reason plus there was no face washers and tea towels and just a very old sponge to wipe things down with .To book breakfast you had to fill in a form and after the first morning we happen to loose our pen so i asked if I could have one the reception response was they didnt have any spare ones and we didnt even get one in the room when we first arrived , but low and behold our pen turn up the next morning at the front desk as it had my partners name on it and im not blaming the staff just the management not having one for the room when we first arrived and spares for themselves . We had only 1 bathrobe in the wardrobe didnt ask for another one , had to remind staff to top up the coffee, sugar , tea container .The private pool was ok but again needs an upgrade as there was a broken paver and i had to ask for chlorine as it started to go green . Our whole holiday here just seemed like hard work trying to get things we paid for . The disappointing issue here is we paid top dollar for this accomdation with no benefits which you normally get at resorts, The Haven was fully booked so we were recommended this place by a travel agent so i looked up the glossy review on their web site and it looked great but maybe the photos were taken ages ago . The staff were helpful and friendly but as soon as you asked for something it looked like the made out they couldn't understand . I couldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they looked at bettering the issues i had and lowering the price and added little extras and upgrading at least villa 4 that we saw . To sum it all up its just a very run down over priced villa . P.s just to top things off after checking out i left behind a small bottle of Smirnoff and some scotch which I thought they might like and reception had the nerve enough to ask for money for a crappy old glass which was accidentally broken by my partner . I cant beleive after all the tipping and my partner giving away a dress and a top to management they had a nerve to ask for money. Once they saw I was annoyed they ask me if I can write down on a piece of paper explaining it was an accident again couldnt beleive what i was hearing so eventually they said because we were booked there for a lengthy term not to worry about it . Please look around before booking here .",Bhavana Private Villas
25,Needs upgrading,30,May 2018,"We stayed at these villas last week, upon appearance looked lovely until looked further.
Needs maintenance done on our villa we stayed in, walls replastered, but bubbling and peeling away.shower door didn’t shut properly, lighting very dark and poor, outside bathroom needed a fan.
Towels were grey in colour and stained, although clean. Sheets had blood stains on them, pool towels very discoloured and on one occasion had holes in one.
Was suppose to have 2 bottles of water everyday , after 3rd day started to not get them and had to keep asking, was told on 5th day they were out of stock.
When put towels in bath to be renewed didn’t replace them had to keep asking when wanted new ones.
Breakfast was very poor, filled in forms for what wanted and on several occasions got the wrong breakfast, bread/ toast was stale.
Had problems with bats at our particular villa every day waking up to bat droppings everywhere and on sofas, sun beds, coffee table.
On one occasion the aircon was dripping water in bedroom over floor and dripping near the lights, called maintenance, sorted it out, but used our bath mat to wipe up water then put back in our bathroom to use, was filthy.
Pool was freezing as sun only got about 1/2 hrs on it, also no hand rail to get in or out of pool.

On good note the staff was very polite, but won’t be staying or recommending these villas sorry.",Bhavana Private Villas
26,5th return stay and as good as ever,50,October 2017,We have stayed at bahaha a five times and it has not disappointed. This is an ideal location to eat street yet not so close as to hear the noise of the traffic. The staff are super friendly. He beds super comfy and the pools incredibly large. We always enjoy returning!,Bhavana Private Villas
27,"Great overall, my list of pros and cons",40,May 2018,"Upon walking in, the villas are incredibly luxurious and impressive. Later on you begin to see small improvement points, but it is one of my most relaxing stays in 4+ star villas in Bali so far.

It should also be noted that there is no restaurant or bar, the nearest being two options within 100m walk, the rest (endless restaurants and bars) around 800m walk away on the same street.

Pros:
- Maintenance done 2x per day
- Very attentive and happy-to-help staff
- Staff member comes to the villa to cook breakfast each morning
- Extremely picturesque
- Sound system with bluetooth
- Good WiFi
- Staff won’t touch your personal belongings during maintenance
- Very close to all of the nice restaurants in the area (i do recommend a moped or taxis, plenty of moped parking provided)
- Mozzie coils lit, bed re-made and mozzie drapes let down every evening
- Full size pool, even in a 2-person villa

Cons:
- Room service was slow.. 30+ minute wait each time we ordered a slice of cake
- Towels go missing (easily replaced by calling reception however)
- Small maintenance issues... pool irregularly cleaned, lights not working etc
- minimal bar benu - choices consist of only of bintang, wine, and a small array of non-alcoholics
- very small choice of food as well.

Overall I give Bhavana a 4/5.
Maintenance and room service was a massive negative, but the noticeably great staff redeemed this.

I’d come here again with some improvements.",Bhavana Private Villas
28,Disappointing,20,March 2018,"I wouldn’t recommend these Villas at all. I booked for my partners birthday and experienced slow service, missing towels, unclean villas, and a strange breakfast. Why would you put mayonnaise on a fruit salad?!

The only service we enjoyed was the complimentary massage the girls did a fantastic job!

Very disappointing for the money you pay!",Bhavana Private Villas
29,Beautiful villas!,50,March 2018,"I stayed in a 1 bedroom villa last weekend and it was amazing. The villa looked exactly like the pics advertised and was very quiet and tranquil, the service was perfect and the staff very friendly and helpful. Great location also. I’d definitely stay again and recommend this villa!",Bhavana Private Villas
30,"Nice, convenient but tired",40,October 2017,"We stayed for 7 nights. Firstly staff make this place 4 star otherwise would probably give 3.5 based on maintenance. Breakfast served in your room is great. Nightly mozzie sprays and coils lit. Just really run down. Mould in showers, pool appliances and stereo didnt work which was fixed. Close to everything though. We also had a massage costing $120 aud on our anniversary which ended up being nothing like the Honeymoon massage they advertised (ended up being 3 hrs of repetitive massage no body scrubs etc included) so I wouldn't do that again. Over all nice and convenient but unless some serious maintenance is carried out probably wouldn't stay again. Again had the staff not bent over backwards probably would have been a harsher rating.",Bhavana Private Villas
31,Good location,40,August 2017,"We enjoyed our stay here and was very comfortable. Within walking distance to shopping, restaurants, beach etc. Staff were very pleasant and accommodating. My only criticism was the pool - the filtration didn't seem to be working efficiently .",Bhavana Private Villas
32,All round great place to stay,50,August 2017,"We recently stayed in a 1 bedroom villa and overall everything was pretty spot on. Villa is definitely spacious, and there are a lot of nice touches which make you think that management does care about the guest experience (and has answered some of the issues dealt with in negative reviews here). People mentioned mosquitos (you are staying in the tropics at a location which provides you with a private pool...) I personally had no issue with them and the same came through and lit mosquito coils each evening + there were matches provided to light your own. The outdoor area with fan was great, funnily enough I dont come on holidays to somewhere warm to sit inside in the air conditioning, it was pleasantly breezy and we didnt end up switching the fan on all. Breakfast cooked in the room was a nice touch, was it the finest gastoronomic delight Ive ever experienced, no, but did someone carry everything in on their head at the exact time I requested each morning and cook it for me in my room - yes, so I liked it and am definitely not complaining! Location is great, Eat Street is maybe 5min walk away,its seriously faster to walk to Seminyak Square than get any sort of shuttle with traffic.
Overall for a couple looking for some quiet time but still close enough to get to the action and a few nice touches around the place to make the experience a bit more memorable these villas are a fantastic option.
If your a business traveller concerned about mood lighting during meetings and whether the wifi will break the sound barrier perhaps do a search for a hotel with meeting rooms, a business hub etc and not private tropical villas...",Bhavana Private Villas
33,Comfortable but Tired,40,July 2017,"On the surface it looks great but it is starting to get a little tired and needs some maintenance and updating. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We tried most of the items on the included breakfast menu during our stay and enjoyed most of it. The portions were a good size and filled us up for the day ahead.
We enjoyed our stay and will be back again with the kids.",Bhavana Private Villas
34,"From outside wow,from inside?Not too wow",30,June 2017,"So,first of all you will notice that the location of the villa is a bit far from crowded street.Arrive at the villa greeted by a humble staff.Check in went quickly and we escorted to the room right away.First impression be like ""This is the best villa ever!"".Sadly after you dig deeper into the room(Me was two bedroom)you will find out that
1.A lot of mosquito
2.Bed cover were dirty with stain
3.Same apllies to the towel
4.Very dark light system
5.Limited power socket
6.Wifi are not too fast
Breakfast are quite not tasty,10 option available.For points 2-5 i still able to ingnore it.However the mosquitos are very irritating.Yes they have anti mosquitos curtain surrounding the bed,but the mosquitos still able to enter the bed through a small gap in each upper corner.This has disturbed my sleep.Management need to fix this.Pool is quite dirty,the filter system didnt work good enough
Note : if you stay on the right hand side villa,when you're on shower,people can actually saw you from the grand la villais hotel upper floor,so be careful",Bhavana Private Villas
35,Nice Villa for Family,50,June 2017,"The 2 bed rooms with the private pool so perfect for the family members. Strategic location, easy to find the food & go to the beach. The staff very helpfull & friendly. Absolutly will be back to this place.",Bhavana Private Villas
36,Challenging Property,20,June 2017,"1. Property is prominently marketed. 2. Only cooled section is bedroom so forget this place if want to mix leisure & work. 3. No provision for luggage store in bedroom. 4. Lighting is poor throughout. 5. All food is outsourced with a limited menu serving 2nd class & possibly poor hygiene meals suited more to religious sentiments without compromise. e. g. chicken sausage & imitation 'bacon' full of preservative chemicals. 6. Property would benefit from having its own decent restaurant. 7. No lounge, bar facilities. 8. No T. V. reception during the stay. 9. Security seems poor to absent. 10. Asking for a 1/2 day rate & airport transport hotel staff wanted cash only seems an irregular arrangement in what should be a well managed hotel in a prominent hotel group. 11. Hotel front desk not always attended & staff need guidance. 12. Hotel not suited to persons with special needs or need wheel chair access. 13. Hotel is not by any means a full service property. 14. Seminyak seems to have a 'used by date'. 15. Difficult to recommend this property unless nothing else going. 16. Hotel status & membership in Accor should be reviewed as a matter of priority.",Bhavana Private Villas
37,Good not great,30,June 2017,"Great location - short walk to eat street. Villa had an awesome layout. Friendly, helpful staff. Hade the potential to be great however not very clean. Bed sheets and towels were old and stained. Air conditioning wasn't very good.",Bhavana Private Villas
38,It's an old villa which is in dire need of renovation.,20,June 2017,"Our stay at Bhavana villa was unsatisfactory. we had a two bedroom villa and the rooms had substandard amenities - the taps were grimy and rusty, one of them wasn't fixed to the bathroom bench securely. the mosquito nets covering the four-post beds had 1"" gaps around the posts at the top. it seemed the roof thatching didn't meet the wall properly so there were geckos entering our room and waking us up with their night calls. The location is good, not far from 'eat street'. the hot water in the shower was good. the wifi kept dropping out. the staff are cheerful, although they don't clean the room very well. we had to ask them every day to change our towels, most of the towels smelled of 'damp' and the bedsheets did too. bedsheets had weird stains on them also. the cooked breakfasts were average. it's not a quiet villa complex..",Bhavana Private Villas
39,Loved it.. would recommend,40,April 2017,"We arrived here ""off the street"" as the villa we were staying at was very sub standard, they had a room available and would check us in that afternoon yaaay + a complimentary massage and breakfast included.

Location is good, approx 5 min walk to Seminyak Square and main street lined with plenty of shops and restaurants.

Our villa was 2 bed, 2 bath, big swimming pool, beds were very comfortable, mosquito nets around beds, very open - each night turn down service provided, blinds closed, mosquito nets closed, rooms sprayed with bug spray..

On the 2nd night the AC in my room lost cooling, rang reception and someone came down immediately to fix. Unfortunately it wasn't fixed, i called them again and they offered me another room for the night until the AC was fixed.

My birthday happened to fall whilst staying here, in the Afternoon the manager turned up with a cake and flowers!! I'm not a flower person but the gesture just shows the good nature of the Balinese people.

Had it not been for the AC being broken for 3 nights I would've given these guys a 5/5.. If I go back to Bali I will definitely be staying here again!",Bhavana Private Villas
40,Not what was expected,30,April 2017,"We arrived late at night and we were shown to our villa where everything looked amazing just like the web site except for the abundance of mozzies Sadly for Us that's where it all stopped. Used the toilet & nearly fell off it as it was broken and not secure. We went to bed as it had been a long day and the bed sagged into the middle so no matter how we tried to sleep it just wasn't happening the slats supporting it were broken. So with very little rest the next morning we went to use the shower which looked amazing only to find that too was broken, leaking as much water out of the hose connection as the shower head so not good at all. The tap on the vanity was only just usable as it was not connected to the basin so when you flicked the tap on it pulled out of the basin
The next thing was the pool pump was leaking water everywhere and making so much noise as it was not working properly. so to their defence, they came and fixed everything except the pump noise so we at least thought we could shower and sleep but nooo, the shower was great but the bed as soon as we hopped in it sagged and the slats fell through again so no sleep again. So needless to say our experience there was less than a pleasure. But again in their defence, they did do fobbing to reduce the mozzies. We may have just been unlucky as we only stayed 2 nights so we may have just been given a villa that was infarct under a maintenance program.
Unfortunately for me it was my first stay in a villa so it was disappointing to say the least",Bhavana Private Villas
41,Awesome!!,50,April 2017,"We booked the two bedroom villa with a private pool, was better than the photos! Staff were extremely helpful and friendly, cleaning in the morning then coming to spray the room for mosquitos in the evening, free American or Indonesian breakfast everyday and great location - could not speak higher! Thanks to the staff, we will see you again next time!! :)",Bhavana Private Villas
42,"Secret retreat metres from ""Eat Street""",50,May 2017,"We were staying at other villas in Seminyak that were just too far to walk to and from the restaurants, cafes and bars of Eat Street.
One morning we walked about and visited quite a few of the private villas in the area .... and then we found Bhavana Private Villas!
The staff helped out with a quick viewing and we decided right then we would move.
They arranged pick up from our previous villas and nothing was too difficult.

The villa itself awesome! Private pool, outdoor living area with kitchen dining abd lounge areas.
The bedroom has a 4 poster bed with mozzie netting and a very QUIET a/c which is great for a good sleep.
Beyond the bedroom is an indoor/outdoor bathroom and shower area with a double shower either indoor with hot/cold water or an outdoor cold only shower.
Lots of space and great visual design throughout.
We would recommend these villas!!",Bhavana Private Villas
43,Awesome,40,April 2017,Staffs are friendly and helpful but they need to work the cleanliness of utensils. They have in-house breakfast preparation which is really cool I think. The overall experience is superb. I would surely stay there again.,Bhavana Private Villas
44,Romantic getaway,50,March 2017,"Being our first international couples trip, we decided we wanted to splurge and have our own private villa. Bhavana looks exactly like the pictures! So exotic, cultural and cosy. The Villa was everything we had hoped for-- even breakfast prepared daily in our Villa! The staff were completely accommodating to all of our needs and the location was perfect. Just down the road from Seminyak Square and all of the yummy eateries. Staying here for 7 nights was magical, would completely recommend for any couple.",Bhavana Private Villas
45,Amazing experience,50,March 2017,"A worker named Bang Bang went above and beyond for my wife and I providing excellent advice, as well as helping us organise transfers to other places in Bali. The villa was perfect for privacy and a honeymoon, we had breakfast cooked for us each morning for free, Bang Bang also assisted us like a tour guide around Seminyak and areas close by. We had a fantastic stay here with all the staff being very helpful in almost anything we needed such as booking accommodation at other places or letting us know where we can book activities.

Bang Bang even drove us to Kuta when we wanted to go shopping....

5 star stay for us! 😁",Bhavana Private Villas
46,Beautiful villa in great location!,50,March 2017,"Stunning villa about 5 mins walk from Eat st, about the same to Seminyak square. Staff couldn't do enough for us.
Breakfast cooked for you in your villa every morning from a menu of about 8 things at the time you request.
The only down fall was the 'free drop off to Kuta and Seminyak' was never available as the driver was not working or on a pickup/ drop off from the airport. There are plenty of mozzies too - just like the rest of Bali, but they spray your room every night and light mosquito coils outside and in the room for you as part of the turn down service.
Would absolutely stay here again!",Bhavana Private Villas
47,Wonderful Stay,50,November 2016,"We stayed in November 2016. Staff were very friendly, cleaned our room each day & provided a mosquito treatment nightly, the Villa location was quite & kind of hidden. This was our first time in bali and didn't have many issues finding our way around. Villa is very close to all the restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay here, i enjoyed jumping in the pool each morning, playing music and the in-house massages. Would recommend this villa to anyone! Thank you Bhavana Villa for an amazing stay !",Bhavana Private Villas
48,Disappointing,30,December 2016,We were booked to stay for one week however by Day 3 the pool was murky and dirty and therefore unusable. The staff were very friendly. We had a two room villa but air conditioners in both bedrooms were broken down for two days each.,Bhavana Private Villas
49,Great location,40,January 2017,This is our second stay here and I highly recommend. The villas are very quiet and private but are well located to all the restaurants in Seminyak. Just a 5 minute walk down to eat street. The villas are a little on the tired side (but only just a little) but have a lovely garden and outdoor area right by the private pool. All the staff are super friendly too.,Bhavana Private Villas
50,Well nice but not nice,20,December 2016,Nice villa and all but it's dirty the staff are great and helpful but it really needs some cleaning you can't swim in the pool because frogs jump in lizards are all over the place bed sheets and towels are dirty the only nice thing here is the architecture of the villa and the staff,Bhavana Private Villas
51,"Good LocAtion, Affordable luxury villa",50,November 2016,"Very good. We had a two bedroom private villa with a pool. Breakfast could be a bit more better but still good. Ladies prepare your breakfast at your own villa.
Pricing is fair enough.
Close to (walking distance 5min max. And safe road) night life La Favella;)",Bhavana Private Villas
52,Bali getaway 2015,50,December 2015,"Our trip to Bali was awesome. We stayed @Bhavana Private Villas for 10days, a gift travel from our 3 kids. Bhavanas was the best experienced in my life. Their customer service was excellent, very friendly staff & clean villa to stay.",Bhavana Private Villas
53,Great stay,50,September 2016,"Loved our stay in the villas. Breakfast cooked in the villa each morning which was plentiful and very good. Airport shuttle included.
Welcome drink and fruit on arrival, lovely staff, always ready to help.
Only downside is the cleanliness of the place and particular the bedsheets.",Bhavana Private Villas
54,Just a Villa,20,August 2016,"When we arrived at the Bhavana Villas on Friday 19/8/2016 everything looked fantastic or was it? Staff greeted us straight away, they showed us a couple of villas,

The wi fi very average, the TV channels were not what was on the list, lighting very poor, they really did not clean he villa properly, just wipe over, not that clean.

The villas needs a serious makeover, great location, the staff very good.
Would I stay there again NO",Bhavana Private Villas
55,"Great location, beautiful Villa",50,September 2015,"An amazing stay at Bhavana Private Villas. This was my first trip to Bali and Bhavana Private Villas definitely made is memorable. In house beauty service, massage pedi etc, were reasonably priced and they also deliver and cook your breakfast in your own kitchen each morning. Close to a main strip with lots of restaurants. Highly recommend",Bhavana Private Villas
56,Nice but could have been better,30,August 2016,"We stayed in a single room villa with 3 beds. The villa is comfortable and very nice. Breakfast comes in the morning - good and large choice.
Only problem was the building works in the reception just next to us - which means that we had a lot of noise starting early in the morning and dust all day long.
This might have been just our villa but worth to let us know before.",Bhavana Private Villas
57,Average - fair and honest review,30,July 2016,"Great location and staff lovely, however I had read previous reviews about outdated decor and poor clealiness and this was all true. We did not received enough bath towels, if any!! Every day I had to ring to get towels and they were old and tattered. Kitchen was old (mouldy fridge) and bathrooms did not looked cleaned. Cleanliness poor - our sheets were stained and dirty upon arrival (which I had read in another review but didn't believe possible) and looked like they had not replaced the sheets after previous guests, had them replaced and the new ones still had stains. The villas have such potential they just need to replace all linen and replace decor old for new. Staff were VERY helpful but I think not given the help or training they need to actually bring this to a 4 star??? Too expensive for what it was. Pool area ok however close to tiling floor so not suitable with youngsters/kids very slippery. Wouldn't go back unless improved.",Bhavana Private Villas
58,Average,30,July 2016,Average accomodation. Forgot small things like water and new towels along with coat hangers. The pillows were hard and gave my partner a very sore neck. My friends slept on their aeroplane pillows. My bath was very stained so I didnt want to use. The breakfast was ok... One day the tomatos werent cooked and the eggs benedict was served on bread instead of toast. Lovely reception and bangbang was very smily and lovely to deal with.,Bhavana Private Villas
59,Fabulous place - great location - wonderful staff,50,July 2016,"This is our third time staying in private villas in Bali. The Bhavana Private Villas did not disappoint us.

The location of the Villas is terrific (a leisurely stroll to a number of places of interest), and the staff were brilliant. Before arriving they were more than happy to help with airport transfers, to book dinner reservations for my wife and I, and day trips. During our stay they could not have been more accommodating.

The Villa was clean, and a good size. It is clear some effort has gone into reducing mosquitoes and other critters. As one expects in Bali, the living area is outdoors. This means bringing mosquito coils and wearing Bushman, Aeroguard or other repellent — just as we do in summer in Brisbane.

The bedroom is enclosed and air conditioned. While we are accustomed to the heat and humidity, it provides a nice break after a day outside in the heat.

The Villas are great value for money. We recommend them highly.",Bhavana Private Villas
60,Not like the pictures,30,June 2016,"Stayed 3 nights in June 2016.
Read allot of reviews on the place with issues about the cleanliness of the villas. The online pictures look amazing, but after visiting the reviews all seem to be correct. Ive travelled enough through SE Asia to not be upset by this, but if your expecting what you have seen in the photos you will be let down.
Pool was filthy, with missing tiles and mouldy grout, first thing I said when got to the Villa was ""no way we are going into that filthy pool"". Outdoor furniture had stains all over them. We went straight to the shower after a big day of travelling and found a large clump of womens hair inside (this did not go down well with my gf)! So quite obviously no one had cleaned. dirty grout and cracked tiles throughout.
Also I have read many reviews about the towels that are never replaced. This is also correct. Our wet dirty towels were just folded and left on the benches. There was never any issue just calling through reception for more though, they would bring them straight down.

On the plus side the bed was really cumfy.
Breakys were pretty good, cooked for you in your villa. You select your breakfast time, dont expect them to be punctual! We didnt have an issue with that though as we were never in a rush.
Staff are pretty helpful and respectful. Once checked in they really dont bother you which is nice.
You can also rent scooters from the hotel for 60,000 RP a day.
Location is also pretty good, short 400m walk to main strip.",Bhavana Private Villas
61,Paradise,40,June 2016,"Love the villas here, they are spacious and comfortable. The pool is fabulous and having the breakfast cooked in villa is incredible. This is our 2nd trip here & loved it just as much as the 1st time. The only thing that lets it down a bit is the breakfast which is a bit limited so can get boring if you are here for more than 3 days.
We were offered a free dinner which turns out to be a seafood dinner. As (unusually we know) we don't like seafood the only other option is off the in room dining menu which from past experience is average. Much nicer food out on the street a short walk away. The walk to the restaurants is about 10 minutes in the heat but if you choose your time it's not too bad. The resort offers complimentary airport transfers but no transfer to other resorts or anywhere else when you leave.
The TV doesn't work and it didn't work last time either & nobody has been to fix it, not that we really want to watch it. There is a pod coffee machine here that wasn't here last stay so perhaps that is the upgrade I read about. Beds are firm and we love the outdoor bathroom which has 2 showers and a deep bath.",Bhavana Private Villas
62,you get what you pay for,20,May 2016,"We found these Villas in a great location. But they are not very clean, the towels were all worn and had stains all over them. There was vermin there as well, kept finding poo on the couch, in the cupboards and on my clothes. The mosquitto net has never been washed in its life. On the up side the pool was great. the aircon in the bedroom barely worked. the pillows were hard and the sheets poor.",Bhavana Private Villas
63,Amazing,50,May 2016,"We stayed at Bhavana Private Villas for 12 nights and it was amazing. Lovely staff, villa was really nice and in a great location. Breakfast cooked in the villa each morning that was very tasty.
Will definitely be back.",Bhavana Private Villas
64,Could of been better,30,April 2016,"I booked villa 16 myself and was quite pleased with photos and reviews. It was our first top on our honeymoon list.
Upon arrival at the airport I found our driver easily, very kind. Awkard to give a tip coz we didn't have small change :/
The lobby was nice and open but we were told to sit down and nothing else. Had no idea what was happening until they gave us a form 5 mins later..
Our villa was lovely. Right down the back, a good walk! Being we werent accustomed to the heat and humidity i found the air to be dirty and almost unbearable.
Anyway, pool came in handy after walking around seminyak 5 mins away or back from kuta 10-15 mins taxi. Always cold!! Loved it. Although my husband is a pool cleaner and quickly noticed the pool was not being cleaned and after a few days was murky aka dirty.

Daily breakfast was awesome thought. The juice tasted like cordial/fruit drink and not fruit juice.

We were here for 7 nights and each day they forgot something. Replace a towel, snacks, forget 1 thing from breakfast like fruit, pastries, coffee??

ALSO we only had SOAP and no personal items supplied at the very least there shouldve been shampoo & conditioner??

It was ok. Location was perfect. The place it self out dated and probably wouldnt stay at this place again.. sorry :/",Bhavana Private Villas
65,Get ready to feel like Royalty!,50,April 2016,"We booked with them for our honeymoon and it was incredible. From the driver who picked us up from the airport to the bath that was run with fresh rose petals in it upon our arrival.

The staff were so helpful and genuinely friendly but they do a great job of respecting your privacy and we felt like the only people in the entire place. The villas are amazing- huge comfortable bed, great AC and the pool is bigger than I expected! outdoor shower and bathtub, good wifi, breakfasts cooked in your villa each morning. Complete luxury.

They booked restaurants and trips for us too.

Loved every minute of it!",Bhavana Private Villas
66,Beautiful,50,April 2016,"Awesome, beautiful, relaxing place to stay. Staff are friendly. Breakfast is a great treat cooked in your own villa! Close to everything, yet far enough away to think you were not in a city. Love everything. I'd recommend this place for families or large groups. Medium price range (compared to Australia) but value for money",Bhavana Private Villas
67,2nd Honeymoon Bliss,50,March 2016,"We stayed at Bhavana for 7 nights and would highly recommend it. It is located in Seminyak and a place we hadn't stayed before however location was central to restaurants and shopping. Staff were beautiful, breakfast each morning was delish, pool cold and refreshing and so peaceful. Thank you Bang Bang and staff and we look forward to seeing you again soon 😊",Bhavana Private Villas
68,A pleasant stay,40,February 2016,"Arrived at Denpassar and greeted by driver waiting in arrival hall. Vehicle clean and comfortable. It was a 25 minute drive to the villa. Greeted warmly by staff and given a refreshing mojito mocktail as we completed the formalities. We were given Villa 11, a one bedroom Villa.

The Villa was clean and met expectations. Pool large and deep (3 X 6m, 1.6m deep, depth whole length of pool). Water clean and a good temperature. Lovely lush gardens. Villa very private and quiet. Outdoor living area comfortable, no leaks from rain. There is a ceiling fan which provided a gentle breeze. The furniture was in good condition. There was a 40"" LG LCD TV with about 60 international channels including ABC news 24, Nat Geo, CNN, Fox and a few movie channels. There also was a 3500w hi-fi system with iPod dock (which had a faulty connector) and Bluetooth - great for playing tunes as you relax in the pool. Kitchen clean with a Nespresso machine (including 6 assorted capsules) and a large cold fridge (no milk - easily bought from mini-mart). Cupboard doors slightly faded from wear and tear. Spring water dispenser on bench also (very handy for refilling used water bottles).

Breakfast ordered the day before at reception and cooked at our chosen time in the villa. There was good choice however the quality of the food was hit and miss. The American breakfast was served with cold (literally stone cold!) sausages which had more filler than meat inside. Also some breakfasts were served with cold mashed potato?!. The Mi/Nasi Goreng was tasty, but again served with cold chicken wings (though tasty!). The omelet was quite nice too. All breakfasts came with a fruit platter also. Room service is cooked at a nearby cafe. Very good prices, good choice and good quality - especially their sandwiches.

Bedroom comfortable. Mattress on the firmer side but still comfortable. Again, furniture in good condition. 32"" TV in bedroom. Air conditioning crispy cold but a tad noisy at times with a rattling noise coming from the outdoor system. There was a nightly turn down service at 7pm where the room was sprayed for mosquitoes, the mosquito net put down, curtains pulled and lights dimmed. They also put coils in the outside living area.

Bathroom clean, but showing its age from wear and tear. Shower had good water pressure but screen would not stay shut, meaning water from shower made its way onto the bathroom floor. The hose for the shower head was grimey. Wooden soap dispensers faded. Limited toiletries but great smelling hand wash.

The villa is in a good location, close but far away enough from the buzz and crowds on the main streets of Seminyak. An easy 5 minute walk to Eat Street, 10 minutes walk to Seminyak square and about 15 minutes walk to Seminyak Beach. Reception staff happy to book taxis (we always get Bluebird) and assist with booking tours and hiring scooters. Staff are lovely and are very accommodating and welcoming.

Overall our experience was very good and would likely stay again. However, certain things could do with upgrading and repair, such as the bathroom (ie. Painting and refreshing tiles, new soap dispensers) and replacing the doors in the kitchen. The artwork in the living areas is a bit dated and could easily be replaced to give the Villa more charm and appeal. Breakfast could be improved, ie. Better quality ingredients, and heating up sausages or cooking them in the villa (I assume they are cooked outside the villa?). Also, while the room was cleaned daily, supplies were not routinely and consistently restocked, ie. Coffee pods only replaced on day 3 and water bottle replacement missed one day.

All in all though we had a pleasant stay at Bhavana.",Bhavana Private Villas
69,Great value for money,40,July 2015,Great location just off the main restaurant street. Villas are little tired but great value for money. Loved having breakfast cooked every morning in our own villa kitchen. Courtyard didn't get much sun which meant the private pool was pretty cold most of the time. Staff were amazing. Would highly recommend staying here.,Bhavana Private Villas
70,Its a bargain!,50,February 2016,"The staff is just simply amazing. All of them are very friendly, helping and extremely positive! The atmosphere is just stunning.
The villa itself it exceeds expectations. It is very clean, quiet, it has all that you need inside. For breakfast they will come and cook for you, which is extraordinary and fresh ! The pool is exactly what you need, with a good depth, clean water, beautiful waterfall with a relaxing atmosphere.
The villa also has a ""book"", i call it that way because it has a lot of pages, where you will find anything about everything in Bali.

In closure, they offer an amazing deal for a fair price! I recommend it for couples as well as for family / friends.",Bhavana Private Villas
71,"Good, but....",30,February 2016,"My boyfriend and I stayed here in February 2016 in a one bedroom villa. The layout and appearance of the villa was very nice but there was some problems. We arrived in the evening and were informed that there were no towels available until the next day as they were being laundered. The pool did not appear clean and we only used it once as it was murky and didn't look inviting. It was also a little disappointing that a venue of this price didn't provide shampoo, conditioner and soap either. It rained during our stay and there were some serious water leaks over the kitchen which I thought was dangerous as it was running through the light fitting and made the floor very slippery. On the positives time villas are in an excellent location, being about 5mins walk from Seminyak square and the staff were lovely and accommodating. I think it is a good venue, but maybe we were there at a time when most of the staff were on holidays so it wasn't as good as it could have been.",Bhavana Private Villas
72,One bedroom pool villa,30,February 2016,"We stayed in a one bedroom pool villa and was disappointed with the cleanliness of it. The pool is in need of big clean, scale and slim build up, leaves and dirt in the pool and the surrounding pathways. The fridge/freezer was not clean and the freezer had not been defrosted for sometime. The bed dipped in the middle, so you rolled while trying to sleep. Unfortunately even the bathroom gets a negative mention! One bath & pool towel each but no bath mat, hand towel or face washers. We were told that the pump soap dispenser doubled up as shampoo, lucky we had our own. On a positive note the staff were very nice and helpful. The villas are in a fantastic position and walking distance to 'eat street'. But it's in urgent need of 'spring cleaning'",Bhavana Private Villas
73,Great Villa,40,February 2016,"We were picked up from the airport and got a wonderful welcoming reception. We were a bit disappointed at first with the villa, as the pool pump wasn't working and some of the lights weren't. However, once we rung them and asked them to sort it and they were there straight away ensuring everything was fixed. They were great at cleaning the room but we did have to constantly ask for refills of the coffee and sugar. Don't get me wrong here it was a great villa and we will stay there again. They were really great when we asked for something to be refilled. Very helpful and caring. Plus checkout is at 1pm but we didn't want to leave until 3pm and so they let us stay in the villa for the extra two hours with no charge. The beds were so comfortable and the air-conditioning was great. The Pool - well it just fabulous!",Bhavana Private Villas
74,Great staff.,30,January 2016,"As coming from a hotelier, I think service should be on the top followed by the amenities in the villa. N I would rate 5/5 for the excellent service they have given me during my stay. A very quiet villa. Breakfast was okay. Not too bad. The chef will drop by your villa to cook the breakfast for you. The living room is pretty hot during the afternoon sun as there's only 1 ceiling fan which is not that useful. I guess they need to install more fans. But there's a lot of mosquitoes here. So don't forget your repellent. Other than that I don't see any faulty issues. Abit far from the tourist spot.

Thank you for your service.",Bhavana Private Villas
75,Our amazing mini moon,40,December 2015,"I got married 3 weeks ago and my husband I were looking for a nearby relaxing holiday destination (we live in Singapore) and we finally decided on Bali. It was our first time staying in a villa so naturally we were a little apprehensive as we did not know what to expect. However, the staff at Bhavana private villas went all out to make sure that they cleaned the rooms well and to place mosquito coils and bug spray around the villa. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff very attentive and they had a quick response when we called for anything we needed. We were greeted with a smile every morning and the staff helped us with any enquiries we had. The location is good as it's near seminyak nightlife and bars and restaurants. I would recommend this place to couples and families alike.",Bhavana Private Villas
76,Lovely staff and lots of potential but.....,20,October 2015,"So much was broken or didn't work or was not quite adequate. The place needs maintenance and some attention to detail. The aircon in the bedroom was good, but the fan in the living area was inadequate, especially in the afternoon when the sun filled the entire living area... some blinds would be very useful!

The toiletries were inadequate despite being wrapped up prettily. There was no shampoo! There were insufficient mosquito coils. The hairdryer was useless... The nespresso machine didn't work, there was only powdered milk to use, and the ""fully functional"" kitchen was grotty and pretty useless as there were no pots or pans. Even the plants appeared under loved.
A bit of TLC and the place would be very nice.

The staff made a fuss of my birthday, and that was greatly appreciated. A lovely surprise!",Bhavana Private Villas
77,With refurbishment could be great,30,October 2015,"Good location. Lovely staff. The overall layout of the villa was pleasant, particularly the outdoor area by the pool. However aspects of the villa need some serious refurbishment, notably the kitchen and bathroom areas. With refurbishment Bhavana could be great",Bhavana Private Villas
78,Highly recommended,40,October 2015,"Had a lovely stay here. Great staff. Great location. Couldn't have been happier. Exceeded expectations. Would definitely stay here again.
We stayed in a one bedroom villa and found it very comfortable. Breakfast cooked daily in villa and the complimentary in villa dinner was wonderful.",Bhavana Private Villas
79,"You can get better value for money, not great!",20,October 2015,"Arrived to a 2 bedroom villa expecting it to look as good as it did in the pictures. Place is tired and a little run down. The bathroom not so clean with black grime around shower edge of the floor. Kitchen we didn't use as we felt it was grubby and the smell from u der the kitchen sink cupboard was disgusting. We had to ask for new towels and in a 6 day stay they did it once. No DVD player as cable was missing upon staff checking. Mozzies really bad preventing you from swimming in the pool and sitting outside. Breakfast is bad bad bad! Cold and yuk. We were promised a late check out and never got it but the offered to look after our luggage until we left.
Bed was comfortable, blinds in bedroom broken needing a fix up.
I've been to Bali 4 times now and would not choose to stay here again and I agree you can do better for your money.
Wifi hopeless!
Staff are nice but service a little crappy.
Upon reading the not so great reviews I'd have to say that they are all pretty much spot on. And also reDing the GM response it appears to be pretty much a standard response to every review.
Next time I will look elsewhere but all the same not to bad but not good",Bhavana Private Villas
80,Mostly fine but a wonky start,30,September 2015,"We waited at the airport for an hour for our transfer to the Villas, despite then having our flight number and saying they would be there. The hotel clerk lied to us twice on the phone saying the driver was already at the airport when he clearly hadn't left yet. Eventually on the third phone call he came clean and said it would be another 15 mins. We were really annoyed not so much at the late pick up but at the lack of honesty.

The Villa was beautiful and exactly as you would want for a luxury break. The service for breakfast was great and that ingredients were mostly great (the ham for the eggs benedict was interesting). My bath robe was dirty and had on it what I hoped was a chocolate stain. I put this out of be washed but it was not replaced. Then when my partner's bath robe also went to be washed we were left without either. Some days we would have new towels, some days there were none, though the old ones were taken. The complimentary bottles of water for brushing your teeth often did not turn up either and we had to buy our own.

The only other sticking point was the tile cutter being used each day (for our whole 4 night stay) from around 8am in the Villa next to ours. Not exactly relaxing.

Overall it was good value for money because we got it at a discount, however the lack of organisation in the background was a bit out of keeping with the beautiful Villas. We would use again if we couldn't find other decently priced luxury Villas in Seminyak, but then there are a lot about!",Bhavana Private Villas
81,Come On Bhavana You Can Do It!!,30,September 2015,"We stayed in a two bedroom villa for 7 nights. The location was really good, walking distance to just about anywhere you'd want to go in Seminyak Oberoi.
We interacted mainly with front desk girl Sisca and Pak Bangbang who are FANTASTIC!
The villa has potential, it was good but it could be great! There were ALOT of little things that are being overlooked that would make a huge difference to the guest experience!",Bhavana Private Villas
82,Nice place,40,September 2015,"Stayed for a weekend. The villa was nice. Good pool. Nice bedroom, sitting room and bathroom. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. It is a bit of a walk from the main street, but it was not a problem. Only downside was the quality of the food. It was not very good. Breakfast was cooked for us in our villa every morning. There was no central restaurant. Lovely idea, but then the cooking facilities were limited and the result often poor. Tried room service and it was poor too.",Bhavana Private Villas
83,Two bedroom villa.,40,September 2015,"We stayed at the Bhavana Private Villas for four nights in September. We took our 11 month old and stayed with two other friends in a two bedroom villa. We got a great deal, through another website, that included breakfast, so it pays to shop around. Wifi and shuttle service included but I think if we had paid the rack rate then a few more luxuries would have been expected.
We stayed in Villa number 10 and it was fine for what we needed. Didn't get too much sun and the phones didn't work, but this was something out of their control and it was nothing to potter down to reception. Not the most pushchair friendly entrance as there were a couple of stairs and once inside our villa there were stepping stones to get to the main area. This was ok as we just left the stroller by the door and staff helped me up if I flying solo with the stroller.

VILLA;
• Bedrooms both have aircon, a TV, a wardrobe, a safe and a make up/dresser mirror so that you could put your make up on in the aircon! A four poster canopy bed, but if you're fussy with your pillows then take your own! They were too high/firm for me but my partner thought they were fine. We also requested a baby cot in our room which came with a mosquito net too. You get two shower towels and two pool towels in each room but we really needed more because of the baby and had to ask a couple of times for extra dry ones. It was never a problem and they were replaced each day.

• Ensuite bathroom is all open so if Mosquitos love you, take repellant. There is an outdoor rain shower, a normal shower, a vanity with a sink and a bath. The bathrooms could do with a little loving attention, as one of our lights flickered on and off, the plug in the sink wouldn't come out and the corners of the shower door could have done with a scrub. These weren't big enough issues that we thought needed to be fixed whilst we were there, and I'm sure if we had mentioned it, staff at Bhavana would have happily fixed everything. There is a hairdryer (in a drawer in the wardrobe) but minimal toiletries and only a soap dispenser in the shower and a bar of soap. Two daily complimentary bottles of water a day were also provided.

• Main living area consists of a small kitchen and living/dining area and leads into the pool.
The kitchen had a sink, fridge, gas hotplate, kettle, cutlery, crockery, glassware and a water fountain. There were a few pans and other bits in there but we never used them. No microwave, which would have been handy for heating baby food, but we hired what we needed (steriliser, bottle warmer) from Bali Baby Hire.
Dining/living area had a day bed, sofa, TV (with movies and children's channels), 6 seat dining table, Dolche Gusto coffee machine and pods, tea and coffee and music dock with Bluetooth to link to your smartphone.
Pool led straight off the living room and was an ok size. A little too cold for our little one, but perfect for us to jump into after a day out. Clean, well kept and two sunbeds off to one side. Just be careful of the tiled floor (most villas we've stayed at have the same issue) as it gets a little treacherous when wet!! We just kept our towels and sandals on the edge to mop up the splashes. Ceiling fan in the main room is strong enough to keep you cool and as it is all open, it is beautiful to sit outside of a morning and hear all the birds.

FOOD;
Breakfast was included and plentiful. Lots of options to choose from. Eggs (however you like) bacon, sausage, tomato, mashed potato(?), toast, croissants, fruit, pancakes, eggs benedict... Coffee we had from the Nespresso (or Sisterfeilds) and you also get fruit juice. All cooked in your villa at whatever time you choose! No complaints with food whatsoever!

STAFF;
The staff at Bhavana were fantastic. Any requests we had they did as much as they could to fulfil them, they were all so friendly and absolutely terrific with our little girl. They even involved her in feeding the fishes, knew her name and made her laugh all the time and made us feel so welcome. Each night they came to spray the rooms and light mosquito coils. Housekeeping was always done whilst we were out.
We would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff at Bhavana!

LOCATION;
Great location! Off the main strip in Seminyak, so it was nice and quiet but still central. Next door to K Villas, about an eight minute walk to Sisterfeilds, a slow 10 minute walk to Ultimos, slow 15 minute walk to Seminyak square and about 15-20 minute walk to Potato Head. A mini mart is two minutes down the road, a great laundry was just one minute away, really cheap and quick. They even repaired my shorts that ripped five minutes before we left for the airport!!

Overall we were very happy with the Bhavana Villas. Maybe a little TLC needed in some areas but that certainly wouldn't put us off staying there again!

Hope that helps you with your decision! Happy holidays!",Bhavana Private Villas
84,Best place for us in seminyak,50,August 2015,"We loved Bhavana from start to finish. Stayed 4 days and enjoyed every minute. All Staff were excellent. Polite and hard working and helpful. The villas are a gorgeous retreat from the heat and bustle. Short walk to JL seminyak if we wanted to shop or buy produce. Handy to great restaurants and services. Adored the private pools, the 2 large TVs and sound system. Nice and generous breakfasts- we tried everything. Nespresso coffee machine was a treat. Good aircon in bedroom and choice of bath and 2 showers indoor or outdoor. We'll be back for sure and recommend as value for money.",Bhavana Private Villas
85,Average experience,30,August 2015,"The villa itself was good. The location great, 2min walk to the Main Street and the staff always friendly and smiling. That's where our positive experience ends. The breakfast was average at best and the Indonesian breakfast the worst - it was cold. When it says cook in your room, they mean the eggs only. It was also the little things like staff coming in to clean your room every day whilst you are there, our bar fridge never being re-filled, three days worth of cans/ rubbish recyclables not picked up (even though we put them in a plastic bag next to the bin) and room service dishes left on the bench on more than one occasion for two days. We got this room at a discount price, and even at this price the room is not worth what we paid.",Bhavana Private Villas
86,We didn't want to leave,40,July 2015,"We stayed here 9 nights as a couple- very relaxing, well priced, nice villas, the cooked breakfast was good,but was way too much food at times (if thats a complaint?!) Enjoyed going out and coming back to a clean place.The location was really good- few minutes walk to eatstreet and shops and was a cheap cab to other areas. The staff are very friendly and helpful and quick to respond to a request.It was our first trip to Bali and we will be going back.
Could do with a few minor maintenance fix ups but not enough to complain about.",Bhavana Private Villas
87,Rod prestia,50,June 2015,"Fantastic place to stay very Central the villas are awesome and the staff are all first class and helpful.

Breakfast is above average and have them cook it in your villa is a nice touch

The thing that makes this place are the staff forever helpful and always smiling. Just a short stroll to all that Seminyak has to offer its great value and we really enjoying it will definitely boom here again",Bhavana Private Villas
88,Great place,40,June 2015,"We have just spent the last 5 nights here. We thought the villas were well laid out and had everything we needed for our stay.
The customer service was great - initially we were told we couldn't have a late checkout as the villas were fully booked but luckily the day before departing they could offer us a late checkout. Definitely needed when you have an 11pm flight that is delayed!
Breakfast was included in our package - the omelettes and scrambled eggs or Nasi goreng were the best out of the options available.
Great location - close to restaurants, bars or very easy to get a cab to wherever you want to go.
Will return!",Bhavana Private Villas
89,Nice but not great,30,June 2015,"Spent a few days with my adult daughter. The villas are a bit tired. Our toilet didn't flush and we called reception 3 times. Only once did a person come to fix it. Bedroom extremely comfortable. Bathroom has shower and bath. Private pool cool, so refreshing when you're hot! Funny deal with the 'American breakfast'. A lady turns up and cooks the breakky in the villa. Eggs, omelette, pancakes on offer. Croissants and other pastries provided. We couldn't eat the 'bacon' and 'sausages' - not much meat in either. Coffee plunger in room, but only dry instant coffee (2 satchets) and 2 tea bags!
Plunger used by breakky lady if you order Java coffee. Not to my taste, but might suit others. Room service unbelievably dreadful! Got (cooked) frozen peas,corn, carrot mixture with pork ribs last night. We tried room service twice and dreadful both times.",Bhavana Private Villas
90,Excellent location,40,May 2015,"I really liked Bhavana Private Villas, they are in a great location and walking distance to all the restaurants and shops in Seminyak. The Villas are nicely laid out with an open air kitchen, lounge and an airconditioned bedroom. This was my second stay there and they do need some work on them again to get them up to date. The general cleaning of the villas was good but the whole place needed painting and general maintenance, especially the pool area. I could see the workmen in other villas so I realise this is being done. Another suggestion for the staff would be to perhaps ring on the phone each villa 5 minutes before they bring you breakfast, that way you have time to be at the door of the villa when your breakfast arrives. This will save the staff having to bang on the door and disturb the neighbours as it is hard to hear in the bedroom if someone as at the front gate. I really enjoyed our stay and hope to return again in the future.",Bhavana Private Villas
91,Honest and kind staff,50,April 2015,"I did not stay at this resort but wish I could have! We stopped there to ask for help in directions after my taxi driver couldn't find my accommodation. The staff, who speak excellent English, did not question helping me and even called my accommodation to get directions to give to the taxi driver. Because I wanted to look at 2 options they even kept my huge suitcase and the delivered it to me by motorbike after dropping me off as the road my hotel was on was too small for a taxi! This type of genuine kindness shows the true lovely Balinese people which is great in a place where you are often ripped off by taxi drivers taking extra long routes, and every other person quoting you silly high tourist prices! The villas look lovely also, and though he villa is away from the busy streets and beach the peace and quiet is worth it. I wish I'd had the budget to stay myself!",Bhavana Private Villas
92,Had a nice time!,40,April 2015,I was very apprehensive about my stay here as I had read quite a lot negative reviews about the villa. So the villa is about a 30 mins drive from the airport and Mr.Bang Bang came to pick us up. He is a gem of a person. You can take all the guidance from him about Bali and its exotic locations and he will give you genuine opinions. The villa is located a little bit inside of seminyak but you can easily get a taxi which are cheap and safe. The villa is really a private home away from home. The staff is highly helpful and is always ready to solve any issues. The breakfast tastes average but enjoyable. The villa was kept clean throughout my stay which was satisfying for me. The beaches and restaurants are at a walking distance. Overall my experience with bhavana private villa was good. Just go with an open and free mind and enjoy.,Bhavana Private Villas
93,Best customer serivce!,50,April 2015,"We just spent 6 days at Bhavana Villa's as a family of 4 with 2 children ages 3 and 1 and stayed in the 2 bedroom villa. We were met at the airport for our free transfer by one of the most accommodating people I have met in my life and his name was ""Bang Bang"". I had contacted him by email even prior to our stay and he was very helpful to help us plan our stay even before we arrived. Throughout our entire stay he always had a positive attitude and quickly became my 3 year olds best friend because he let him feed the fishes every morning. The villa itself I felt was located in a nice part of seminyak that could have been easy to walk but since we had 2 children we took a taxi everywhere we went and from seminyak to kuta it was only $4 USD so the taxi's are VERY cheap. The Villa is all outdoors except for the bedroom, the bedroom is the only part that has air conditioning. I have a read a few negative reviews of this villa, but before you stay in this villa or any other villa for that matter rather than staying in a hotel you need to be aware that your living room and bathroom although they are private they are outdoors so yes there will be bugs. Knowing this information the bhavana staff comes to your room once every night to spray for bugs and set candles for mosquito repellant. Mr. Bang Bang helped us make reservations for Bali Zoo and and also our favorite was Waterbom which was a water park that my children loved. I would highly recommend staying at bhavana villas a for a private getaway. If you have kids they will also place a pool fence around the private pool, they have a baby crib and also a baby high chair will be provided in your villa. Bhavana also offers 24hour room service and includes sending someone to your villa to cook you a FULL breakfast every morning, we actually ended up only ordering 3 meals instead of 4 because it was so much food that we could never finish it all but my kids loved the waffles and french toast.",Bhavana Private Villas
94,So disappointed we checked out early!,10,February 2015,"UNLOVED! This can be the only way I could describe this accommodation. As a fairly even minded traveller it takes a bit for me to move hotels once I'm in. This is probably the first occasion I have experienced a $300 per night hotel which was of lesser quality than the $120 per night hotel we moved to. From the lack of signposting externally (I actually walked past the entry and missed it - twice) to the cleanliness of the unit: it felt as if they didn't care whether anyone stayed there or not. Not one cab driver knew the property and we used 4 taxis over the three days we stayed. We had to direct the cabbies. We had booked (and paid) for 5 nights but couldn't bear more than 3. Issues: on arrival we were impressed by the quality of the reception but nearly got taken out by low hanging branches on the way to our villa. Front gated entry lock to our villa was broken and the doorbell did not work -didn't need to I suppose as we couldn't lock the gates😉 Kitchen was grotty and plunge pool was surrounded by trees which looked as if they had not been pruned in years - result was constant falling of leaf litter into an already grimy pool and bird droppings on silly me sitting in the shade! After pointing out the former to the staff they did attend to repairs to the lock, and swept up leaf litter so we could actually use pool lounges. Next morning when the cleaners came we asked could they do a bit of extra cleaning in the bathroom as the shower and the basin were really disgusting. To our dismay it appeared no better after they finished. The straw that broke the camels's back? The lack of a shuttle as the 'driver' was sick for the duration of our stay except when we checked out early! The location of the villa meant it was a fair walk to a couple of the nicest restaurants on the beach which we wanted to try, and considering the roads to and from the villa had no footpaths, we were nervous about walking them in the dark. Suffice to say we left a commentary with them, and we hope to receive a response from the email we will send to their GM - which might make it look like they really do want customers. My advice would be: look at something a bit cheaper. You will probably get much better value for money.",Bhavana Private Villas
95,Perfect girls holiday,50,January 2015,"We have just stayed 6 nights at the Bhavana villa. There were 6 of us girls staying in a two bedroom villa, a week getaway leaving the husbands and children behind !
The villas are fabulous ! They are extremely spacious and well thought out ! Each room is ensuited with a big indoor/outdoor style
bathroom. The bedrooms are well set up with continuous air con, big comfortable bed and the roll in bed is a proper bed (not like in Australia !) pool is crystal blue and refreshing! The staff are kind and helpful.
For all those that complain about breakfast, I would suggest you take a look at how they come in and cook breakfast on the 2 ring stove ?! They arrive at your villa with all the ingredients they set your table and then they cook
however many breakfasts you've ordered, they time it so it's all ready together and it's on facilities like we might have for camping ! And the breakfast is fine and plenty ! We found the sweeter options better than the eggs.
Great cleanliness villa was cleaned beautifully everyday and a lovely turn down service at night with a mossie spray ! Which we did not have a problem with either !
If your on your way to Bhavana villas you won't be disappointed ! Enjoy !
Have loved Every minute of our Bali holiday !",Bhavana Private Villas
96,"nice villas , great staff",40,January 2015,"My family just spent 14 days at the villa's, we had a 1 bedroom villa, we found the villa's very comfortable and plenty of room. The bedroom is huge and has a flat screen tv inside, the bed king size bed has a mozzie net all around which is very handy as the mozzies can be frequent, the bathroom is really cool it is attached to the bed room and is semi open, with a bath, shower and and another shower which is open.
the longe room and pool area are fantastic in its design, as the outdoor lounge room opens up to the swimming pool, the pools are a good size and very clean, there is a good stero system in the lounge area and a couple of good size couches.
the villa's are cleaned daily and turned down in the evening.
The staff are great, super friendly and polite nothing is too much troubleand they can organise drivers , food or baby sitters, they will book activities for you also.
we got a baby sitter called Mardi, she was a lovely lady who looked after our girl like she was her own, we got her through the villas, i can highly recommend her if you want a baby sitter.
The villas are close to the main road about 400mt walk, where there are more resturants, bars, shops than you could ever need, so the location is great.
The only critical point i could bring up, is Bhavana villas you really must improve your breakfast, it is average, it will not take much to improve it, but use real bacon, and fresh fruit juice not cordial, cook everything fresh, as the sausages are precooked and so is the hash Brown's, if you can fix this and you really should you will have alot better place.
but all in all, very good vills, well worth going and staying there, lovely staff, well priced and fantastic rooms, the staff love kids and are beautiful people, Radit is a champion and all the staff are a credit to the villas.",Bhavana Private Villas
97,great location,40,December 2014,"My husband,myself and our daughter and her partner stayed in the 2 brm pool Villa for 3 nights for the xmas period.
Everything from the airport transfers to checking in and out went very smoothly.
Good size villas with a large cool pool.
We stayed in villa 10 so no road noise.
Breakfast was cooked in the room each morning and was a good standard.
Large clean bathrooms and comfortable beds.
The staff assisted us in bookings to restaurants and also boat transfers over to Lembonan Island.
We loved the location with only a 5 min walk to eat street and our favourite restaurant Ultimo's.
Only gripe would be the bedrooms got quite warm at night as the aircon was behind the beds on the rear walls so no cool blowing air directly on you.
For this time of year with prices up we found Bhavana Villas good value for money.",Bhavana Private Villas
98,Perfect stay,50,December 2014,"Me and my beautiful girlfriend stayed in this beautiful villa for 6 nights in December..The position of this villa was perfect, it was just a little walk to the main street of seminyak, but at the same time not to close, which meant a nice quiet location. The set up of these villas were very modern and immaculate.the staff were great, they were very polite and went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect, often giving us lifts to places we wanted to go. The breakfast could have been better, but in saying that its only a 5 minute walk to the many nice and cheap restaurants in seminyak.The rooms were made up in the morning, pool cleaned, and of an evening the boys returned to spray the rooms for bugs and mosquitos, which was great as we never had a issue with bugs.also the wi fi reception was great, never had a issue connecting.. we also stayed at ubud for 2 nights which was a disaster. We both wished we had stayed at this great place for the entire trip.",Bhavana Private Villas
99,Nice but only average nice,20,December 2014,"We booked this villa for a two weeks period and we have just completed our first week here.
Firstly the position of the villa is a little far from everything although you can walk but it is about 15-20 minutes to seminyak square. I would have preferred a villa closer to something either shopping/restaurant/square or beach. Overall this group of villas is dated and showing signs of age. Big box tv in the lounge area which shows the age. The staff are nice and ok but the attention to detail just is not there. The bed linen had holes in it in some places. The mosquitos can be bad although they do a half hearted attempt at spraying in the evening. The only problem is they make up the room and leave the door open so mosquitos get in and the air conditioner then had to catch up. Also they spray for mosquitos after 7pm and the mosquitos are already going crazy. The breakfast which is cooked in your villa has got to be pretty much the worst breakfast that I have ever had.The sausages/muchrooms always look like they have been cooked days ago and are cold - go figure they cook in you villa and the breakfast is cold! There is such a lack of attention to details with the breakfast. Making up the room is always a mission. Sometimes well after 2pm and then they come back at after 7pm for a turn down. The reception is very reluctant to use their courtesy car just to drop you off at the square which is only 5 minutes away.
The free Wi-Fi is poor and comes and goes pretty much like the tummy cramps you get when you come to Bali.
We have another week to go so will make the best of it but doubt very much whether we will stay here again.
Even the cleaning of the room sometimes need much to be desired. The phone did not work and had to be repaired but it was covered in dust and had not been wiped clean for a long time.
Summary
The villa we stayed in which was #14 was old with tiles missing in the pool/old tv and the list goes on. We unfortunately made the mistake to book two weeks so we are stuck but you learn everytime you come to bali.
As I write this I have the dreaded BALI BELLY - We have come to bali 7 times and without fail I can write off 2 days of my holiday being ill. The in house dining is average but well priced
Overall I can honestly say this villa is ok but that is all - You would expect just a little more for a $400 to $500 per night villa.",Bhavana Private Villas
100,Great value,40,December 2014,"Stayed here with another couple in a 2 bedroom villa. This is perfect for that, maybe a little to far back to walk with family but we had dcooters. would not stay in a resort again, the staff were amazing and the villa was so private and quiet!
Will be back for sure",Bhavana Private Villas
101,Great location. Villas very private.,30,October 2014,"Bhavana Villas are in a great location, very private and great for couples getting away from the city hype. Getting a little tierd and old - needing a bit of an upgrade Disappointing though that housekeeping is very poor and for that I would not give it a 4 star rating. They need to up their game if they want to compete in the very competitive villa markets in Bali. First morning breakfast OK but when we returned to our villa at 3pm, still all breakfast half eaten food on our outside table and housekeeping where only just starting room. They did a very poor clean of room, benches and tables were not properly wiped, still food smears on table, toothpaste remnants on bathroom bench. No towels ( they are only tiny towels and a little worn). Part of being on holidays is that you don't want to cook, clean or look at mess, that's why you pay the money, $200 per night is not cheap. We smashed a bottle of drink on the Wed afternoon, they cleaned up the glass for us a gave a quick wipe with mop, for the next days there was still big chunk of glass under table and you could see the smears on tiles - so they don't mop or sweep the floors. Engineers came to our room after we left one afternoon to fix lights, when we got back later that afternoon, the villa door wide open and our bedroom door unlocked and open, my husband spoke to front reception he came had a look and said "" you sure you closed them when you went out"" how rude - they were last in the room. No apologies or anything. This is my second stay at this villas but will be the last unfortunately.",Bhavana Private Villas
102,nice quiet and central to shops and restraunts,50,October 2014,"very nice villas and at a good price. We only stayed a few days but it was very quiet and peaceful. The villas have an outside kitchen and a seating area overlooking the private pool. The outside bathroom was very spacious with both a rainwater shower and a large hot shower. Huge bathtub and plenty of bench space with mirror.
The pool was warm enough to swim in and had a nice water feature to it. The staff were lovely and friendly and we had our breakfast made for us in our villa every morning.
It is in walking distance (3 mins) of the busy eat street.
We had free transport arranged by the hotel and they were on time.
I would definitely stay here again.",Bhavana Private Villas
103,Relaxing time with privacy,40,June 2014,"The staff was great
The villa is close to shops but the relaxing time and privacy was what we were looking for and got in spades, our villa was very clean and was cleaned daily if we wished.
We would recommend staying here to anyone and look forward to staying there again.",Bhavana Private Villas
104,Excellent,50,September 2014,"I stayed there with 3 other friends, the staff where so friendly especially Radet he was a real gentlemen and agus was also very vell mannered. Positives it was always clean day in day out, relaxing and fairly cheap for the paradise it was. Negatives: mosquitos at night time which cant really be helped they try there best to put mosquito fragrances around. The rooms where never a problem. I thank them all and I will be recommended it to others and eventually going back! :)",Bhavana Private Villas
105,You can relax,40,September 2014,"Totally great and we could enjoy Bali’s life.
Staffs ware so friendly with good services and once I order something then their action/answer ware delicate. Thank you for your hospitality.
But there were some minor things I’m concerned about.
-Some room lights went out.
-Toilet roll, Beers in mini bar, soap was not replenished during stay.",Bhavana Private Villas
106,What a haven! Book this one!!!,50,July 2014,"We booked a 2Bd Villa for myself/partner and friend which was just perfect, very spacious and private. Could not have been happier from the moment we arrived. Like most in Bali, the staff were just so amazing and pleasant all the time. Rooms were very clean, pool nice temperature, breakfast good selection and quality, rooms service tasty (lunch & dinner). Location is quiet but close to the local strip with some of Bali's best restaurants. This is the place we will go back to.",Bhavana Private Villas
107,A perfect private paradise!,50,September 2014,"We spent 8 days at Bhavana Villas and LOVED it! Right from being picked up from the lovely Mr Bang Bang at the airport. Our Villa looked just like the pics on the website - in fact better! The location was great, just a 5 min walk to Eat Street. The staff were absolutely amazing. They even surprised me with a beautiful cake and bunch of flowers from the team at Bhavana for my birthday! Our breakfast was cooked in our villa each morning by 2 staff and was fantastic! We cannot recommend Bhavana more, and will definitely be returning. Thanks team for making our holiday perfect! Vicki & Francesca.",Bhavana Private Villas
108,Value for money,40,September 2014,"Out the 3 villas we stayed at during our holiday Bhavana was the best value for money. The trip started with a hiccup when the arranged transport through the villa was not at the airport. However another employee from Bhavana Mr Bam-Bang quickly took us under his wing and arranged transport to the villa. The villa's are beautifully appointed and I would mark 7/10. The only downsides or suggestions for the owners are that the bathrooms need upgrading (the outdoor shower head is too low at 5'5"" and a few of the pipes needed fixing). There are no amenities in the bathrooms so pack shampoo etc. I would also suggest an iPod Dock. The breakfast cooked in ur villa is convenient and a nice touch, however the quality of food is average. All in all we loved our stay and Siska is an absolute joy. Thank you to your team :-)",Bhavana Private Villas
109,"Disapointing,",20,September 2014,"We had a group of four (two couples) so booked the two bedroom villa. On arrival to Villa Bhavana our room wasn't available, we were told it would be available in an hour however when my boyfriend returned it was still not available, not a huge issue but the staff at the front desk didn't seem to care at all throughout our stay if there were any concerns voiced. The rooms were clean when we arrived at the villa as were the bathrooms. The outdoor shower does not have hot water and the bath did not have a cold tap, so these couldn't be utilized unfortunately. We had one breakfast in the villa which made us all feel rather unwell and was not cleaned up from the villa until we asked - 5 hours after we had had our breakfast. Rooms were not serviced until approximately 2 in the afternoon. My friends found a blood stain on their mosquito nets and asked them to be changed to which they were told a flat no as there were no other mosquito nets available (we ended up taking the net down to avoid the blood). Unfortunately there are a lot of mosquitos around the villa with very minimal coils or spraying occurring. We inquired about mosquito coils but didn't receive any further information. The villa is run down and not clean feeling, which for the price you pay is unfortunate. I think there are much better options available in Seminyak for the same, or less price.",Bhavana Private Villas
110,Private relaxing villa close to everything.,50,August 2014,Stayed here for 7 nights in Villa 1. It is closest to the office so got great wifi access. Thought it might be noisy but it wasn't. Villa are very spacious and comfortable. Awesome shower and water pressure. Pool very clean. Staff at villa are very friendly and super helpful. Breakfast cooked in your room is a huge meal. It's about 600 mtrs to Main Street in Seminyak and about 15 min walk to beach. Would definately stay here again.,Bhavana Private Villas
111,A good stay ...,30,July 2014,"Travelling with my teenage daughter first time to Bali, had to wait one hour at airport for transfer at night - arrived at villa tired so welcoming fruit and drink wasted on us. Cantik Villas advertised local transport with driver subject to availability - this was never available -i asked several times - and staff on front counter didn't know what I was talking about - breakfasts good - front counter service good - villas could do with refurbishment particularly given the villa rate - waterfall in pool was turned on once in a 10 day stay - dinner room service on both occasions cold and they ran out of wine on one occasion - staff were lovely and overall stay was good.",Bhavana Private Villas
112,Perfect Stay!,50,July 2014,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for a week and we both loved every part of it.

The indoor/outdoor bathroom with two separate showers - outdoor one and indoor one - was beautiful. The towels were changed daily if needed, including big beach towels. We had breakfast almost every day in our villa. The portions were huge and neither of us ever finished everything. We had muesli, omelettes, scrambled eggs, poached eggs etc as well as croissants, juice and coffee - amazing. Great way to start the day of site seeing, massages and more dining out! It was a short walk to our favourite spots like Mexicola and Sisterfields and of course Body Works.

The staff at Bhavana, especially Siska who booked things for us, were extremely helpful and organised all our dinners, day trips and transport. Great help! Nothing was too much trouble for them :)

I would definitely recommend staying at Bhavana Villas - clean, friendly staff, well serviced rooms, and beautiful surroundings made for a most enjoyable stay. We will be back next year!",Bhavana Private Villas
113,Amazing stay,50,May 2014,"Would like to show my appreciation to the excellent staffs who made our vacation filled with joy and happiness. They provide roundtrip airport transportation. Going there our flight was delayed, and the line for custom and immigration was ridiculously long, the staff waited us in the hot outdoor area for 3 hours. But when he sees us he greeted us and helped with luggages, with a smile. Amazing.

The villa itself is great. We enjoyed the daily breakfast prepared in our kitchen followed by a swim. There are plenty of shops and restaurants outside on the main street, and one day we just randomly wondered around the area and came across many artistic stores. The villa is good for both families and couples, I highly recommend it!",Bhavana Private Villas
114,Truly lovely,40,August 2013,"The staff were amazing. We had a lovely stay. Walking distance to restaurants and Main Street of seminyak. To stay price competitive they need to keep rooms updated, not let them get tired and run down. We loved the fresh breaky cooked in our room each morning.",Bhavana Private Villas
115,It's fullfilled my family vacation in Bali,50,June 2014,"It's very good pool villa and very private. We had very big pool in our villa and my grandma also swam, even she hasn't done it for many years. We had very big breakfast (choice), served at our villa and it was very big portion and tasty. The service was very good as well,

The hotel crew came to turn down, and sprayed our room by Bygon. But I would like to suggest that you should not spray the mosquito by Bygon when the people were inside the room. You should use something natural, not chemical. Also, a lot of mosquitoes at the living room, I think the resort should provide the electric mosquito repellent, should be the best one and if possible put some of insect repellent in room.

The location is a bit far from the beach by walking (it's about 15 min), but you can take taxi to the beach by only 5 min. We went to the beach at night time, it's quite dark way.

If we have another chance to go back to Bali again, we will go back to stay here again.",Bhavana Private Villas
116,Love this place but it's not as good as it used to be,40,June 2014,"Have stayed here 4 times now, love the place & it's location but I think it's starting to become a little tired & run down. Although we still enjoyed our time here I think we will choose a different villa next stay, price I feel is a little exy now for its condition. Staff are always very friendly. Road out front is increasingly busy each time we return.",Bhavana Private Villas
117,Less than desirable,10,June 2014,"This villa is not value for its money. Yes although friendly staff which is Bali as a whole the entire 5 night experience was terrible. I never write reviews but did not want anyone to share this same experience. Everything in the room was breaking. Rusty showers, towels not replaced. Eaten alive by Mosquitos in the middle of the night. Room service food is terrible. Wifi cuts in and out. Villa hardly gets any sun so forget it if u want to tan. Fridge is not even cold. Ordered bin tangs and served warm. Positive- friendly staff!",Bhavana Private Villas
118,"Great value, very friendly staff. Highly recommended.",50,May 2014,"I just spent a very relaxing 14 nights at Bhavana Villas and I left with a tear in my eye. The staff are very friendly and helpful! A big thank you Mr Bang ban and Sisca especially.
The location of the villas is close to main strip of Seminyak but not too close as to hear traffic or loud music from surrounding bars, is a very easy 2-4 min walk to restaurants and approx 10 mins stroll to the beach and Ku DeTa.
The villa itself was very comfortable and I had everything in it I was promised, good air conditioning, cold fridge, gas hot plates, kitchen appliances and cutlery etc..the pool was clean and had ample sunshine, the bathroom was more than satisfactory, with indoor and outdoor showers, large bath tub and nice feature lighting.
The staff would do daily cleans, turn down the bed at night, light mosquito coils and supply insect repellent(not that the mossies were bad, just was nice to be protected).
Summary: you won't be disappointed if you stay here, is very good value and I will definitely be coming back to stay at this very nice villa.. just not soon enough!..",Bhavana Private Villas
119,Not as good as expected,30,May 2014,"Stayed here for 8 nights.
Positives - friendly staff, good location, close to Eat St, 10 minutes to the beach, quiet, safe. The outdoor bathroom with rainforest shower was lovely, the beds were comfortable and the air con good. Pool was refreshing.
Negatives - not as spacious as in the picture. The towels were not replaced until we asked. The amenities such as tea and sugar not replenished regularly. The fridge had no shelves except the top of the veggie bin, no door on the freezer section and the door seal was deteriorating and didn't close completely. The most negative aspect was the breakfast which was cold and unappealing. Only the eggs and toast are cooked in your villa, things like bacon and hash browns are brought to the villa pre cooked. We chose to go out to eat after two breakfasts. We had the in-room dining once and it was truly dreadful.
I have stayed in many places in Bali that I would go to again but I wouldn't stay at the villas again as they are not value for money.",Bhavana Private Villas
120,Lovely Pool villas,40,May 2014,"We just returned from a 8 night stay here.

We were pretty happy with the Bhavana Villas. The location is back away from it all, but with a little one (10mths) we weren't too fussed about being near the beach. It was only a 3-5 minute walk to Oberoi Street which had plenty of restaurants to choose from.

We had a 2 bedroom villa and were happy with it. The staff were only too happy to put a fence around the pool to stop our boy going in. They would clean the rooms around his sleeping pattern so they were great in that regard. The staff were all very friendly and would greet you at every opportunity.

The beds were quite comfortable and very large. They did a turn down service in the evening and sprayed for mosquitoes which were a problem at times (welcome to Bali!). The A/C was excellent and I liked the outdoor shower next to the closed one. The Pool was nice and cold and very refreshing which is just what we wanted. I must have swum about 3-4 times every day.

Only disappointment was the breakfast for mine. It was pretty cool that they did come and cook it in your villa, but it was just average. We had it the first few days but then found a little hidden gem (Revolver) which had a great breakfast and just ate there for the last 5 nights.

Otherwise we enjoyed the Villas and would happily recommend them to any families staying here.",Bhavana Private Villas
121,Incredible!,50,May 2014,"It's amazing to drive down the tiny (but long) streets and know that this place is tucked away. My first time being to Bali I wanted somewhere I felt safe and private, this place blew me away and we recommend it to anyone considering staying at Bhavana. Everything was clean and tidy, breakfast was made in front of our eyes and the pool was perfect temperature. Great experience, cant wait to visit again! Pictures were taken with a GoPro.",Bhavana Private Villas
122,Really amazing villas!,50,April 2014,"When we booked our accommodation here, we were praying that our villa promised the luxury that we saw in the photographs on the website.....and it did not disappoint. The room was beautifully decorated in traditional Balinese furniture, the pool was superb, the bathroom was incredible and the bedroom made me feel like I was a princess with the four poster bed and mossie net! We found the staff to be incredibly friendly, they couldn't do more to help out and they spoke very good English. Our breakfast was prepared each morning and was delicious, and a HUGE variety of options to choose from. Be warned, if you aren't sure what a ""villa"" entails in Bali, I think it means basically outdoor living. So EVERYTHING, aside from the bedroom, is open to the elements. We weren't aware of this (maybe I am a bit dumb?) and it was surprise when we got there, but the mossies were warded off by our Aerogaurd roll on and we found the skinks chasing each other across the walls rather entertaining. I imagine this may not be everybody's cup of tea so just something to be aware of. Anyone who complains about leaves dropping on the floor and in the pool, needs to remember they are outdoor living, so these things are to be expected. I found it really lovely how all the frangipani flowers had fallen from the trees and littered the wooden walkways. Circle K (small dairy/shop) is a 5 minute walk away for milk and the likes, Seminyak Square and the beach a 10 minute walk. Great location. We booked the white water rafting and a tour guide, they had no problem finding us to pick us up. Villa organised our pick up and drop off at the airport. We ordered food to our room at night - great value and big meals. And we even had a massage in the privacy of our own villa - lovely, and again, good value. It was so much more than what we expected and we will definitely be back! (Yes, there is a building site a few doors down but the noise is unnoticeable - aside from the odd shout, we didn't hear a thing).",Bhavana Private Villas
123,Absolutely amazing,50,April 2014,Stayed here for only 3 nights but was amazed by the beautiful villa. The staff are friendly and our villa always clean. We had rose petals and candles set up on the pool one night for $50 and it was just stunning. We booked the free breakfast every morning and they come to your room and cook whatever you like it was always delicious. I give this place 10 out of 10. We will be going back.,Bhavana Private Villas
124,Mixed feelings,30,November 2013,"We stayed here in November with our 2 children. The resort itself is very well presented and very clean. We had 2 children aged 6 and 7 so not very ideal for us to walk along the alley to the restaurants every night but if you were to get a cab or scooter it would be fine. We stayed in villa 1 and had issues with our pool, the staff were great trying to sort the problem straight away. The outside of the villa was a little tired but the beds very comfortable the air conditioning worked very well. In my opinion not a very good spot for young families but this is no reflection on the resort.",Bhavana Private Villas
125,stunning!,50,September 2013,"My boyfriend and i stayed here in Sep 2013, as soon as we got to our villa it was completely breath taking, i have read some so so reviews on the breakfast, i thought it was great, they come into your villa and cook for you! room service is amazing, at 11pm we got take out and they came in to set our table, pour our drinks, the service was second to none! these guys really go above and beyond what you would expect. we were so happy with our stay (5 nights) and left for Nusa Dua....which was a big mistake!",Bhavana Private Villas
126,Read before booking 2014 construction works,20,March 2014,"Great location, good villa if you pay rate iv. $170 pn for 1 bed villa otherwise mmmmmm, breakfast is awful if you can book without great buy own cooking facilities there. BE AWARE new construction site next door (raywhite ) from Oct 2014 onwards, this was a great villa otherwise, staff are great",Bhavana Private Villas
127,Beyond my expectations,40,February 2014,"I decided to have a weekend gateaway for valentine's day with my bf at the last minute. My choice goes to Bhavana for the reasonable price and its location. I didn't have a lot of expectations due to the so-so reviews and I was wrong! I am totally happy and satisfied to stayed there. I booked one bedroom villa but they've upgraded our room to 2 bedrooms villa.The staff are very helpful and friendly, the villa is very spacey, they even decorated the bed and bathtub with rose petals.

The only minus.. you can hear people voices from the villa next to you if you get the villa in the middle. For me, it doesn't bother me much. I suggest you ask for the room in the corner if you want more quiet surroundings.

If you're looking for villas that is very close to the beach maybe this is not the one. If you're looking for comfortable and nice accommodation close to seminyak street then this is the one.",Bhavana Private Villas
128,Delighted by the warm & friendly atmosphere,50,December 2013,"Picked up at the Airport and checked into our Villa (11) one bedroom.

Chose to go in the ""wet"" season so we had our fair share of rain, which was on and off during the day, no problem with the umbrellas supplied in our room.

The Villa was large, clean and comfortable with adequate air conditioning/fans and the private pool a real treat.

The staff were fantastic, friendly and always smiled, with breakfast cooked in our Villa daily,",Bhavana Private Villas
129,Worst Choice,10,December 2013,"I was recently on holiday in Bali and had pre reserved accommodation in Bhavana Villa's. Judging by the pictures annd reviews, the villas seem great, however, upon arrival, we were sent to our two bedroom villa and were appalled at the terrible condition of the place. the semi outdoor lounge was dirty and old. the bathrooms were dirty and filled with leaves. the shower was coated with grime. the bedding had a very unpleasant odour and was stained, it was impossible to sleep with the permanent stench from the pillows. the breakfast tasted terrible. the dishes in the villa were in a terrible state. After one night at the villa we resorted to moving to the W hotel which was great. we are still awaiting news on a refund. overall, these villas were the worst accommodation we've ever booked. The villas are said to be 1km away from the beach and in close proximity to restaurants etc, however its necessary to take a shuttle to these.",Bhavana Private Villas
130,Didn't want to leave,50,December 2013,"Absolutely loved Bhavana Villas. From the moment we were picked up at the airport we were made to feel very welcome. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they were always eager to please. A special mention to Bang Bang who looked after us superbly. He greeted us at the airport and drove us to the villas. He organised trips for us and answered any questions we had during our stay. He is such an asset to the villas and really helped to set the tone of our wonderful stay.
We had a 1 bedroom villa and it was huge. The bed was super comfy and the air conditioning in the bedroom was a god send. Each night the staff came in and closed the mosquito net around the king size four poster bed and we felt like movie stars sleeping in it. They lit mosquito coils in the bedroom and out by the pool and outdoor living area. We had no problem with mosquitos at all. We slept soundly each night. The outdoor bathroom is very luxurious.
The kitchen and lounge are both outdoor too and overlook the private pool and sundeck. The pool and the gardens in our villa were amazing and so beautiful. It was such a treat to be able to be able to jump into our private pool any time day or night. No one else can see you so did the occasional swim without the bathers. We found we couldn't wait to get back to the villa after exploring or walking around and getting hot and bothered to get in the pool and cool off.
We could even watch TV and listen to music while floating around in the pool. The stereo had an ipod connector which was great. There is another TV in the bedroom with a DVD player.
My favourite thing to do during my stay was to go for a swim in the morning to wake up just before the butler arrived to cook our breakfast in the villa. Certainly wakes you up. The breakfast was delicious and we felt so spoilt having the butler cook it for us right in our own villa. The food was fresh and it's cooked right in front of you while you wait. It takes them about 15 minutes to cook it so I would have a shower after my swim and then it was ready and waiting. I thought the breakfast selections were great. You could have American breakfast, Continental, Eggs Benedict, Pancakes and Traditional Indonesian one which we didn't try. All came with juice, tea or coffee, fresh fruit, toast and pastries.
The room also came with an international electricity power point adaptor which was a nice touch. I brought one with me but needn't have bothered. Meant my partner and I could charge our devices at the same time.
We stayed here for 2 lots of 2 nights (We did a 2 night trip to Gili Trewangan in the middle of our stay). So we got to experience 2 different villas (14 & 16). They were basically the same but the gardens were slightly different in each however both were just as beautiful as each other. The lighting in the pool area and garden at night was also lovely.
I've just arrived back at home and missing my pool. If I go back to Bali I will definitely stay here again. I was blown away by this place and can't fault it at all.",Bhavana Private Villas
131,Comfortable clean villa,40,October 2013,"Currently staying here for 12 day stay. Lovely clean villa, off gang in Oberoi street, alongside Ultimo. Vila tastefully decorated, nice pool and great breakfast and good service. Staff lovely, any problems have been rectified immediately. Would I stay here again? Most definatly, location great and villa 4 star.",Bhavana Private Villas
132,"Exceptional service, so helpful!",40,October 2013,"Bhavana Private Villa is not the most modern or new place we've stayed in but very clean and tidy.

It was our first time in Bali and first time I did a lot of activities. There was a young girl at reception, EVERY day we asked her to book us activities and restaurants (we stayed there 3 nights). Activities in the morning on all days, lunch and dinner reservations as well. She did not have an issue with any of this. She had booked us EVERYTHING we had asked. We didn't get her name but if you do ever meet her, you'll know that it's her. Everything we asked, she'd reply ""certainly or certainly sir"". Such lovely services overall.

One disappointing thing about Bhavana was, breakfast and room service was not edible. Food tasted artificial. Could not eat or drink anything. We both ended up skipping breakfast. But good effort for coming into our villa every morning and cooking it for us.

We asked them to clean our pool and it was clean before you know it. They were quick to attend to us.

We ask for restaurant recommendations and staff had recommended a seafood restaurant in Jimbaran. Dewata Cafe was exceptional. The locals know what's going on. Shabby looking place but food was amazingly fresh.
Best service we have had in Bali. I'll really miss that from Bhavana. No one else in Bali has been this helpful.",Bhavana Private Villas
133,We will be back!,50,September 2013,"My girlfriend and I stayed in the Bhavana Villas from the 3rd to 10th September and have run out of superlatives for the place, in particular the truly world class service the staff give you from the moment you arrive.

Our one bedroom villa (no 4) was beautifully presented with a private pool and gorgeous traditional Balinese furniture. In particular we liked the semi - outdoor living and kitchen area and the bathroom to rear of the villa, complete with sunken bath and outdoor shower. The four poster bed was comfy and the hotel staff offer a turn-down service every night whereby they flick the lights on, open out the mosquito net around the bed and lay mosquito repellant down. The swimming pool was cleaned every day, and was bliss after a long day in the humidity or for waking up in the morning.

The breakfast crew were great, they come into your villa and cook whatever you want - another perk you won't get at a regular hotel. The room was cleaned daily with spotless efficiency, to the point that our clothes were being folded up for us. They made such an effort for us, and we can't thank them enough - my girlfriend was feeling sick and they sent round a lovely bunch of flowers free of charge to perk her up!

The food was reasonable, the massages good.

I've read reviews on here that have complaints about various aspects like unclean pools etc, but sometimes things like that happen. Don't be put off by the haters, this really is a fantastic place to stay, and we can't wait to come back. Thank you Bhavana! Ben & Melody. X",Bhavana Private Villas
134,Good place,40,August 2013,"Room is good, and they clean well, the problem only have plant and tree inside so sometimes they make dirty by they own.near to the street and easy to explore seminyak from there if u like to walk.
Its nice if u couple coz the villa really give ure own privacy.
Have own chef everymorning
Service good.
The only problem when we check out early morning around 5 they dont give us car n driver to airport, so we have to use taxi",Bhavana Private Villas
135,Never again,10,August 2013,"We stayed in the bhavana villas from the 16th to 24th August. We had a driver collect us from the airport who was lovely. We were welcomed at the villa by a lovely receptionist he was very nice. Our villa was lovely (2 bed room) rooms were nice and clean. We were very happy until , after 5days our pool went green the staff came and put chlorine in two day in a row and it just seen to make it worse. The staff laughed it off saying ""the pool is sick"" we didn't find it very funny as we were paying $3000 for 8 nights. So for a finish we had a green pool for our last 3 days and could not use it.

Then we had a little visitor for the last 2 days a RAT , again went to reception they placed rat poison and traps and told us were in Bali so we had to expect it they did not to frequent checks or anything. Not very impressed!!!!!

I would recommend to get the spa treatments out of the villa , the same oils and everything was used even if you got different massages. We got the petal bath ( which was a lovely treat) but its not the set up in pictures with oils and candles its literally petals.

The food wasn't good , they don't have cooking facility's on the premises they order your food from another restaurant and by the time in comes to you it's cold and hard.

On our last night we requested a manager to speak to about the pool trouble and the rat.
They sent a supervisor she did noting for us just didn't see our point of disappointment , we then asked for a Manager we were told 1st she was not in Bail, then she was in Jakarta , by the end of the night 6 hours later she was coming to the villa to us as we asked. The supervisor was the rudest person I possibly met she even went to the extent of taking all of our paper work , our file with all details sense the day we booked the villa home with her after her shift. I would guess this is illegal as everything is in my name!! The reason she gave me for taking it home was because she didn't trust her staff!!! Mind you she left the $3000 in the safe.

She left the villa and left the receptionist to do her dirty work
For a finish the Manager NEVER came to the villa to sort this mess out

We spoke to the manager over the phone she told us there is noting she can do for us as HER STAFF ARE HER PRIORITY NOT HER GUESTS!!!!! We couldn't believe what we were hearing.

I never experienced anything like this so unprofessional, we just experienced problems and lies especially from the supervisor and manager. I would never return to this villa and I would not recommend it to any one you can get a lot better and top quality service for $3000 Bali.
I am looking forward to the reply from the manager.",Bhavana Private Villas
136,Had a great stay,40,August 2013,"We stayed in Villa 6 and were very happy. The pool was only just lean enough and also a bit cold, but nice after a busy day. The bedroom was a dream. The bathroom was amazing. Very big with lots of hot water. The staff a very friendly and nothing was any trouble. Would recommend to anyone.",Bhavana Private Villas
137,Fantastic Honeymoon!,50,July 2013,"What a place! Bhavana started off great with a free airport transfer. When we landed in Bali, the driver was waiting for us. He was incredibly friendly and personable. When we were driving to the villas, it was a bit sketchy since it is off the main road and looks like you are in the middle of nowhere at first. When we pulled in and walked into the reception, we were already impressed. A beautiful open air reception and incredibly friendly staff. While we completed the registration, they brought us a welcome drink and took our luggage into the room.
When we were taken to the room they had turned down the room (it was 9pm). The pool was lit and very pretty. It was a bit dirty, but it had rained that day so it looked like debris. We asked them to clean it and it was cleaned the next day while we were out. The only problem was that the pool was pretty cold so we didn't go in it too often. The open air living area was perfect to hang out in and they had lit mosquito coils that worked surprisingly well. The bedroom was perfect! High peaked ceilings and the bed had a mosquito net around it. The bathroom was a dream. I loved being able to shower and look at the stars or the puffy white clouds.
During the week, we were in and out of the place. I'm pretty sure they watched when we left and came in and only 1 day we ran into the cleaning service. They did a wonderful job. All the little things were taken care of such as refilling the shower gel in the clay pot.
Breakfast was good, but got a bit boring towards the end of our stay as the menu is a bit limited. However, they don't have a restaurant and it is understandable to not have a ton of choices. They come in and cook your breakfast and it was great! Room service is available 24 hours a day and the menu is extensive and everything we got was good.
The location was also perfect for us. It was just a 5-10 minute walk to the main strip and 15-20 minutes from the beach. There were also a bunch of little restaurants and bars on the way to the main strip so whatever you wanted was very accessible.
The day we left, they brought us to the airport and on the way we asked to stop at the store. The gentleman driving us said absolutely and had no problem. When we got to the airport as well he dropped us off in the ""VIP"" section, which meant we didn't have to walk far to check in. We had a lot of luggage so that was perfect as well.
The one thing that the hotel should tell people when they are leaving is to make sure they have 150,000 rupiah per person as an airport fee. The girl told me when we were checking out because I said I wanted to use the cash that I had left and it reminded her to tell me about the 150,000. However, it's per person, so I ended up having to take out more money for my husband. I know its not the hotel's responsibility, but I think it would be something useful for people to know and a nice little touch!
All in all we were just so impressed with the service. Anything we asked for they attended to promptly and was always resolved.
Such a great place and a great honeymoon. I would most certainly recommend it!",Bhavana Private Villas
138,LOVED OUR HOME AWAY FROM HOME!!!,50,July 2013,"I would like to say thank you to the wonderful staff at Bhavana! You all made my special trip even more special!! The villa is just as I hopped from the pictures, and the location was perfect! We all loved the pool and we were in it at least 2 times a day! We are a family of 4 2 adults and 2 kids 9 and 14. The 2 separate rooms really allow the adults to have a vacation wile being there with the family! I would recommend this villa to anyone looking for a great home and location for your trip to BALI!!",Bhavana Private Villas
139,give it a miss,20,March 2013,"We were in the last villa on the left at the end of the pathway, and it was a shocker.
As we entered , a young guy said he was fixing the pool filter , he then left without fixing it.
We then checked the place out, pool was dirty with slime and debris obviously the filter had not been working for some time.Cigarette butts in garden and outdoor bathroom as well as in the water feature that had no water in it. outdoor fan did not work,after a call a guy rewired it and it worked on one speed none stop. the mozzy net over the bed was full of dust and had bird droppings on it, and the place was grubby and tired.We stayed one night and decided our holiday is to short to waste time somewhere this bad. We left and went to kunja villas around a few corners (fantastic check it out) A refund was offered but not received . SURPRISE..SURPRISE. staff were friendly enough, the place is old and i think the photo's must have been taken a long time ago or photo shopped. Some reviews seem a bit fishy!!. So many good villas around, GIVE THIS ONE A MISS!!!!!",Bhavana Private Villas
140,Home away from home,50,May 2013,"We just returned home from an amazing trip to Seminyak, staying at Bhavana. I confess after reading the reviews after booking, I was a little nervous as to what we'd upon arrival. All I can say is that we were blown away!!! We had booked a 7 night trip to Bali and loved it so much we extended our stay. Our Villa was a huge part of that decision. We absolutely loved it!!! We got a great deal for our stay. The pool was sensational after a long, hot, sticky day of exploring. The bed was sooo comfy and the outdoor living room perfect for the two of us. Most importantly, the staff... They were amazing! So accommodating, so friendly, so helpful! They became a little like family, which I'm sure they'll become when we return, which we most certainly will! Yes, the ""bumpy road"" needs work but it was graded (which we didn't hear!) during our stay which is evidence that management are onto the problem. The location is fantastic, close to Eat St but quiet and tranquil. I could rave all day about Bhavana Private Villas! loved it, loved it! Loved it!!! We will be back! Suksema so very much to all the staff who looked after us during our stay! X",Bhavana Private Villas
141,Decent villa,40,May 2013,"The whole experience for this villa is made fabulous by the service staff...they are nice locals whom are friendly and have the willing to help attitude.... whenever I request for anything, they would do it almost instantly wothout much delay...their efficiency impresses me as I work in service line similar to theirs...I know what's a prompt reponse when I see one....very decent and helpful bunch...will definitely go back again...",Bhavana Private Villas
142,Horrible experience !!!,10,April 2013,Old hotel badly maintained. I was electrocuted by my bedside lamp and there was no security system (miliampere meter) to stop the current.The handle of my room was broken nobody repeared it during the three long and bad days I spent in this villa. The steps of the swimming pool were so slippery because nobody clean them that my mother couldn't take a bath during all our stay. The road to arrive at the hotel was impraticable and full off potholes. Fortunately the staff was nice. The last day the manager came to see us and was so sorry for all these bad events thank you miss but it's not enough!!!! we payed 1042 australian dollars for this two bedrooms villa (expansive for this period in Bali),Bhavana Private Villas
143,Great staff but tired villa,30,April 2013,"Firstly, the staff are so helpful, happy and try to accomodate your every need. Everything you ask for...in Bali time...they try to achieve. Even when we all got sick, they kindly delivered litres of guava juice for the kids which is meant to help them!!
We booked the villa off Agoda- the pictures looked fantastic but on closer examination, the villa is old and tired, the pool was a good size but the tiles were cracked and there was often green mould on the tiles making them very slippery. We had to ask for the filter to run longer and for them to check the chemical levels, which they did.The bedrooms and bathrooms are big, the lounge area didn't really work as well as other villas as there were only 2 small wooden couches for 4 people. There is only room for 2 sun lounges which is hard for 4 people.The mosquitoes were pretty bad at 5pm onwards...they came to ""defog"" the rooms at about 6:30. The road out the front is really bad so it's hard to get a taxi....we usually walked to JL Oberoi which was ok and the Great location to the restaurant stripmade it bearable. Breakfasts are big, and quite a few choices although they use cordial ""juice"", the powdered kind I think. The staff again are so courteous and caring so it makes up for alot of the lack of attention to detail. Sounding picky, things like no facecloths or tea towels in the kitchen, not replacing tea etc daily, all small things but at $280/night(discounted) we have had better value in the past. As a family villa it was ok but I'd probably not go back as we have paid $200/night for better elsewhere.
Again this does not reflect on the staff who were all fabulous.",Bhavana Private Villas
144,"Villa looking tired, not clean, pool unusable",30,March 2013,"Spent four nights in a one bedroom villa, no.2. Returning here after having stayed in a two bedroom with friends in 2009. We loved the villas back then, however on this visit the villas are looking very tired, not very clean and generally worn out. The pool was unusable, water cloudy, green slime on tiles, grout and entry step. It looked as though it had not been vacuumed for some time. The water feature wall was all green and slimy too. We reported this to reception with no action taken, they told us it was from rain?? The pool needed to be shocked and thoroughly cleaned. We felt the villa was overpriced for its standard. There are so many new villas in seminyak with great rates, I would recommend looking elsewhere. Also the road to the villas becomes dirt with huge pot holes, to the point that taxis bottom out. It was a shame, we were really disappointed.",Bhavana Private Villas
145,Good from afar....,30,February 2013,"We have been staying in one bedroom of a two bedroom villa, as they oversold the one bedrooms. Nice looking property in a dodgy looking part of Seminyak. Initially we were impressed, but after a few nights I would suggest there are better deals to be had.
The villa has a private plunge pool which is lovely to sit by, but it has some leaks and tiling falling off, which make it look tired. There is a cathode ray TV in the open air living room, which is not an antique yet, but will soon be and beside it is the CD/DVD/tape player of similar vintage, although it won't play dvd's.
In the bedroom is a lovely king size bed with canopy mosquito net and A/C that makes a bit of a difference, but struggles for the size of the room. There is a flat screen TV hooked up to another DVD player (that doesn't work). We reported the DVD player, which they got going, but has no sound and sounds like a helicopter taking off.
The staff are friendly, but, the few things we requested took hours or days to be provided. The bed for our child was not present and there was some debate if we had nominated she was with us until I suggested they check the booking, then after the tooing and froeing about 3 hours later the bed turned up, with our daughter fast asleep in our bed for the night. Etc.etc... it just went on like this really, but at least the staff were always smiling.
Trust me, you can do better with your money than this property. Good luck.",Bhavana Private Villas
146,Over priced.... Not clean. Staff not that friendly.,20,January 2013,"We spent three nights here in a one bedroom villa. The staff were not that nice when compared to other hotels around the area of Seminyak and other locations in Bali including Legian and Nusa Dua.

The room was not clean at all. There was cigarette butts upon returning to the hotel after the cleaners had been into the room. They also left egg shells from a breakfast cooked in the villa when another person was staying there. The pool was not that clean, nor the kitchen. After they cooked breakfast, it was not cleaned. After the cleaners had been in, the kitchen was still not clean. After advising them of the egg shells and cigarette butts, they only cleaned the cigarette butts. For our whole stay, the egg shells remained even after advising them a few times.

The air conditioner broke down during the middle of the night twice. We had to call the reception and waited almost an hour each time for one of their staff to get a ladder, clean the filter with a screw driver, unplug the unit and then plug it back in to get it working.

The place is quite run down compared to the photos posted on their website and other various accommodation websites. I definitely wouldn't stay there again.",Bhavana Private Villas
147,Wonderful Getaway!,50,February 2012,"The best villa I have ever been to! beautiful and perfect. There's nothing I do not like about this hotel. Will definitely choose this place again on my next trip to Bali!
Private pool villa is huge and spacious. Breakfast are cooked by chefs that come to your room and prepare it.",Bhavana Private Villas
148,Bhavana Villas,40,December 2012,"Lovely week .... quiet, clean, beautiful villas close to the action of Seminyak. I found the Bhavana villas excellent. From the moment I was met at the airport service was friendly and professional. The villa was comfortable, a piece of private heaven. Staff were great, cooking breakfast each morning, smiling and chatting with us. Fresh fruits, range of breakfast choices from western style to Indonesian, food was good and plentiful. Housekeeping staff were fabulous coming in twice a day to clean and turn down the beds at night, lighting the candles and incense burner.
Lovely ambience in the villa, pebble path garden around the pool, fabulous bath and shower....loved lying in bed watching the waterfall into the pool. Beautiful koi pond around reception - look for the turtle swimming with the fish.
Staff were very helpful day and night for anything we needed. I'll be back.",Bhavana Private Villas
149,Bali beauty,50,November 2012,"We spent 4 nights in a 2 bedroom villa and should have done 10!! The villas are huge and the pool was almost too big (just kidding). Lovely decor, Excellent bathroom..shower etc. They come and cook breakfast in the villa and that was a highlight of the morning...nice and fresh and hot.
The staff were very helpful in every way. The bed was king size..No shortage of water available.
5 Min walk to shops and restaurants(we tried 2 and were very impressed...great food and good price) even in villa dining the food was good. All the usual suspects..TV cable WiFi minibar. place is nice and clean. We had a late checkout for nominal price and were able to stay till 6.00pm and relax on our final day. Would definately go back there again.",Bhavana Private Villas
150,Heaven,50,October 2012,We were so happy at Bhavana- we didn't want to leave. It was very quiet and we rarely even saw other guests. Once we were through our wooden carved door we were in our own little world. House keeping were invisible- they came in twice a day and I swear they were keeping tabs on us so to go in when we were out because they were rarely seen! Breakfast was cooked for us every morning and it was always good. The pool was perfect with enough sun to tan or a nice outdoor area with couches and shade. The outdoor bathroom was spacious and clean and we did not have any issues with bugs or anything. The resort is on a quiet little back street but is only a very short walk to the main street in seminyak. I have been to Bali 5 times now and this place is by far my favorite. We will definitely be back. Thanks to all the staff for making it so perfect x,Bhavana Private Villas
151,"Peaceful, idyllic Bhavana",40,November 2012,"After looking online at a number of properties in and around Seminyak, the Bhavana villas seemed to tick all the boxes - Spacious, private, own pool in each villa, good location, and value for money....and it didn't disappoint on any front. In fact, when you add the helpful and friendly service of the staff then the Bhavana exceeded our expectations.

We highly recommend it!!",Bhavana Private Villas
152,Just what we needed,50,November 2012,"We stayed here after a long week of travelling around Bali. It was a great move because we wanted a place to rest. Bhavana was peaceful and private and we were able to relax.
The villa was clean and equipped for all of our needs. The staff were friendly and accommodating. I ordered a massage from the broad menu and it was just wonderful! I felt more comfotable in the villa space than in an actual spa. (I actually went straight to bed after it and slept like a baby!)
Bhavana is located close to the main street however to get to the main street you have to walk down a very dark road. My sister and I felt a bit uneasy late at night.
Also, we ordered room service food which was slightly cold and the plates remained outside on the table until the next day, which attracted birds and flies.

Over all it's a wonderful sanctuary, the local beach is a lot quieter than Kuta and Legian they just need to improve the food service and lighting along the road.",Bhavana Private Villas
153,"Fabulous, just loved this place",50,October 2012,"From our arrival (very early check in) to our departure the Bhavana Private Villas were amazing. The staff were all so friendly and helpful, they all made our holiday so special. It was our anniversary so they decorated the bed with a love heart and the bath was full of rose petals, very nice gesture. The villas are just amazing (they do need a little bit of maintenance done and the bath towels are in need of replacement, especially for this star rating but this is our only negative. They seemed to be doing a little bit of maintenance so am sure they have commenced the works). The bed was massive and so comfortable. We just had the best sleep every night. The outdoor bathroom is fabulous. The villas have everything you possibly need. The pool was great, everything about these villas is amazing. Just a 5 minute walk and you are in the heart of Seminyak with great shops and restaurants. Having our breakfast cooked in our villa every morning by the lovely staff was excellent. I would highly recommend these villas to anyone going to Bali. Ask for Alit (hope I spelt his name correctly) he is the driver for the hotel and was fantastic. Alit, you are a lovely person, a great driver and I hope Bhavana appreciate how good you are at your job. Stay at these villas, they are just fabulous. Thank you for making our stay in Bali so special. We will definitely be back to stay at your beautiful villas.",Bhavana Private Villas
154,Bhavana Privat Villas,40,October 2012,"Great location, walking distance to the best shops, restaurants and beach in Seminyak. Rooms are tidy and spacious, with beautiful covered outdoor bathrooms and living area. Private pools are large and perfect for quick dip.",Bhavana Private Villas
155,"Beautiful villa, great location",40,October 2012,"The staff were super helpful and friendly from the moment we were collected from the airport. Our villa was beautiful with a large bedroom and serene garden to look out into. The location is really central to all the great restaurants & shops in seminyak, but the villa itself is quiet and peaceful. This is the second time we have stated here. We came back bcos it is the best breakfast we had ever had. Unfortunately the menu has changed but it is still comparable to other villas. Would recommend a stay here.",Bhavana Private Villas
156,its dirty,20,September 2012,"hallo guests,

we stayed 3 nights in bhavana villas the villa was ok, but the bed was awful ... When we arrived we thought wow! beautiful hotel ... especially for the price. but when we did the sheets aside, we saw dirty stains ... blood stains and so far I'll save the details ... fleas bah! never in my life anymore..",Bhavana Private Villas
157,Bali sept 2012,30,September 2012,"On a late arrival wow! Great airport pick up by driver Alit who spoke great english and very knowledgable, staff brilliant, villa looked fantastic! Alit is also a driver for hire for the day- he was unavailable but recommended a friend Wayan who was great
For the next 3 days and night the same standard continued! Then disappointing for next 3 days - toilet broke, no water in shower, ""maintenance issues in kitchen "" in fact small maintenance issues everywhere does it sound like a carry on movie??? Staff did their absolute best in trying circumstances. Luckily close to restaurants and shops in seminyak. It is a bit of pot luck with very helpful staff on reception with varying degrees of English. Ulin spa just 5 minute walk is fantastic day spa. Only a minor complaint but to say the pool was refreshing is an understatement. To finish on a positive food and bar prices very reasonable even though villa over priced. ( food and massage prices cheaper than in seminyak) weather was absolutely beautiful everyday as I've been told it always is! Restaurant recommend Rumours (just a short walk down the street) kitchen club seemed good to us although never full at night only busy during day, Potato Head Club is a great venue for a day and to see sunset get there early to get agood daybed! Minimum spend on daybed is 500 000 rupiah but easy to do! Great leather shop in legian is dolphin leather for jackets, suits, bags, shoes (men's and ladies) dolphin leather. Address is Sahadawa St between melatstiand Palma street. Not a place to barter (not cheap) but quality is fantastic, tailor made leather jkt takes 4days and costs $180 AUD approx depending on style and leather. The free shuttle bus around seminyak is hit or miss driver seems to always be taking the boss to Nusa dua or ""just gone out"" Legian is to far for shuttle bus a distance of maybe 3 Kim's. Down the road to the right of the villa is a fantastic little coffe shop called at d'boat house coffee shop. Great tasting food and cheap , friendly and very helpful. Dinner at La Lucciola is beautiful get there for a beautiful sunset",Bhavana Private Villas
158,Great find!,50,September 2012,Love the place. Friendly staff and service. Look forward to coming back here. The private pool is such luxury.Having breakfast cooked fresh in our villa was so special too. The ambiance at night was magical. Definitely recommended.,Bhavana Private Villas
159,Not worth the price...,20,August 2012,"It is tottally my mistakes not to read a review from trip advisor before checking in...
The villa itself i must say not too bad.... The interior and design, the pool they are nice...
But some several things need to improve :
1. The breakfast is faaaar from nice. Its like a breakfast in a cheap motel, sorry just being honest...
2. The bathroom itself is nice, but clearly you have to fix the water problem seriously, its not nice it keep on and off all the time, the shower is not enjoyable at all
3. The pool is smell bad, like the chemical smell but it is even harder than the public pool....
4. When we checking in, the pillows outside, on the sofa, they have black spot on it and really really smell bad... I have no idea how when the last time they wash it....
The review above is based on a 2 bedrooms villa.
Will i come back to this villa or recoommend? For the price, i don't think so :(",Bhavana Private Villas
160,"Relaxing villas, excellent location",50,August 2012,"We stayed for 4 nights in these large villas with beautiful pool and outdoor bathrooms. Polite friendly staff that come and cook breakfast in your villa each morning. Comfy bed and great shower. They could get some new towels though, they are a bit tired looking. Great location within walking distance to Laksmana street to plenty of restaurants and shops. At corner of Laksmana is Ultimo restaurant, great food at reasonable prices. You must also try Metis and Sarong restaurants! Return airport shuttle is great.",Bhavana Private Villas
161,Beautiful private villa,40,August 2012,"We stayed here for 3 nights. We enjoyed our stay here. Very friendly staff that worked hard to accomodate their guests. The breakfast and banana pancakes were delicious. The shuttle service was nice to get us to seminyak square. Close walk to restaurants, shops, and spas.",Bhavana Private Villas
162,Extremely disappointed,10,July 2012,We have just returned from a 2 week stay at these villas and were extremely disappointed.The first villa had a warning alarm for the hot water system which went off during the night several times .The only way to stop this was by leaving a tap running all night.This went on for 2 nights.The second villa we were moved to had a power problem.Every time the pool lights came on the power tripped.The third and final villa had a rat living under the kitchen fridge and was not caught before we left.The condition of the villas was terrible with broken furniture and threadbare towels as well as being quite dirty (pool included).The staff were quite friendly although none the issues we had were addressed.I would advise people lokking at these viilas to look elsewere,Bhavana Private Villas
163,Jaded.,30,July 2012,"These Villas are 6 years old... And it shows. Dodgy workmanship, maintenance well overdue and seriously needs TLC.
Even the towels and bedding are the originals, judging by appearance.

We were promised a butler so subtle you wouldn't know he was there. We never saw him once.

On arrival we found a leaking toilet and an 'engineer' couldn't be found for 3 days.

A request for room service (2 beers) was promptly fulfilled, but with warm cans ("" we haven't got a fridge"").

Great shame, the Balinese Staff as you can imagine were as always superb, but it was clear there was no management or leadership, therefore very little process they could actually follow.

We saw no evidence of Managers/owners, and assume from this and the experience that they are likely disinterested in anything other than in keeping the occupancy high enough to pay for the property investment.

Nearer a 3 star, it sadly comes nowhere near a 5.",Bhavana Private Villas
164,Really Disappointed,20,July 2012,"I have been to Bail quite a few times now and stayed at many villas. This is definitely not a 5 star villa anymore. Whilst the staff are fantastic, the villas are tired, old and need some renovations. Our toilet leaked, our fridge needed repair, the TV is old school & nothing was ever replenished in the mini bar & the towels I think are the same towels from 6 years ago when it first opened (we got a beach towel with a period stain on it). If you want the 5 star experience then this is not the place to stay. Even the ""in-house freshly made breakfast"" is made off site & then just warmed up in your kitchen. Please do not be fooled by the claim it is a 5 star villa. There is so much building going on in Seminyak that I would look elsewhere to stay.",Bhavana Private Villas
165,LOVE,50,January 2012,AMAZING ! Staff was very nice.I would love to come back. The breakfast was beautiful they would come to your room to cook breakfast and coffee I had banana pancakes and fresh fruit every morning ..j ust gorgeous with rose petals in the pool and fine dining table setting.,Bhavana Private Villas
166,Average,40,May 2012,"The thing about this hotel is that everything is very average. Villas were nice enough but a little dated. Service wasn't bad,but neither did u get the very warm feeling from staff. Location was near the main road but the road condition leading to the hotel was full Of potholes. We paid 450 sin dollars a nite for the 2 room villa. Think for this price I was expecting a little more. It's jus a little too average for me:)",Bhavana Private Villas
167,Unhelpful,20,May 2012,"I stayed there last year with my partner and had a great time. Booked again for this year in a double villa for 10 days, at a cost of just on $4000 USD for 4 adults. They wanted to charge and extra USD $30 per day as they couldnt provide two single beds in one of the villas; and the extra money was for a roll a way bed. I have cancllled the booking for one that is not so greedy, and i will not be staying here again. VERY disappointed.",Bhavana Private Villas
168,Average Stay,30,March 2012,"We stayed here in March using a scoopons voucher (purchased for another villa which turned out to be fully booked even after my booking was confirmed via email!!).
The villa was nice but showing signs of age - we have stayed at nicer, however for $135 per night quite reasonable.
The breakfasts were lovely however further choices were needed after 2 or 3 nights.
The candle lit dinner was divine - just gorgeous with rose petals in the pool and fine dining table setting.
Downside:
The service was particularly bad during our stay.
Massages booked that never eventuated.
Even though the room service menu offered English tea to drink, when I tried to order it no one understood me and even after coming to see me so I could show them in the menu what I wanted I was finally brought ginger tea!!! Tea and coffee available in villa but note this does not include any English or ordinary tea - only Chinese tea.
There was only one sun lounge and when we asked for another so my husband and I could lie by the pool together we were told there was s strict 1 sun lounge per villa policy!!!
We also asked if we could upgrade to a 2 bedroom villa ( and pay the difference) but were told they were fully booked, which was fine, however another couple wanted to change from their 2 bedroom villa to a 1 bedroom villa and when we offered to swap with them, reception told us it wasn't possible!!!!!

Realistically, for what we paid the villa was comfortable and clean - good value for money. The service however let them down and was a Great disappointment to us as we are used to exceptional service in Bali.",Bhavana Private Villas
169,Could be excellent when renovations done. Avoid in-house massages,40,February 2012,"We went on a scoopon which was initially for Nunia Villas (part of same group but they changed us before we left due to poor reports on TripAdvisor - that's TA power for you).

We have villa 16 right at the back of the complex and it was very quiet and totally private. The villa, pool, gardens, outdoor area are all lovely and the personally cooked breakfast was wonderful - don't know how some could say otherwise? Given the advertised price of $400 a night it should have been in tip top condition. The complex is 6 years old we were told and it is showing signs of age - doesn't take long in the humidity. However, the management are undertaking renovations so it could achieve its ""excellent"" status shortly. Staff were very helpful and friendly.

Word of advice regarding in-villa massages - suggest you use elsewhere. We had one, mine on the bed, my wife was put on the daybed mattress on the floor. Most uncomfortable and hardly becoming of a top quality establishment. We complained and they halved the cost but that was still more than 2 at the local parlour.",Bhavana Private Villas
170,Weekend Getaway,40,January 2012,"If you want a weekend or holiday getaway maybe this is a great option. I like the fact that every room is a villa with their own private swimming pool. The room was beautifully designed and cleaned. I think the bathroom is unique and romantic but it can be a little bit dirty when it rains because it is semi out door, so sometimes dry leaves from outside fell in the floor, but I didn't think of it as a big issue.
Our room was in the back of the resort, it is very private but the pathway towards our villa is very dark and deserted. I hate walking back to our room alone.
The staff is very helpful and they really make our stay very private, which we love it. Behind the villa there is a rice paddy field, there are a lot of mosquitoes at night. But the hotel management is fully aware of that, they put an anti-mosquitoes spray in every corner of the villa, and there are staffs spray it in our villa every evening.
But we hate the food, a little bit expensive didn't worth the price. The breakfast wasn't that good either, but they cooked it inside your villa (the villa consist with bedroom, bathroom, swimming pool, kitchen, and living room). Aside from that, we definitely will come back someday.",Bhavana Private Villas
171,Thoroughly impressed with the villas,50,February 2012,"Was a scoopon offer original villa had been double booked so was transferred to this one
Service is fantastic. On arrival had freshly run bath with rose petals in. Complimentary massage in room
Daily breakfast of choice cooked in room tried different one each day were lovely
Had complimentary evening meal in room pool was covered in rose petals and lots of candles, very romantic
The villa had everything we needed and more tastefully decorated
Only downer is location once you venture out your own piece of paradise you are back in Bali, and Hye Bali is what Bali is!!!
Would definitely recommend staff Are wonderful. Villa gorgeous and very comfortable bed",Bhavana Private Villas
172,"Comfortable, very friendly staff, needs some updating",40,January 2012,"Stayed here for a long weekend recently. Great location (although the road is falling to bits), very close to restaurant row in Seminyak. Good sized villa and nice layout. Needs some updating as getting a bit tired, but little things would be easy to fix. New towels and some paint touch-ups would help. Staff were very friendly and very helpful. Room service = don't bother. Would definately go back.",Bhavana Private Villas
173,LOCATION! LOCATION! LOCATION!,40,January 2012,"The villas were perfect for us, as we were staying for two weeks, and the villas and staff make it easy for a longer stay.

The layout of the villa was great. Fantastic aircon in the bedroom, whilst the outside bathroom/living area/kitchen, allowed you to still sit out in the open, for the days when the rain was just too much and you wanted to have a lazy day by your own private pool, as we were visiting during the rainy season. There was no chance of cabin fever as it was extremely spacious.

The location, could not have been better! The villas were in walking distance to everything, whilst still being far enough back from the main road that you would have a quiet nights sleep. However, the mattress we had, definitely needed replacing, as it was bent out of shape and despite copious amounts of massages, we both left with crooked backs.

The only real down side for us, was the food (recommend, not paying for the breakfast as a part of accommodation deal). We were quite excited about the prospect of having someone come in and cook us a fresh breakfast every morning, however the bread was consistently stale, many dairy products we ordered were 6 or more months past their use by date and the 'fresh' fruit was rather poor quality for Bali standards. Not a major issue though, as there are so many places to eat, any time of day, in walking distance of the villas, with great cheap food.

The staff were so lovely and would consistently go out of their way to assist with any thing you needed and resolve any issues that arose.

We would recommend the villas to couples, friends, solo travellers and families.",Bhavana Private Villas
174,Spacious villas in central location,50,December 2011,"This hotel is great value. The villas are spacious and well set out. The daily breakfast in the room was great and had a good variety. The complimentary airport pick up and drop off was very convenient.
These villas are a 2 min walk to eat street restaurants and shopping. Overall great experience with friendly staff. Will definitely return.",Bhavana Private Villas
175,Good size villa in a centralish location but getting a bit tired and could do with a good clean,30,September 2011,"Good size and reasonably priced for seminyak but starting to get a bit run down.. Cracked tiles, old tv and cd player etc which would be okay if they cleaned the rooms and the pool a bit better.
Very handy to have your own pool and kitchen though if you want to make drinks/snacks. Reception staff were great but the morning breakfasts were pretty average, it depended on who came to your room to cook.",Bhavana Private Villas
176,Great place for couples,40,December 2011,"Nice villa with private pool. Breakfast prepared (already semi prepared) in your villa at exact time you requested. Clean and nice. Although loads of mosquitos and found a cockcroach around. Not surprising as it was formerly padi field and some padi fields still around. Many new villa under construction around which attribute to some pest around. A short distance walk to main road in Seminyak, probably 200-300 meters. Road condition a little messy and dirty to walk but acceptable.",Bhavana Private Villas
177,Wouldn't Recommend a Stay - Very Disappointed,20,October 2011,"Just returned after a 5 night stay - I have more mozzie bites in places I never thought I could have...Staff sprayed each night, mozzie coils burnt each night - however still so many around. Breakfast was very disappointing - had it once didn't bother to have again. Chef used kettle to boil eggs - found this out after day 3 when we went to make a cuppa - egg remains in kettle - told staff - still there when we left. Place looks pretty but not clean - pool dirty - I asked to have cleaned - again no go. Didn't bother to ask for anything else. Lots of new places going up in Seminyak - won't be going here again. This wasn't a cheap hotel - expected more.",Bhavana Private Villas
178,"It's fantastic and the staff are great. What ever you want they
Look after you :-)",50,October 2011,"Fantastic value for money
And the driver bang bang very friendly and helpful. All staff were nice and helpful",Bhavana Private Villas
179,A little oasis in the midst of Seminyak,40,July 2011,"The two-bedroom villa with pool is ideal for 2 couples. Plenty of space, and just a 5 minute walk to heaps of eating places. Ultimo on the corner was great quality for a very reasonable price.
Great breakfast here, though there were real mozzie problems, which I guess is inevitable with all the pools. The staff come around each evening for a big spray and to light mozzie coils, but if you are asthmatic, as one of our group was, their lungs couldn't cope with all the chemicals. However, the mosquito netting over the beds could have been improved - gaps all over the place. Better quality perhaps?
Overall though, it was great - and quiet, which was miraculous (though it could be a different story when the empty block next door is built on).",Bhavana Private Villas
180,Disappointed,10,July 2011,"We booked a 3nite stay but upon checking in, we informed the staff that we wanted to cancel the remaining two nights. The property is very old and badly maintained; bloodstained bed sheet, broken furniture, old ceiling fan that doesn't cool us down, dirty fridge etc. Food was not expensive but horrible. Luckily the staff were great n very accommodating. They didn't seem surprised when we wanted to shorten the stay. in fact, they were so obliging n helpful throughout.",Bhavana Private Villas
181,Needs Maintenance - Not value for $,30,June 2011,"The two English speaking staff I met - Yoga the Concierge and BungBung where exceptional - helpful, patient and efficient. The Villas themselves appeared to not be maintained and therefore I would rate these as 3 -to 3.5 stars. Looks ok, but nothing works. On first night I arrived I discovered the phone did not work, half the lights had blown and the lights bulbs were not replaced, there was no hot water in the shower, lock on Villa not secure etc… etc….

So looked ok but complete lack of maintenance and spent most of my time there trying to get things fixed…hardly relaxing",Bhavana Private Villas
182,Peaceful,50,June 2011,"Bhavana private Villas was one of the few places in the world I would want to go back to. The staff was attentive. The check in took exactly 3 mins and the Villa was spacious and has a lot of Privacy. The villas are clean and well equipped with all the necessary amenities. The best part about this Villa is the cook who come and cooks breakfast for you at your time. You just have to give your breakfast list and time to the reception. The pool is well maintained, but the only problem was the lights, most of the switches were not working but were repaired immediately once we called the reception. It's quite and private...peaceful and calm. The best part is the location. All the best restaurants are 1 min away. This part of Seminiyak is the best. It's superb for friends and couples who want to spend time in the room and relax before going out in the night. Please ask the reception to come and spray a mosquito spray just before sunset. I recommend Bhavana Villas. Excellent.",Bhavana Private Villas
183,"Quiet, yet not isolated",40,June 2010,"Actually we stayed here in October 2009, but trip advisor only provides date of stay from June 2010 and I have to choose one. It was 3 nights stayed and we would like to extend but its fully booked.

Its a nice and very clean private villa with swimming pool.
Every morning at requested time, 2 staffs came to cook your choice of breakfast in villa's kitchen. And in the evening they inflamed some candles, did mosquito sprays and mosquito net around bed. Romantic vibe is in the air :).
It is a quiet, yet not isolated villa. Plenty of Seminyak upmarket restaurants are in walking distance.

I was disappointed at first day because they gave me dirty looked towel and bit torn - something i can't understand considering its rate - but they immediately replace it when i complained.
Also, we wonder why shuttle never available because my experiences in some private villas there's always shuttle around. Even in peak season, its only required an hour or two hours booking in advance. We stopped asking after three times got no results.
Lucky that they have smart and helpful receptionist who will always help to find a cab or make reservation in super busy restaurant as Warisan.

At that time, there was a special rate for Garuda Frequent Flyer which wei noticed after stay, unfortunately. In my opinion, if the receptionist were acknowledge about its join promotions and inform it to the guest, that would be another plus point. Or at least put the info somewhere around check in counter.",Bhavana Private Villas
184,Had a wonderful stay.,40,April 2011,"We were very impressed with the villas and service. We have never been to Bali so reading all the reviews from Trip Advisor was very helpful. All of the positive reviews were correct I found once we arrived. We did not have one negative experience. We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa. We have two young boys- 6 yo and 5 yo. They thoroughly enjoyed the private plunge pool. We stayed in the villas for 6 nights. Every morning they came and cooked breakfast which was pretty good. I had the American Breakfast and my husband had the Omelet. There was more food than we could ever eat :) You pick your breakfast the day before and the time you want them to come in the morning. They were always on time. The rooms were pretty clean and have no complaints there. They come every night and do turndown service and light mosquito coils and let the nets down around the beds. I wanted to mention what is in the actual rooms- a DVD player, TV, hair dryer, and plug adaptors. My suggestion is that you bring your own hair dryer though because the ones there are not very powerful. Due to country codes on the DVD players it doesn't do much good to bring your own DVDs. There was a good selection of channels (kids and adults) on TV so not being able to play DVDs was not a big deal. I cannot really think of one negative thing about the rooms or our stay at Bhavana. I think for the price, location, and service it was a great deal. I recommend that you call ahead and arrange your pick-up from the airport (this is provided in the cost of the room). There are so many villas in Semenyak that it would be impossible for a taxi driver to know where this particular villa is located. But for future reference tell the taxi that your villa is in Semenyak and to turn onto the road located next to Ultimo (most know that restaurant as it is a pretty popular eating spot) and then it is towards the end of the road on the right). Only take the Blue Bird Taxi cabs- they use a meter and do not try to negotiate with other cab drivers- just take the Blue Taxis. Also, for anything you want to do outside the hotel try to get a driver so that they will take you to your destination, wait for you all day, and then drive you back to the villa. Only tip I can think of that you don't want to leave home without is Insect Repellant. Spray yourself as soon as the sun starts to set- my son got eaten alive while we were in Bali. I think the mosquitos just really liked him as the rest of us only got a few bites but we were applying spray constantly :). I highly recommend staying in Semenyak because it is not as intense as Kuta and Legion. The vendors in Kuta just grab your arm and want you to buy from their shop and this happens as soon as you are out of your hotel. In Semenyak there are lots of shops but you can walk down the street without being harassed. Some people like this but it is not my cup of tea. We didn't spend too much time in Kuta for that main reason. Ok, last tip- always, always, always negotiate. Cut the price the vendors give you by at least 50%. For example, we bought one of those huge wooden couch like things for $200/USD (in Katoomba- 10 minutes from Semenyak) and when we were in Ubud I wanted one of the wooden mask and the market lady started with the same price as what I bought my wooden couch for. I read all the other reviews from Trip Advisor and you can feel pretty comfortable with what they have to say.",Bhavana Private Villas
185,Amazing villas - HIGHLY recommended for a romantic break,50,January 2011,"My husband and I stayed five nights at the Aston Bhavana villas in January 2011. We definitely made the right decision booking here. As many have mentioned the road to the villas is in very poor condition, however this is not something that's within the hotel's control, and it's REALLY not a big deal.
The villas themselves are beautiful - reception areas are lovely, and from reception there is a beautiful greenery-filled walkway to the villas. Ornate carved doors open into a garden oasis. The pool is much bigger than it looks in promotional pictures on the hotel website.
The living areas are completely open to the elements, but even in pouring rain you stay dry. Careful though - the marble floors become a rink of death when wet.
The bedroom is the only room not open to the air, and is air-conditioned. The air conditioner is very quiet and it's lovely to walk into the cool room from the humidity outside. The bathroom is open air. The bathtub is deep and comfortable.
Overall the villa felt very luxurious and was well-maintained the whole time we were there by housekeeping.
The staff are very helpful and attentive. The in-room breakfast is delicious and there's something great and very relaxing about not having to ferret through a buffet to have your breakfast exactly as you want it. There is a turn-down service every evening where staff Baygon all the corners in your room, light the mosquito coils etc.
In terms of the location it is very close to eat street - a five to ten minute walk at the most. Taxis cost next to nothing. There's no need to settle the price with the driver beforehand, we did this once and it was much more expensive than if we'd gone by the meter. Despite the claims in the hotel website to have a driver available, he was mysteriously nowhere to be found when we requested him. But it really didn't matter as taxis are cheap and plentiful. The front desk staff are happy to call you a cab at any time. The free wi-fi didn't work in the room, only in reception but in the end it was better not having internet access as it forced us to relax away from a computer screen.

The villa was great for a couple's holiday - I wouldn't recommend it for a family with kids as the pool in the villa is not fenced. Likewise the vibe of the villas is not really suited to a group of friends as it is very quiet and low-key. In fact probably the only annoying thing during our stay was the fact that one evening, some guests in a villa near us were using their stereo to blast top 40 hits.

Overall - highly recommend Aston Bhavana. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. If you are going on a romantic holiday I highly recommend the candlelit dinner- very reasonably priced and very special.",Bhavana Private Villas
186,Very Happy,40,December 2010,"This is the first time we have stayed in a villa and only our 3rd trip to Bali, and we were both really happy we stayed here.
From the moment we were picked up from the airport (ice cold water provided for the trip), to the time we left we found the staff to be very friendly, professional and happy.
THE VILLA:-
We stayed in a one bedroom villa. The bedroom is airconditioned, the bed- a king size- was very comfy. The bathroom is huge and semi outdoors with 2 showers and a huge bath. The outdoor area has a kitchen, fridge, dining table, 2 day beds and a ceiling fan. It's undercover so you can still sit out there when it rains. The pool was clean and cleaned everyday and a little garden completes the private oasis. Privacy is never compromised & it's quiet.
Breakfast is included and they come set up your table and cook for you. My wife loved the banana pancakes and I loved the Noodles. Variety is not bad and kept us happy for our week stay.
STAFF:-
Very friendly, polite, eager to please, willing to help and professional. The in house massage was a nice way to finish our stay there- although we went out for our massages everyday.
Turn down service every night complete with lighting the mosquito coils and they sprayed for mozzies twice a day.
Yes there are things you could pick on if you're truly fussy but hey it's the tropics so of course you're going to see the odd sign. But above all else it was very very clean. I will miss the finches and the white geckos.
THE GROUNDS:-
Beautiful and very Balinese. Welcoming and relaxing.
LOCATION:-
A 10 minute walk to eat street and yes the road just outside the hotel has potholes but nowhere near as bad as some reviews have suggested and the street has lights. The complimentary driver service took us to Spa Bali everyday for our massage no problems.
Its also an equal driving distance to either Sarong or Metis (two of the best restaurants in Bali).
Would I stay again?- you bet!",Bhavana Private Villas
187,A relaxing stay in quiet seminyak,40,September 2010,"From the point of contact at the airport upon pickup right through to checking out, the service was brilliant,. The stay... relaxing and enjoyable. The 1bedroom villa was lovely and the layout suited a trio of girlfriends just perfectly with the order of an extra bed. We spent a majority of our time hanging out in the living area overlooking the pool enjoying the extra space you dont get in a hotel room or large resort. This enabled one of us to have a rest and the others to still enjoy the space. We felt the villa gave us plenty of privacy and although they were fully booked, we never heard any other guests. We throughly enjoyed having our breakfast cooked for us each morning and ordering in room service was cheap and enjoyable.... The overall stay was enjoyable... but... and i say this without sounding too negative... there were a few things i could get picky about if i were a resort critic and looking for 5 star luxury. However given the price we paid, compared to some other villas i'd researched and considered, we feel we definately got our moneys worth. So if you are looking for 5 star +, perhaps consider eleswhere but expect to pay somewhat more. It was just minor things we noticed like a chipped tile, discolouration of paint in some areas, one of the decking boards sunk when we stepped on it, the mirror blackening around the edges, that sort of thing... as i said, just minor things... the villas are not looking 'brand new' and sparkling as shown on the website but you must consider that they are a few years old so are a little tired. however the great open space, extremely comfy bed and beautiful soft linen, quietness of the area, and open spance bathroom certainly out weighed any tiredness the villa presented.
The one and only thing that i gripe about is upon checkout we had a bit of a dilema. There was a new staff on in training and with the language barrier and him not truly understanding the eftpos system he could not process payment on my visa card. He also had trouble processing my friends card and we only were able to use my other friends card to check out which meant she had to cover the cost for all three of us. Then (because the staff member was new) somehow charged us twice....! it was a problem at the time and kept us waiting and worrying for about an hour, but since has been rectified and funds are being transfered back.
Would i stay there again? if it hadnt been for the problematic checkout - sure... but given this i'm not sure if i'd trust that i'd be able to make payment upon checkout.
if you do stay here... some tips....
- shopping along the main strip wasnt all its cracked up to be. Do check out saturday and sunday markets at seminyak square.
- Geneva Department Store is a great one stop shop full of everything you'd find at markets and matahari and discovery plaza but on a much cheaper scale and prices are already preset so no bartering required.
- The Living Room is beautiful and divine - food is 5+ Star!!! Order the duck breast!
- The Hu'u Bar (opposite living room) is a great spot to enjoy a drink, has big cushions on lawn set amongst fairy lit trees to chill out on.
- Be sure to book the driver if you have plans, dont expect him to be available all the time.",Bhavana Private Villas
188,"Great value, friendly staff, good location",50,July 2010,"We had a lovely time there. Hints:take your own tea and coffee so you have the independence of room service which is really cheap but nice to get a cuppa when you wake up. The street outside is rough but Bali streets are like that, and its only 50 cents for a taxi to Ku De Ta and with taxis (Bluebird) so cheap you dont need to walk. They will do laundry for you. Don't expect to run a full bath as the hot water doesnt last that long but showers are fine. The banana pancakes are yummy and they do good chips and i liked their seared tuna. Get your brekkie menu in fast or someone could grab the timeslot you want. If like us you get a torrential downpour there will be a bit of water come in, but that's being abroad for you! We could always get a car okay and they will arrange for dinner in Jimbaran Bay with free transport there and back which we enjoyed.",Bhavana Private Villas
189,Private relaxing haven in Seminyak,50,June 2010,"We stayed at Bhavana Villas for 10 days and loved it. We have been to Bali many times before but this time wanted to try a different type of accommodation. We would normally have stayed in a large 4 or 5 star hotel in Kuta or Legian but chose Bhavana private villas and were very impressed with the service and facilities. Everything was exactly as portrayed on the website. I was sceptical when I booked it but it truly was exactly as the website stated.

The villas are on a small side road (pot holed and bumpy) in Seminyak, walking distance to some very nice restaurants and shops. A taxi into the heart of Kuta only cost about 25,000 Rupiah which is less than $5 AUD. So for just a few dollars you can enjoy the peace and tranquility of Seminyak but still be close to the hectic hustle and bustle of Kuta. If you want to be in amongst the action, then maybe Seminyak is not the place for you. If you want to relax in the privacy of a walled compound with a sparkling pool and luxurious gardens then Bhavana Villas is the right place.

The villas are not new but are well kept. I have read other travellers' reviews and some have mentioned worn or old linens but our towels etc were fluffy and smelled beautifully clean and fresh every morning. The staff were efficient, friendly and always smiling. Breakfast was cooked for us in our villa every morning at the pre-arranged time. The pool was more than large enough for our needs and so convenient. In the larger hotels using the pool is often quite stressful as other people's children are running about, screaming or jumping on you, when all you really want to do is relax and enjoy a nice swim. At Bhavana Villas, the pool is your own and we enjoyed ours at all times of the day from 8 am until 11pm. There was no time restrictions. The villas do not have a bar or a restaurant on site but the room service menu is quite extensive and very competitively priced. The local convenience stores all sell alcohol and soft drinks which can be kept in your refrigerator.

While in Bali, I celebrated my birthday. My partner arranged with the hotel staff to fill the pool with beautiful flowers while we were out at the Safari Park. What a surprise when we returned to our villa, then we had a wonderful candlelit dinner by the poolside. The next morning, the pool boys returned to clear all the flowers from the pool and within 20 minutes it was all back to normal again. A fantastic memory of a beautiful relaxing holiday at the Bhavana villas.",Bhavana Private Villas
190,Great Rooms - Not to good on service,30,May 2010,"These were great rooms pool fantastic. Make sure you take mozzie spray and a little balinese language aswell. The staff tried to help but were poorly trained, couldn't speak english well which made it hard to communicate needs, which was dissapointing also the car was never available unlike what it says in the brochures. Food was average so we ate out most the time, I think this would be great for return travellers to Bali who like there own space and confident in the area as there is no real service or help.",Bhavana Private Villas
191,Hidden Delight,40,June 2010,"Just returned from a couple of fantastic weeks in Bali, one of which was spent at the Beautiful Aston Bhavana Villas in Seminyak. These villas are in an excellent location, just off ""Eat Street"" their in the street where the famous Ultimo restauraunt is on the corner, a copule of minutes walk from all the shops and restauraunts (disregard all the maps you see because none of them are accurate). Having stayed at Elysium Villas last time and paid approx $350 per night, Aston Bhavana is exceptional value at approx $200 per night (Great Value). we had a one bedroom villa with private pool, outdoor kitchen and dining area, lovely bathroom with outdoor shower. the villas are nice and quiet unlike some other locations where villas back onto side roads etc... these are all well located off the roads. Service is excellent, loads of staff to attend to any and all your requests. Breakfast is fantastic, they actually come to your villa at the time you request and cook your breakfast in your outdoor kitchen for you. I would not hesitate in staying at these wonderful Villas again, very hard to beat for Value and location. We hired a motor bike for the week we were there, the staff organised it for us for approx $6 a day. the beach is approx 2 minutes on the bike, you could walk, but after long days at the beach, we prefered to just jump on the bike to get back to our beautiful Villa.",Bhavana Private Villas
192,Comfortable in Seminyak,40,March 2010,"We stayed 3 nights in Seminyak at the Aston after 3 nights in Jimbaran - two very different resorts but both enjoyable. The one bed villa was comfortable, the setting clean and well kept and the pool refreshing. OK there are were few small things to be sorted in maintenance (trims not fitting, a broken deck board) but these did not distract at all from our stay.
Good things about the Aston Bhavana:
1)To wake up to breakfast served in your room, cooked to your liking was a real treat.
2) The bathroom - a real novelty to be in and out side.
3) The courtesy car which took us to the restaurants in the immediate neighbourhood, to our next hotel and the airport at the end of the trip. (Also the pickup from our reort prior was competitively priced - not the usual high price, hotel transfer).
4) The area - right in amongsth the old Seminyak with padi fields and traditional houses but just up the road from some great restaurants on Jalan Oberoi.
5) The peace and quiet. Even though the hotel was full there was no noise from adjacent villas. Great for lounging around and doing nothing!",Bhavana Private Villas
193,Luxurious,50,July 2007,"We booked the Aston Bhavana (formerly Sesari Bali) for the last week of our honeymoon and it was the perfect end to a busy trip around Bali.

We ordered breakfast every morning and requested some items that weren't on the menu and it was such a treat to have it cooked for us in our villa kitchen. Our villa was spotless and every night at dusk there was a turn down service which included the mozzie control team. The resort is fairly new and is in a great location - quiet but close enough to nightlife if you fancy going out. Our stay included a free massage and a luxury candlelit meal by our private pool which we had on our last night. Amazing service!",Bhavana Private Villas
194,Poorly Managed,20,February 2010,"Giving their guest privacy is the only good thing about this hotel/villas but the rest I must agreed with some of the review. Floor was filthy, in the dining room and in the bed room, bathroom wall full of water mark, etc.No management presence from the day we arrived till the day we checked out. One of the most uncomfortable bed that we've ever encounter. I think Aston should do some changes, as one of the leading brand in Indonesia in terms of building & service. Do not let this type of service ruin the quality of hospitality in Bali, especially with the rate that they offer to public.",Bhavana Private Villas
195,Good stay.,40,February 2010,"My husband and I had 6 nights booked. We were in Villa 16, which is right at the back of the complex. Villas are clean and very private. Staff were friendly and offered a shuttle service to Kuta for us. This could be a one off - not really sure as they were going to the airport to pick up other guests.
While we were there it rained and the water seemed to splash into the living area- the living area and bathroom are outdoors and undercover. The bedroom was air conditioned and had a flat screen TV to watch from your bed. Breakfast was good but did become a bit boring towards the end of our stay- restaurants are close and meals are reasonably cheap if you wanted to eat something different elsewhere. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family.
The only problem we found with this hotel is that the road out front was very potholed and dark of a night.",Bhavana Private Villas
196,Loved it,50,January 2010,"Just back from a 5 night stay at the Aston and we loved it. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Everything inside the Villa was clean.
It was a little bit of a walk to the heart of Seminyak but close to very nice restaurants all the same. Didn't really matter to us as we were there to relax, not to shop.
Food in the Villas was great, especially the price of it. Couldn't believe that room service was costing us less than dining out.
Definitely recommend it for a quiet, relaxing, chilled out holiday.",Bhavana Private Villas
197,will not return here,20,December 2009,"I was appalled by - the blood stained mattress (villa 4), the front of house staff and the general lack of cleanliness at this property. We have visited Bali on 8 occasions prior to this visit and have stayed in many different hotels and villas, this was by far the worst. It is a shame because the villas are in a good position in Seminyak and with a bit of TLC they could be bought up to standard.",Bhavana Private Villas
198,"beautiful villas, fantastic pool, close to restaurants - service average, a hike from the beach!",40,November 2009,"Beautiful beautiful villas - great private pool, gorgeous bedroom and lounge area. Very comfy bed! Bathroom area was fantastic too.

Service was a bit average though - we received everything we asked for/needed, but wasn't always 100% pleasant.

Also a bit of a hike to the beach - but only a couple of dollars in a cab.

Road to the main road a bit rocky and hard to navigate - especially at night.

Coincidentally the hotel transport was always 'busy' when we needed it, but no real drama - plenty of taxis around.

Would reccommend to friends though. Perfect if you want to spend some time at your accommodation to relax.",Bhavana Private Villas
199,"Beautiful villas, friendly staff, and food is amazing value.",50,October 2009,"Stayed one night in a two-bedroom villa after having spent two nights in Ubud. The villas are beautiful -- great private pool, spacious common living / dining room, and very clean and comfy bedrooms. The room service is amazingly great value! I was shocked at the low food prices; the food was excellent and came with super service. Only potential downside is the location. It's a bit off the beaten path, but it's a very short cab ride to the main drag in Seminyak or the villa staff may drive you there themselves (which they did for us). Great service all around!",Bhavana Private Villas
200,A Very Pleasant Place,50,January 2009,"My sis opted for Hard Rock Hotel, but I didn't want to stay in Kuta or Legian. I wanted to stay in Seminyak. Last year I stayed at Resor Seminyak and really like the area. My sis came up with Aston Bhavana. Very quiet place, we thought we are the only family that was staying. Great service, friendly staff, good breakfast, nice room, huge bathroom (we really like the bathroom hahahha) and decent private pool.
10 mins from Rumors, Trattoria and Ultimo. The only down side is quite far from the beach.......... Nonetheless we LOVE our stay!",Bhavana Private Villas
201,A perfect stay over 4 weeks.,50,August 2008,"We stayed here for nearly four weeks in August 2008 and had a fantastic time. The villas were changing management at the time as the name had just changed to this from Sesari Bali ( useful to know for taxi drivers btw!). We were two couples and each booked a one bedroom villa/compound. Decor and upkeep were perfect. The private pool, though not huge is deep and was a pleasure to use each morning before breakfast and bed time. Breakfast is ordered in the evening and made up in your room's kitchen. We loved the indoor / outdoor living and bathroom areas. All efforts were taken by staff to minimise the dramatic effects of the mosquitoes. It is very well located with easy access to restaurants etc. We loved our stay and were sorry not to return this sumer (though we had noticed that the rates have almost doubled under the new management !!) - Our only little gripe was th fact that WiFi was only available in the lobby area and even then on a very sporadic basis.",Bhavana Private Villas
202,amazing holiday experience,50,August 2009,"have been to bali 8 times and work in the travel industry, this trip was a definate highlight and will be recommending to my clients. Staff offer the most amazing service level and you will be relaxed in no time while enjoying the pivacy of your villa. Great location for restaurants and short walk to beach. thank you for a beautiful stay! Sarah Adcock",Bhavana Private Villas
203,Incredible villa. Immaculately kept and well appointed. Would definitely recommend,50,June 2009,"We stayed at Aston Bhavana for 2 weeks and experienced the best service we have ever received in terms of efficiency of staff, room service, maintenance and servicing of . rooms and staff cooked breakfast. The professionalism of the staff was wonderful - I'd never met more lovelier and obliging people who aim to please at every opportunity. We have a 21 month old boy and he loved the pool, although not having a fence was a bit tricky but we knew this upon booking and watched him at every moment. He loved it!!
The privacy of the villas was great and the location in central Seminyak was ideal! The shops and restaurants were within a few minutes walk.
We will definately go there again next year and would highly recommend this venue.",Bhavana Private Villas
204,Simply Wonderful!,40,May 2009,"My husband & I just got back from Bali 2 days ago, and we already miss Bali and the lovely people. We stayed at Aston Bhavana Villa and really had the time of our lives there. It is clean, and simply beautiful. You really get what you see on their website. What's really remarkable is the service staff. They are friendly, extremely helpful and ever-ready with a smile. It's like returning to a 2nd home each day.
Thank you Aston Bhavana for making our 1st trip to Bali such a memorable one!
Mr & Mrs Marcus",Bhavana Private Villas
205,Loved it!!!,40,May 2009,"Have only returned from Bali this morning after spending 10 nights at the villas and just had to share our experience with you. We absolutely loved our villa (17) very quiet and as stated by a previous reviewer a place you wouldn't want to leave and we didn't at least for the most part. . We were greeted on arrival by Bam Bang in a very new vehicle and nothing was too much trouble. Because of a very busy airport it took forever to get out but were met by a smile even though it was 2am in the morning. Check in was easy and we were shown to our villa which was beautifully lit. Instantly loved it. At 2am we took our first dip in the wonderful pool and that is where we stayed for the next 10 days. I had requested a quiet villa and on the sunny side of the street to avoid a shaded pool and this request was met. Mind you we were there for 10 days and hardly saw another guest. When we were leaving for airport met another couple who had also been there the same 10 days and we had never seen them. The villas are so quiet and have everything you need. The in villa breakfast was wonderful and varied and cooked and served by delightful staff ever eager to please. Once again nothing was too much trouble. We took afternoon tea most days in our villa and this too was great. Maybe a few western options could be made available as rice cakes may not be to everyone's taste. Still a treat though. Room service meals were very reasonably priced and like the breakfast was set up on your dining table, all the glamour of a restaurant without leaving the villa. Privacy was assured by the do not disturb plaque which you could place on the hook by the entrance to your villa. This was never abused. All you really have to do is make sure to remove it for room cleaning, turn down etc. As per a previous review the linen and towels really need to be upgraded as they probably prevent me from giving it 5 stars. I think there is something about crisp white linen and fluffy towels that give you that 5 star experience. Having said that you are not paying 5 star price so please do not expect it but what you will get is a wonderful holiday, extremely friendly and efficient staff, lovely villa, brilliant pool and somewhere you can call home whilst in Bali. Having travelled extensively I would have to say this was probably the best relaxing holiday we have ever had. The road leading to the villa is without a doubt awful and in urgent need of some sort of repair work but never prevented my husband or I walking it by day or night. Yes you have to dodge puddles, holes, motobikes, taxis, people but it is all part of the bali experience and this same road was home to many other ""5"" star villas so please do not let this put you off staying at the Bhavana . Thank you Aston Bhavana for a fantastic holiday experience and we will be back.",Bhavana Private Villas
206,Great hideaway,40,March 2008,"Fantastic for the discerning traveller.
Don't pay rack rate, we got it pretty damn cheap through online.
Great in-villa spa treatment
Tiny bit out the way but nice to walk off the dinners in Seminyak.
Why put up with fat bogans when you don't have to? :)",Bhavana Private Villas
207,"Aston Bhavana Villas, Seminyak",50,,"13/3/09 - 20/3/09

We have just come back from staying at the Aston Bhavana Villas in Seminyak and we had the most wonderfull holiday staying at the Villas.

The Staff were very friendly and courteous at all times and were only to pleased to help you in anyway.
The Villa itself was fantastic, very private and presented beautifully.

I had read some of the reviews from other people who had stayed at the Villas, some were good and some not, so was a little apprehensive as to what we would find, BUT, we were not disappointed in any way.

Yes the road outside to Eat St, which is only a matter of 5 minutes away, or anywhere else for that matter, is a very rocky uneven road, by day, its fine, by nite, we chose to get a Taxi to bring us home so that was not a problem for us. Ants, yes, a few from time to time, but lets face it, everyone has ants, dont they, to complain about them is a little petty i think.

Our Villa was gorgeous, and to anyone thinking of staying at these Villas i thoroughly reccomend them. I am a little on the *fussy* side, or so my family tells me, but everything done whilst our stay at these Villas was perfect for us.

Doesnt matter where u stay, there are always a few little hiccups or dislikes, none of us are the same, so i guess what people have said in previous previews, they are allowed to have there opinions. For us, this holiday was very special, our Villa was cleaned everyday, our breakfast was very tasty and the little things like the bed being turned back at nite with 2 little chocolates with a small card which read *sweet dreams* made it all the nicer.

Our furniture didnt have any water damage at all, thats not to say that perhaps there are 1 or 2 Villas with this problem, BUT, can see why this could happen, as one day it just poured down with rain, and of course, being a traditional Balinese type open Villa, the rain tends to come inside on the tiles a little, other than that, everything was fine. Within and hour after rain stopping, floor was fine.

Once again, we had the most wonderfull relaxing holiday at these Villas, cant speak highly enough of the Villas or the Staff, they were just as wonderfull as the holiday.

to Aston Bhavana Villas, Seminyak. *THANKYOU SO MUCH*

208,Not bad!,50,August 2008,"My wife and I stayed there for the final week of our honeymoon after visiting Borneo and Kuala Lumpur. This was by far the most romantic part of our trip. The cooked breakfast each morning by our pool and romantic dinner as part of the 'honeymoon package' was something to behold (especially with the petals sprinkled in the pool).

The only slight nuisance was the non-existant pavement to and from the hotel. Other than this I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a fantastic honeymoon.",Bhavana Private Villas
209,Loved it...but....,20,February 2009,"Me and my hubby just got back from Bali recenty & stayed at this villa - it was highly rec ommended by one of my hubby's friends so we decided to try it out instead of going to a hotel -- Here' s what we both loved and disliked abt the villa :)

1) The staff were polite and accomodating. They were also very prompt with their service
2) Pricing for food was reasonble and not exhorbitant! However, yes, breakfast was a bit boring cos there wasnt much to choose from!
3) Loved the idea of themserving free tea from 3-5pm: It even came along with some tasty teatime snacks!
4) It was great hving the pool in the villa but hubby and me didnt even use it once! Firstly, it was pouring and virtually impossible to get in there with that much of rain....plus when it was sunny, the pool was filled with aot of leaves and flowers which had fallen frm the nearby trees! :( Perhaps, the mgmt can think abt installing a retractable shade ovr the pool so that guests can still swim despite the weather conditions.
5) Our utensils in the villa were plagued with ants!! Yes,huge ants and we had to get housekeeping to immediately spray some insecticide! We were a lil worried abt the hygiene cos they used the same utensils to cook our breakfast the next day!
6) Bathroom facilities were great too - u have the choice of showering the tub, outdoor or indoor.. :)
7) Yes, roads leading to villa is dingy and terrible. Uneven and even a lil scary! But all the great restaurants and even a mini-mart is just 5-8 mins away
8) Hotel staff also seemed reluctant to provide the free shuttle - saying that they only hv 2 drivers but we managed to get them to bring us to KUTA but had to take the taxi on the way back :S

Overall, I would rate my stay 3.5/5",Bhavana Private Villas
210,You get what you pay for,20,January 2009,"What you see on the website for Aston Bhavana Villas is a very accurate portrayal of the villas. It was fabulous having our own pool, chef for breakfast and, for the price (around AUD300 per night, peak season) one of the villa bargains of Bali.

However, you do get what you pay for and I would say that anyone wanting a 5 star villa experience would be disappointed - it was good value for 3 ½ stars. Small things like sheets and towels that were threadbare and that I would have thrown away at home; only one sun lounge by the pool (for a 2 person villa with another requested but not available); no doorbell on the villa front entrance so that staff had to bang on the gate and YELL to let us know that they were there which was almost impossible to hear if you were inside; poorly designed drainage and protection from the weather in the open areas so that minor flooding reached furniture and consequently there was severe rotting near floor level of benches, occasional tables etc.; dingy and dark kitchen area; very ordinary bathroom toiletries (I’m a bit picky about the quality of toiletries when you’re paying this sort of money) ; rusty soap container in the shower etc etc.

These were minor things for us and didn’t detract from the experience, but I’m sure that, for many people wanting a luxurious ‘villa’ holiday (regardless of the cost) these issues would have potentially wrecked their stay. I still maintain though that, for the price, this property is really good value.

The villas themselves are located about a 5-10 minute walk from Jl. Laksama (Oberoi) but unfortunately the street they are located on is a virtually unmade road, unlit, with potholes and rough edges. This was a nightmare after the one severe rainstorm we had and, if you have kids or are elderly, you simply would not be able to make that walk to the main street and would be forced to get a taxi. As it was it took us twice as long as we manouvered the, now full, potholes along with all the other traffic. Having said that, this is typical of other streets in Seminyak and other areas in Bali.

Overall, I would say that the villa website gives an accurate image of the villas but it will be important for many people to understand some of the things that detract from this property. Consequently, the attached photos are posted to consider in conjunction with the website photos.",Bhavana Private Villas
211,Aston Bhavana Villas - Position is hard to beat!,40,January 2008,"We stayed in a 1brm villa with our 4 year old for a week after New Years Eve. This was a first visit to Bali but I am sure that we will be returning - and would have no hesitation in staying at Aston Bhavana again. To make this easy I am going to review in a like/dislike way:

LOVED:
The position is excellent - it is directly behind Sentosa and less than a 5 minute walk to Eat Street. We were originally going to stay at another villa but when we drove past later were so glad that we chose Bhavana - it is in a much better position.
Very close to all the great restaurants: Trattoria, Ku De Ta, La Luciola, Sarong, Cafe Warisan, Warung Sobat (is only short drive away) and all the ones near Trattoria (on Eat Street).
Walking distance to Cool Spa (best reflexology - our 4 year old fell asleep and had 2 sessions!) and Bodyworks.
Very comfortable bed - it seemed bigger than our King at home and we all slept very comfortably.
Best overseas cable TV choice I have EVER seen - normally you only get a couple of channels to choose from (1 news and 1 MTV!). This had about 35-40.
Lovely linen, big fluffy towels for pool and bathroom.
The Villa is gorgeous... not going to bother posting photos as will just duplicate other earlier reviews.
Staff were very friendly.
The privacy of staying in a villa but with hotel service.
The price - very good value for money in comparison with other villas.
The manager was really lovely and would make an effort to find out anything you had been asking about.
The babysitter they recommended - Alicia... we were lucky to nab her for 3 nights after another family left who kept her for 2 weeks. We had 3 lovely date nights which we thoroughly needed and enjoyed, worry-free!

DISLIKED:
Sometimes you had to really push the staff into giving you a drop off down the road etc, although this is a service they provide. I ended up after 2 'no's' just making a joke and asking if they were just pretending about the drop off service. After this we didn't have a problem - mostly because we hired a motorbike!
Breakfast got a bit boring and repetitive - we ate out 3/7 mornings as we got a bit bored with it. Lovely food, just repetitive. You will love it if you are an eggs and bacon kind of person but I got sick of egg, bacon, same danish, same jam, same fruit etc. We fed this back to them so they may spruce it up.
No use of outdoor tiles so can get a bit slippery after pool use or when it rains (when water pools at the back near the kitchen).
Don't use their VIP pick up service (it cost us $US40 p/p but was not the same level of service as other TA reviews; where they report about lounge and drinks while luggage etc is collected, we just had someone walk us through customs, buy the visa while we waited standing and then stood together waiting for luggage). That was a bit useless and a big rip off I thought.

By the way: I just wanted to mention an earlier review that someone posted about having to return toiletries. The little bottles of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel are on the bath and are ceramic - they are obviously meant to stay there. I have no idea how someone would think they could take them home???? Very very weird - especially as they still have a box by the sink full of normal hotel amenities... toothbrushes, comb, razor, sewing etc etc.",Bhavana Private Villas
212,wonderful experience,50,October 2008,"I love Bali very much, together with my husband and other couples, we always stayed in five star hotel. This time we want to spend in private villas instead. And we find Aston bhavana, perfecly located in prime area in Seminyak. we are very happy with this decision. The design is so cozy and the villas is so spacious, the ambience is so fresh, we could relax in our private pool, and having a chef cooked in our villas, the service is absolutely high end, we feel so special.
This experience could never been forgotten.",Bhavana Private Villas
213,a no stater,10,August 2008,"we booked to stay at the sesari in Jan 08 for aug 08. We booked well in advance to avoid dissapointment. We booked the honeymoon package & we were really excited to stay here as we had read all the reviews before hand & was delighted with our choice. on arrival in bali after travelling for 30 hours, our driver picked us up & handed us a letter. The letter stated that they had over booked & were moving us to another complex. we were transferred to the sun island resort. The sun island was a nice resort but no way near as nice as the sesari. We were deeply disappointed by this especially as this was our honeymoon. we didn't get the honeymoon package as requested. so we missed out on having our breakfast & dinner cooked for us in the villa. as a way of compensation they offered us a free massage! i was really gutted that this happened to us on our honeymoon & would warn other potential customers to be careful!",Bhavana Private Villas
214,didn't meet expectation,20,,"We chose this place after getting almost no response from any other villas during the peak season last July. Everything went well except for some breakfast issue we had on the second day and some problem on the last day. Take note of this, you have to fill in the breakfast form and give it to the hotel everyday or nothing will come for you the next morning. The staff was trying hard to be friendly but unfortunately they were not efficient enough. They didn't explain to us about the breakfast arrangement. Also, on the last day of our three-night stay, they made me open my luggage to return used plastic bottles of shampoo and soap! It was embarassing because we thought they were hotel amenities that you can take, surely we had no intention of stealing them! I have stayed in many hotels and never had this problem anywhere else before, so it was quite an awkward situation. Other than that the place was beautiful, surrounded by lush garden, a typical Balinese villa with private pool. Two nice staff will cook and serve you breakfast every morning. The area is quite secluded and rather far from everywhere so renting a car is recomended if you want to stay there.",Bhavana Private Villas
215,Amazing,50,August 2008,"A giant villa, a private pool, a sprawling outdoor area and breakfast cooked each morning in your suite? What's not to like. You'd have to spend $600+ anywhere else in the world to get pampered like this. If you like being around other people, this isn't the place for you. If you want to spend a few days literally cut off from the world in your own oasis, head on over. Only down side is a precarious walk down a narrow road to get to the main strip (although why you'd leave your villa is beyond me). We nearly fell over backwards when they walked us inside the gate. Fantastic.",Bhavana Private Villas
216,Loved it!,50,August 2008,"We stayed at the Aston Bhavana Villas (formerly Sesari Villas) for 7 nights and thought it was fabulous. We stayed at the Padma in a deluxe chalet for the first 7 nights of our trip and went and looked at Aston Bhavana Villas on the second day to make sure it was ok. We wanted to move in as soon as possible – it was beautiful! I was so happy and excited and couldn’t wait to check in. I have always been a big fan of the Padma but won’t be staying there again. Why would you when you can stay at the Aston Bhavana Villas for around the same price and have privacy and all that space to yourself?!

We thought the staff were lovely and it was great having someone come and cook breakfast for you every morning. Yes, the road leading to it isn’t good but it’s the same as the pavements in most areas of Bali so don’t let that put you off. It’s a 5 minute walk from the Villas up to Laksmana. Ultimo restaurant (which is fabulous) is right on the corner. Heaps of great restaurants along that strip and fantastic boutiques.

It was very clean, the outdoor bathroom is beautiful. The whole place has a real calming vibe about it. When we arrived they showed us around the Villa, the stereo had Balinese music playing and it was so relaxing. We lay down on the day beds and fell asleep instantly for about 2 hours! We never take naps and didn’t feel tired as we’d already been in Bali for 7 days – but as I said, it is just so relaxing there.

Only one negative – we stayed in Villa 1 which is right near the reception area. The lights are kept on all night and our bedroom wasn’t as dark as I would have liked. Next time I will be requesting a room much further away from Reception.

The staff came in every night to light mosquito coils and spray the bedroom however I still got bitten while I was sleeping. That’s my fault though, next time I will put mosquito repellent on before I go to bed.

I highly recommend Aston Bhavana Villas and will be staying there again!",Bhavana Private Villas
217,Sesari Villa Just Great,40,July 2008,"First off ,a GOLD STAR ,to all the staff,they were just great.
We found the villa to be very clean and the breakfast ,well just staying there for that is well worth the price.
About a 5 min walk to the main street ,so its rather handy to everything.
I know that you will enjoy your stay ,and we will be staying there again.

218,"Excellent Service, Lovely accomadation",50,June 2008,"Just returned from a 7 day stay at the Sesari Bali for our honeymoon.
I was bemused before i went as it had slipped down the ranks prior to going and the room reports were excellent generally. but occasionally quite damming.
One thing I kept seeing get mentioned was the poor condition of the road leading to it, some saying they had to get a taxi everytime because it was so bad - what rubbish - i walked in daily with my wife in variuos levels of intoxication, and no, its not the best, but only like numerous similar roads throughout the Uk.
The pavements in Seminyak high street, or lack of them are more of a problem!
Bali is cheap as chips, unless you go to one of the seafront hotels, but generally a meal for two without wine is about £14, three course. The food is generally brilliant wherever you go.
One recommendation i'd have for the Sesari on booking isask for an odd numbered room, we switched to Villa three from 12 as it lacked Sun and were glad we did. Don't get me wrong, both rooms were immaculate, but the odd ones get more sun as on opposite side of site.
The staff come in every morning and cook you brakfast, then make your room, then come and remake and spray it in the evening, they are all excellent and never hang around or ask for tips. It was my partners birthday when we were out there and they gave her a bottle of wine and all the staff, even though she hadn't met some before always seemed to know our names and that it was her birthday.
Some rooms we're being refitted whislt we we're there, so maybe that explains some of previous comments, but overall i struggle to fault our stay there, although i would say competition is high with similar properties, so review all first before making your final choice.",Bhavana Private Villas
219,"""A true Sanctuary""",50,April 2008,"We have just arrived home from a 6 day stay at the Sesari Bali. My husband and I, we stayed in a double-Villa with our friends (another couple). I have to say, that the concept was just great! Both couples had a private bedroom with a bathroom, but shared the ""living area"" and the pool in the middle. We had so much more fun toghether than we would have if we'd stayed in a hotel.

We thought that it was fantastic that the breakfast was served in the villa every morning. Every evening we filled in the list and time for breakfast to be served. And, food was very nice.

Above all, all staff members were extemely friendly and the service was fast. There was also a good security in place.

We tried out the spa services, which were very reasonably priced and relaxing. I can absolutely recommend the 60-minute Indonesian massage.

The pool was quite small, but deep, so we even played waterball. High walls between Villas make sure that your neibourghs cannot take a peak into your Villa, so the place is a real sanctuary! :)

If you're looking at something different than a business hotel, this is it. And, it's even better when you can share it with your friends!!

What we disliked, was the road leading to the Sesari Bali. It was in a real bad shape, but according to daily papers that's the case in many places in Indonesia.",Bhavana Private Villas
220,Great hotel but....,40,March 2008,"There were 4 of us all girls, getting together for a girls holiday of sun, relaxation, food and of course shopping.
Given the range of accommodation in Seminyak, we too were confused as to which resort to go for or choose. We were looking for a gorgeous villa with a pool, great service and good accessibility to restaurants and shops. Sesari fulfilled most of our expectations with the exception of the location. As we had no car we relied upon our feet.
The villa’s are in a pretty desolate alley of Bali. It is not close to the beach at all. In addition, the roads to the hotel are horrendous which means you cannot walk anywhere and will be dependent on taxi for your full stay. We did try to walk at night with torches but this really was taking your life into your own hands as you could end up down a pot hole and not be found for a few day’s. I know this is not the fault of the hotel but something really needs to be done about these roads as people will stop coming if the roads are not fixed up. You have to cab it everywhere, even to the main road.

The pool was great in fact the whole room was great I have never had so much room to stay in. The bathroom was beautiful and so much space to hang my clothes, service was fantastic and friendly. If ever we needed something fixed it was done on that same day. They cooked breakfast for us each morning in the villa. It was yummy I think I tried everything on the menu and it was all good. Try the Banana and strawberry mixed juice to die for. An extra bonus we had a late check out to 6.00 pm and they allowed us to use one of the rooms (we had 2x2 villa rooms) until 09:00 pm at no extra cost.

I would stay again but the road would need to be fixed first. If you could move this property to Sanur you would have the perfect holiday.",Bhavana Private Villas
221,Didn't live up to expectations!,20,March 2008,"Just arrived back from an 11 day honeymoon staying at Sesari. Overall the villas were ok, but I was really hoping I'd be able to say they were great. For such a new establishment the villa we stayed in really needed some maintenance work, i.e. new paint job, pool decking restained, fix pool waterfall and clean tiling all around pool, new soap dish in shower (completely rusted) also the kitchen pretty much needs replacing as it is open air and the rain has water damaged the cupboards. The kitchen is not very hygenic and I would always wash any utensil I used with boiling water as I saw the cloths they used to wash the dishes (need I say more).... The TV reception was pretty bad and we had to get a new DVD player as our first one only played some DVD's. Satellite TV is pretty useless as most of the channels are asian so if you want TV entertainment buy some DVD's.

We booked the seafood candlelight dinner in our room for the first night of our stay and it was the most dissapointing experience we had in bali. It cost approx. AUD$120- which is not cheap and everything was terrible. The meal was 30mins late and noone came to let us know what was happening. Noone lit the candles, the wine was terrible, no choice of even red or white wine and we weren't even given a wine bucket and didn't even receive the wine until after mains were served (so we didn't drink it that night), and the seafood was cold and tough, I could go on about this meal but you get the picture.

Breakfast was ok, but we ate out a few times and that was when we remembered what it was like to eat a good breakfast. I mainly ordered the museli as there wasn't too much choice.

On the bright side, the staff were all very friendly, the bed and pillows were really comfy. It is in a pretty good location (apart from the entrance road) as it's close to lots of eateries. We hired a scooter for most of our stay so the road wasn't too big a deal but I certainly wouldn't have wanted to walk up it at night so it's not too convenient if you want to walk out for dinner. It was fantastic having our private pool, a real highlight.

I would love to say Sesari was fantastic as I looked at a lot of villas when booking our honeymoon, but unfortunately I can only say the level of accommodation is average, I would rate it 31/2 stars, and if they don't pay major attention to maintenance then it will not be a place you would want to stay at in the near future.",Bhavana Private Villas
222,Complete relaxation,50,March 2008,"This was our first stay in a villa and we were unsure what to expect. The first 7 nights of our trip were spent at the Bali Padma then we had 3 nights at the Sesari. In hindsight I wish we had more time at the Sesari.

The Villas are spectacular. Lazing by your own private pool was great. All the furniture is first class. The staff are all more than helpful. We had a late flight out and although we couldnt stay in our villa until 9pm as someone else was checking in that day, they arranged another vacant villa for us to spend the afternoon in whilst we waited for our flight (no charge).

I highly recommend the candle lit dinner. Very romantic.

The only negatives I have of this hotel are:
1. Location: It is on a very rough road in a bit of a nowwhere area. No real problem tho as you are only a 5 min walk to many restraunts
2. There are a few minor signs on wear in the outdoor areas of the villas

Overall I would recommend this villa to anyone (particularly couples)",Bhavana Private Villas
223,Okay but would stay somewhere else,10,March 2008,"I would not stay at this villa again and you can do better at some other places in Bali. The major problems for me were:

1. Accommodation – Our villa was in a state of despair with half of the lights broken and the waterfall not functioning.
2. Service – The service was extremely slow and inept at best. The hotel driver was 45 minutes late in picking us up at the airport. We tried to get them to fix our lights as half were broken and they did not fix it till literally the last day of our stay. In addition, in the process of fixing our waterfall for the pool, the maintenance guy left the water hose on for the full night as well as the gate to my villa wide open. Luckily for them, I had awaken up at about 2am and went outside to see that the pool was on the verge of overflowing because of this mistake and called them to turn it off. I could only imagine what would of happen if I did not discover this prior to the next morning.
3. Location – This villa is in a pretty desolate alley of Bali. It is not close to the beach at all. In addition, the roads to the hotel are horrendous which means you cannot walk anywhere and will be dependent on taxi for your full stay.

Bottom line is I would STRONGLY suggest not staying here as the service is horrible. There are so many other villas in Bali to choose from so don’t waste your time here.",Bhavana Private Villas
224,Gorgeous villas,50,November 2007,"Given the range of accommodation available in Seminyak, I too, like most of you, was confused as to which resort to go in for. I was looking for a a gorgeous villa with a pool, great service, good accessibility to restaurants and privacy. And Sesari fulfills all the criterion's.

Accommodation: One of the best rooms I have ever stayed in. Believe me, it's coming from a reviewer who has stayed in the likes of Ritz Carlton, Shangri - la and so on. The high walled villa has its own garden, private pool, a bedroom with poster beds, a living room, a small kitchenette and an outdoor bathroom. The garden is perfectly manicured, the pool is well maintained, the high ceiled living room is airy, the bedroom is cozy, the outdoor bathroom is awesome. To sum it up, full marks to the accommodation at Sesari.

Service: People in Bali are one of the warmest. They are extremely polite and genuine. They go out of the way to make you feel special. So is the staff at Sesari. One of the best things I like about Sesari is the free airport drop and pick up. They also provide free drops to the nearby restaurants as well as to the beach. Even if you book through a third party website/agent you can e-mail them your flight details and they will provide a free pick up.

Restaurants: Seminyak is home to some of the finest restaurants in the world. Living room is the best of them all. Go and catch the sunset at the bar - Kudeta. Walk along the eat street and jump into one of the many eateries.

As a destination, Bali is unbelievable. It's a combination of high end accommodation, warmth of the people, fantastic food, all for a very reasonable price. Don't hesitate, just go there!!!",Bhavana Private Villas
225,"Great villas, location could be better.",40,February 2008,"We had the 2BR villa with friends. The villa was great. Wifi access is available for free in the lobby. No internet in the villas themselves. And they did pick us up from the airport, included in cost of stay.

The pool was great, chilly but refreshing with a beautiful waterfall. The rooms were large, and the outdoor bathrooms were also great.

They cooked breakfast for us each morning in the villa. It was yummy, definitely get the mixed juice.

The only complaint is the location of the Sesari. It is on a side street which is kind of nice, however, the road is so crappy, you can't really walk it. You have to cab it everywhere, even to the main road.

We did have them set up a driver for us to go to the area beaches. They got us Putu, he was great. Ask for him!!",Bhavana Private Villas
226,Paradise Found,40,December 2007,"Sesari proved to be everything it said on both it's website and on tripadvisor, a true paradise. It is located on a side street off of a main street which is nice not to be right in the hussle bussle of the touristy town of seminyak. It's really hard to capture the beauty of where sesari is located and it's grounds in photographs. I tried to take the best pictures while there but really you must be there to see and experience it's true beauty. We were at sesari for our honeymoon and upon arrival were upgraded to a two bedroom villa, villa #10, we had a huge pool and fabulous villa. The room service menu is amazing, all fresh ingredients and many options. I am still missing and craving their fabulous fruit shakes by the pool. The staff bends over backwards to make sure all of your needs are met, including the drivers. We found Seminyak to be a little more of a touristy town than Ubud and we really weren't looking to stay in such a touristy town however being at Sesari seemed to make everything seem ok. It's hard to put such a perfect place into words but take mine and the rest of the reviews on tripadvisor's word for it, this place it pretty darn nice :) Oh yeah, and well worth the price, sooo cheap, a week's stay and I think our bill came out to $800 US dollars, that included breakfast everyday, 2 massages, many orders of room service and tons of fruit shakes, can't beat that in my opinion!",Bhavana Private Villas
227,Fantastic!,50,November 2007,"Have just come back from a week staying in these wonderful villas. Also a travel agent and found whilst searching for a private viilla for a much needed catch up with husband. The photos are completely accurate and this is probably one of the nicest properties I have had the pleasure of staying in.
Will thoroughly recommend. Room service menu is excellent as are the cooked breakfasts. We did get confused a few times with the knocking on the door and it was the villa opposite.
Staff delightful.",Bhavana Private Villas
228,Loved it,50,September 2007,"My husband and I stayed at Sesari in mid September 07 for our 10th wedding anniversary. It exceeded all expectations.
We were so impressed with everything. The accomodation was outstanding particularly the privacy of the villas, the only time we heard or saw other guests was at reception.
The outdoor bathroom was also beautiful as was the decor of the villa.
We loved the pool which we considered to be huge for two people. The staff were very discreet and cooked a mean brekky every morning at a time nominated by us.
We ate at some great places in Seminyak including Kudeta and La Lucciola which are just a short, pleasant walk from Sesari.
We will definetly be visiting Sesari again.",Bhavana Private Villas
229,Perfect for a Real Honeymoon,50,August 2007,"My new wife and I stayed at the Sesari Bali for 7 nights beginning on
August 4. The rate that we booked included complimentary aiport transfer (a welcomed benefit after being in transit for nearly 20 hours from Los Angeles). The driver brought us bottled water and the drive took about 30 minutes through the congested and extraordinarily
confusing roads of Denpasar and its environs.

The villas is located in what is pretty clearly the new touristy part
of Bali. There appears to be a large expat community in Seminyak and the myriad of high-end restaurants, charming boutiques, and several well-guarded villa complexes (like the Sesari) prove it. It is the
""up and coming"" part of Bali, however, so dwellers should be aware that stray dogs, litter and a patchwork of zoning have led to Seminyak's current identity crisis - luxurious villas sit next to empty lots or rice fields. Famiy dwellings that have been there for seemingly centuries are built near restaurants boasting modern decor. The area is truly charming and the meals in most of the restaurants were extraordinary especially for the price paid - my wife and I ate 3-4 course meals with wine (don't drink the local wine
- Hatten - it tastes like chlorine) for under $20 USD per person
- service and everything included.

The villa complex is located approximately 100 meters from the main thoroughfare in Seminyak - so it's off the beaten path and road noise
is not a problem. The exterior is a bit fortress-like (there is an obvious concern for the appearance of security throughout the island), but you quickly enter into the main lobby which is surrounded by a moat and decorated in a modern balinese style - think
lots of cushy square pillows, straight line design, and shiny tile. Check-in was smooth (if slightly slow - maybe a 10 minute process) and we were quickly escorted to our private villa by one of the friendliest people on staff.

We were shown our villa and the staff person, after a five minute tour, quickly left. The villa was spacious, had a fully functional air conditioner for the bedroom, and a large outdoor space that was warm but certainly comfortable and ideal for the August weather. The bed was comfortable, robes were provided, and the outside bathroom was really cool. The images on the official website don't do it justice and I'll try to post some images of the space if I have time
- the room is awesome.

The service was great. The minibar is a little expensive (as always),
but they told us there was a circle k convenience store down the street for snacks and low-priced beer. The refrigerator was small and
it was a bit overpacked - so much so that we broke a few bottles when
opening it. But the staff was very kind and quickly cleaned it without charges us for the product. Everyone was extremely friendly, polite, and respectful of our privacy. The room service prices were reasonable, but the food wasn't very good - so a good meal for the first night when we just wanted to fill up and go to sleep after the flight, but we didn't order it frequently. Sandwiches were the equivalent of $6 USD - so not outrageous.

We has a minor problem with our plumbing and they quickly moved us into the two bedroom villa - which was even more amazing. Neither pool was heated, but the weather is so warm it's refreshing to have them be so cool. Don't count on sun bathing for too long though - each villa is surrounded by a 15 foot wall that will block the sun except during mid-day.

I went into the location at length above - but tourists should be aware that the villa complex is not like a standard hotel - it's away from the business of the area, one must walk outside of the complex to do anything - but it's a very short walk and good to get the fresh air. The streets aren't paved generally, so you are walking on a dirt road. But please don't confuse lack of infrastructure and other signs of poverty as symptoms of this developing island's crime rate. My wife and I felt completely safe walking down the street and cabs are plentiful in the area. Seminyak is small enough that you shouldn't need a cab.

The villa had a list of several guided tours around the island and my wife and I took one of those - on a rainy day - but the driver made the best of it. He was friendly, tried very hard to speak English (we got along fine) and courteous. The monkey forest was fun.

The villa also had a book of local restaurants that it recommended - we tried several of them but my favorite was Warung Sobat - a ten minute cab ride (or if you're nice the driver might take you for a small tip) to this local establishment gets you an extensive and cheap wine list, local food, and lots of character. Watch out for the
mosquitoes in the bathroom though. Even with a couple of mosquito bites, the food was well worth it.

Also, note that the villas does its best to eliminate the possibility
of you getting mosquito bites; they spray the room once a night and the bed has a mosquito net on it.

It's probably too far of a walk to the beach to do it daily and the waves seemed to be closing out a bit too quickly and close to shore for my blood. The water was also a darker color and near some polluted fresh water pools that made it appear to be dirty although I saw many people swimming in it. Kuta was a better beach to learn to surf or to go and be in the crowd - but that beach is so touristy that Seminyak was definitely the right choice and Sesari was a great place to stay!

I also got a good rate - it worked out to around $100 USD per night with a free night that I got for staying 6 nights. For a private villa in an area that was so inexpensive, it was great!",Bhavana Private Villas
230,Gorgeous!!,50,August 2007,"We have recently returned from 7 wonderful nights at Sesari Bali. This is one of those places that you can believe what you see on their website. These villas are gorgeous.

We were a group of 9 friends and between us had 1 and 2 bedroom villas. All were just lovely. Each villa had its own pool which were very generous in size. The outdoor bathrooms were beautiful. Each bedroom was fully air-conditioned and sealed off to the open air, so there was no problem with mozzie attacks during the night. What's more the staff came around each evening and lit the coils, sprayed the rooms and turned down the beds.

Each morning, at the time we specified the staff came to our villa and cooked our delicious breakfast. The banana smoothies are great! Our table would be set beautifully and then we would be left to enjoy our delicious breakfast. The best part was dialling ""0"" when finished and in they would come to clear all the dishes away (I've tried this at home...but nothing happens!!).

All of the staff were incredible and most helpful. The villas have their own car and were happy to take us to wherever we needed to go...even into Kuta one night for dinner. They even took us to an excellent money changer. Go with their recommendations and beware of the money changers on Laksmana just across from Ultimo restaurant.

Speaking of which, Ultimo is a great place to eat and wonderful value. Another goody is a new one called Grocer & Grind on jl. kayu jati. A little bit further is Hu'u which is fabulous and across from that the Living Room. If you want something really romantic for dinner and out of this world then go to The Breeze at Samaya (next door to Ku de Ta ). You will have to pay a bit more, but it is well worth it, the food and the situation are world class!!

None of our group would hesitate to return to Sesari. It is as it says ""Affordable Luxury"". Stay there....you won't be sorry.",Bhavana Private Villas
231,What a magic holiday,50,July 2007,When looked at the photos for the one bedroom villa I didn't allow myself to get too excited just in case it was nothing like the pictures. As we walked in I stood in shock realising how gorgeous our villa and holiday was going to be. The room was so lovely and extremely clean and the pool.. yes a lot bigger than a plunge pool was just amazing. It was the best place I have ever experienced in bali. My husband and I like our privacy to unwind and this place exceeded our expectations.. It is maintained on a daily basis and the ever so friendly staff make the difference.. Looked fwd to the breakfast each day.. This is going to be our place to rest and enjoy Bali each time we visit.,Bhavana Private Villas
232,balmy private paradise,50,July 2007,"This was the best hotel experience of my life. These beautiful villas are decked out in modern Balinese furniture and provide ample room for any couple to laze through balmy Bali days and nights. I was very impressed with the stylish décor and the indoor/outdoor living concept: the sofas, dining table and kitchen are outdoors, the bedroom indoors and the lavish bathroom outdoors but secluded by high walls. Rice paddies border the complex but it’s located close to most of Seminyak’s chic venues in a lane just off ‘East Street’. Unfortunately the well used road is unpaved, dirty and unlit so cabs by night are a must for the squeamish. Room service food quality is very high. Breakfast cooked in your villa each morning is a novelty but after a while it detracts from the privacy a little. Then again, each villa has a pool in the courtyard which makes up for everything and we barely left the serenity of our villa the entire time we were in Seminyak. The staff are so friendly and they even allowed us to check out at 18:00 rather than 14:00. Beautiful, stylish and unbelievable value for money.",Bhavana Private Villas
233,"Beautiful, luxurious villas",50,May 2007,"We found out about Sesari Bali through TripAdvisor, then contacte the place direct to book.

We stayed there for 2 nights and wish we could have stayed longer. The villas are spacious and beautifully designed, in a modern Balinese style. Our villa was completely private, with their own swimming pool, indoor-outdoor bathroom, air-conditioned bedroom, and indoor-outdoor living area. It's a lovely sanctuary from the hectic streets outside.

Location is great - a short walk to the shops and restaurants of Seminyak. The beach was a little further, but Sesari Bali offers a car and driver to drop you off anywhere nearby if you don't feel like walking -- the car is new and spacious, and the none of the drivers we had drove like madmen. Airport transfers were included in the price, using the same nice car and driver.

The reception staff are gracious, and very helpful with booking us reservations at spas, restaurants, etc. They even recommended a money changer they trusted -- who turned out to be the only one that didn't try to cheat us during our stay.

There is in-room dining service, and a well-stocked mini-bar. Prices for these were very fair -- nothing like the inflated prices you find in many hotels.

The best bit was the staff came to our villa and cooked us breakfast (included in the price) each morning -- very decadent!

We hope that Sesari Bali stays as beautiful, friendly, and well-maintained as it is now, because we'll definitely be returning next year.",Bhavana Private Villas
234,Reasonably priced luxury !!,50,October 2006,"After three months of trying to find the perfect hotel in Bali, I finally say this tiny little link on trip advisor which took me to the Sesari website advertising brand new luxury villas with our own pool at half price for a soft opening. This I thought was too good to be true. When I booked it direct I asked about any hidden or extra charges and there simply werent any.

The Villas are just gorgeous, they really feel like your own peice of paradise and are very priviate, you can lock your door and just chill by your own pool.

The service is good but takes a little getting used to, breakfast is literally served cooked and served in your villa's kitchen everyday.
It's like having your own staff, by the end of the holiday we had gotten bored of the breakfast menu and would have given anything to cook our own food.

The room service menu however is extensive and always extremely tasty!

There isnt a lot to do in Seminyak - there are some good restaurants and the villas are about a 5 minute walk away from 'Eat street'

You HAVE to go and have a drink at Ku De Ta - it is a must and is possibly THE most chilled out place in Bali - I loved sipping cocktails on sun loungers watching the sun go down over the beach.

I would highly recommend Sesari Bali Villas, especially for that romantic getaway.
