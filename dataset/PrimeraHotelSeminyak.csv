0,Nice hotel but far from beach and was noisy when ppl walked by too,30,May 2023,"Staff were friendly, room was good how ever had a balcony but couldn’t use it as there was no door to get out to it. Hotel is far from the beach. People were noisy as they talked and walked by your room. Pool was nice but not very deep.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1,OK for one or two nights,30,April 2023,"Our villa was canceled last minute and we needed somewhere convenient to stay.

-3.6% charge of credit card that I was not aware of until after I paid
-bathroom smelt of cat wee
- decent coffee extra at breakfast and rather than being able to put on room they continually harass you for payment.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2,Ramada-April 2023,50,April 2023,"My husband and I stayed at Ramada for approximately 2 weeks. Nice and quiet room, food at the restaurant very good. Staff very helpful and always smiling.

4,Great pool,30,February 2023,"A great hotel for relaxing by the pool. We stayed for a couple of nights at the end of our holiday, our first Western Styled accommodation in Bali.

The Ramada Encore is set away from things, so need a taxi to go and and explore. It’s location is great for those who prefer being away from the touristy shopping areas.

Our room was nice with a comfy bed and balcony. Has tea / coffee making facilities, a decent sized fridge and a hot plate for cooking.

A let down for me was having to pay everything as you used / ordered it. Which meant I always had to carry cash or card anywhere in the hotel. Not a big issue, just inconvenient.

Staff were friendly and helpful.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
5,Great hotel,50,March 2023,"A very nice hotel. The breakfast buffet is very varied and good. Nice pool prices are very reasonable. Employees demand immediate payment for extra food and alcohol. It's not nice to get paid right away. It might be better to register with a room number and make a lump sum payment at the hotel checkout because many well-known hotels in many countries use this system and it's great. Rooms are clean and cleaned daily. It is nice to have a gym, the necessary sports equipment is available. The garden room is nice as access to the pool is easy. The pool is constantly cleaned. The taxi in front of the hotel is also very helpful. Motor and vehicle park are available. The location of the hotel is nice.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
6,Don’t book Ramada encore bali,10,February 2023,"I stayed at the Ramada encore which I am not recommending.

On the first night at 9:00p the room experienced a power failure and after investigation the problem could not be remedied and we had to be moved. The hotel said they would give us a new room and upgraded room overlooking pool, I have never experienced this sort of thing but okay. It was pouring rain.

We moved to new room at 9:30p and went to bed shortly thereafter. I woke up after midnight to find the floor covered in water, not just a little area the entire room. The hotel puts this down to condensation. This is too much!! On top of it all this hotel is not in a good location you must take grab to go anywhere it’s a long walk to shops!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
7,Very good hotel,40,February 2023,"We have just spent 15 nights at this resort. The only negative is that it is a bit removed from the main area of Seminyak. It is either a 20-30 minute walk or a 40-50k rupiah taxi trip. Other than that we could not fault it. All the staff from the front desk, the room attendants, pool attendants and restaurant were incredibly friendly and helpful. Congratulations to them all and also hotel management for maintaining such a high level of staff engagement. The pool is fantastic and certainly large enough that you never felt crowded, plenty of sun beds and a great selection of food cuisines are available at the restaurant",Primera Hotel Seminyak
8,Best bar asssist by Mr.Micky.,50,January 2023,Good and nive hotel environment. Bar looking good. Mr.Micky welcome with more respect and have a pleasend drink at bar. Mr.Micky nice and good bar assistant. I'm really enjoying have drink at bar by assist ny Mr.Micky.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
9,Service,50,February 2023,"Its my first visit to Bali,and im having a good time here with such a warm welcome and helpful person Mr Micky for his good support.Im enjoyed my visit here at Ramada Encore hotel,YOU WON'T REGRET ONCE CHECKED IN HERE!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
10,Worst hotel I’ve ever known,10,December 2022,"I stayed in this hotel for 20 days based on my friend’s recommendation. I booked this hotel for 2 rooms through booking.com. 1 room for 14Dec-3Jan and 1 room for 14-21 Dec.
Unfortunately, my parents had problem for traveling and cannot come to Bali. So 1 room for 14-21 Dec I have to cancel it. Then I went to booking.com and cancel the reservation. However, the booking.com notified me that the cancellation fee can be waived based on the hotel approval. So, I talked to Evelyn and she said the reservation must be charged based on booking.com policy. I have no words, when booking.com said it based on flexibility of the hotel. But hotel must charge it because of the booking.com policy. Anyway, not a big deal. After that, we received message from HOTEL that they charged me the cancellation fee for first night. They said, hotel charge it, but they cannot give us the invoice.
During our stay, we had unpleasant experiences.
1. The bathroom was very stinky. Called FO and asked someone to check it. ENG was checking our room but he did nothing. And asked me to put the fan on. We had smell rooms for many days. I asked housekeeping to do something and finally he did something and put air refreshner in the bathroom.
2. I do not feel safe during my stay. 1 time I saw 2 suspicious old ladies strolling around the corridor and waiting in front of the hotel’s room (from 1 room to another room). Everybody can access to all floors without card.
3. 1 time, My partner was staying in the room. And 1 employee was entering the room, he said someone was calling them and asking for key access when nobody was asking.
4. Receptionist mentioned our room number in front of other guests. In my opinion, they shouldn’t mention room number in front of other guest to protect our privacy.
5. I was asking for concierge assistance to send my package from lobby to my room. However they refused with reason : no staff to do it.
6. Breakfast foods was boring. Stayed for 20 days with same foods everyday. Tried dinner 1 time in the restaurant, and I never come back.
7. Hotel area area mastered by local taxi mafia. You cannot order taxi online from hotel or to hotel. Be careful if you do it, they will approach you at any time and ask you to go out from the car
8. I need invoice for my stay and the room that I cancelled. The receptionist and reservation said that they cannot issue the invoice as the hotel paid by travel agent. They refer me to contact booking.com. Meanwhile, we contacted booking.com and they said the hotel should provide the invoice, not them. I talked to duty manager with no solution. They keep asking me to contact booking.com. I dont know what to do, both of side cannot issue my invoice. I stayed there 20 days and they treat me like this. This is ridiculous. Low end service provided by them.
I do not recommended this hotel at all. Not worth for money for many reasons. There is alot of nice hotels around with similar price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
11,very bad staff,10,December 2022,"if you are staying in ramada you can not use online taxi app. you have to use taxi service with whom they have tie up, no matter how hefty amount they charge, if you refuse to use it you be ready to carry your luggage outside ramada approximately 1 Km. They will tell you its local law. we told them at least you send somebody from your staff with trolly to keep our luggage outside Hotel to which they refuse, if they want they can help their customers but they dont want. They get commission from the local taxi service. The guy who is there from local taxi service is so so rude, he does not even know how to talk to the tourist, he insults us and manager of Ramada was supporting him , very very very bad staff, employee and especillay the lady manager. Never Ever stay there.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
12,Good city hotel,40,December 2022,"Booked this hotel for our first two nights through AGODA on a non refundable rate. Unfortunately the flight got cancelled and we could stay there only for the second night. I sent a message from the Airport to inform that we couldn't arrive on day 1, received a reply that the original booking will hold but no refunds will be given. (Fair enough)

Pros:
Reception was great, very helpful. All smiley faces.
All the staff in other areas were very pleasant.
Rooms: clean & comfy.
Breakfast: Very extensive layout for buffet including live egg / pasta stations
Dinner: Mostly good, except for the mee goreng which was too salty /too much soy sauce I guess.
Free shuttle from the hotel to Seminyak at 10am to return at 4 pm
Spa, gym, pools

Cons:
Hotel is not close to any shops, beaches, attractions etc.
A typical city hotel with no space to take a walk inside the hotel premises. Even the pools are in very close proximity to the buildings.
They allow smoking in the restaurant...Many smokers in the restaurant at dinner time.. ruined my dinner experience ( Had a sign prohibitting smoking there during breakfast- would have been great if they prohibit smoking in the restaurant totally)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
13,10/10 service and Amazing bartenders,50,December 2022,"The bartenders here at the bar is very friendly. Eka Antara, Triyani ,Aditya ,Alex ,Eva ,dwi , Tika are the best bartenders I’ve met. Even in America the service is not as good as this place. Very kind and communicative and the service is impeccable. Would highly recommend staying at the Ramada hotel in Seminyak just for the service alone. Room is clean and nightlife is live here. Close to the beach and just the people here is what makes this place great. They treat everyone in a kind and friendly manner and easy to communicate with.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
14,Breakfast buffe 100k,50,October 2022,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel. All the staff at the hotel are very friendly and welcoming. We want to say special thank you to Ms. Party. She was very accommodating to our requests. We are vegetarian, she was very helpful in explaining the vegetarian menu at breakfast. Although the choice of vegetarian food is not much, but we enjoyed all of them. We will come to stay again. Please add the vegetarian options for breakfast",Primera Hotel Seminyak
15,Fantastic stay,50,October 2022,"Spending 3D2N at Ramadha Encore, and we had awesome experience here, specially for the room was absolutely fobulous and the breakfast was delightful. Thank you for the awesome service provided by parti. Cheers..!! Will come back to stay here in the future",Primera Hotel Seminyak
16,The most relaxing holiday.......ever,50,October 2022,"This was our 2nd visit to the Ramada encore, staying 6 days, in a pool access room.

Breakfast was included which had a wide selection of food to eat.. If you want a latte or cappuccino it is an extra $2- but the house drip filter is really really bad. The machine was down for 3 days and I think they use long life milk.😔

The room was well appointed, with a comfortable bed and the house keeping kept everything clean and replenished. The staff were helpful and polite.

The pool is magnificent and excellent size and provided lots of fun beds.

The couple of draw backs to this place is:

*It is about about a 20 minute walk to the shops which is not a straight walk and crossing roads we found a challenge as a zebra crossing means nothing.

*This place is isolated from everywhere else.... so you either have to walk or catch a taxi

*The breakfast menu is incredibly repetitive and they only had pineapple every second day and one day didn’t even have bananas one day.

*the staff were not as attentive as last visit and last time the staff k ew our names. Thus time it was like they had never seen us before. We were here 6 days????

* request bluebird taxi’s if you need to have a cab called from the hotel. One of their cabs drivers that they recommend charged us 4x’s the amount for the same distance that a bluebird metered driver charged. They say that the bluebird drivers will take 20 minutes to come. They ever only took about 3 minutes.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
17,Bad food experience,30,October 2022,"Overall its a good Hotel. But when it comes to food I would rate 1/5. So we ordered Indian food expecting to be perfect as there are a lot if Indians staying at this place. We ordered aloo Gobi matar and chicken butter masala, base of both the dishes were same. Which is not mentioned in the menu.

Secondly we had to wait for 30 min for parathas to come as first batch of parathas were raw so gad to send it back and then I received pitta bread again I had to send it back, then I receive my third batch which was again raw.
As a Michelin star chef I was highly disappointed with the food.

Breakfast I would rate it 4/5. Its a perfect blend of everything.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
18,5 star for food and stay,50,September 2022,"We stay here for the first and last stop, everything was perfect. I think this is the hotel with the biggest pool, and the breakfast was super tasty. Staff is always so nice especially PARTI. I really recomment this place. Looking forward to come back here❣️",Primera Hotel Seminyak
19,Large hotel with nice pool,40,November 2021,"Large hotel with nice pool.
The check-in took hours and staff not very helpful.
We requested and were approved an early check-in but did not happen upon arrival.
The rooms are spacious and they offer laundry service (paid).
The breakfast was great.
Good location from where you can easily walk to local areas.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
20,Been a while,30,September 2022,"Has been 6 years since we stayed here .
We opted for a pool side room, but it wasn’t jump off your door step into the pool . So I’m not sure why we were charged at the same rate ? . Should be classified as pool level .
The Resort itself has a Fair bit of wear and tear to what it was years ago , especially the rooms . We had a small bed for our young one , it was a bit dusty and sheets were dirty also . Missed the mark for price this time around as-well , will try elsewhere next time.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
21,Value for money,50,September 2022,"We stayed here overnight before moving onto our pre-booked accommodation. This was super cheap and convenient as we booked it only a few hours before arriving in Bali. We got the most simple room which was large and clean. We didn't explore the area, but I think it would be better to take a grab/taxi than walk from there. We ended up eating a buffet breakfast in the resort restaurant which was only $10 AUD. I would say this resort is excellent value for money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
22,Reptile zoo,10,August 2022,"There were many lizards in the hotel
You could see lizards everywhere around at night was totally disappointed
And when talked to staff they told they are not dangerous
Obviously we know that but who expects a hotel full of lizards during their vacation",Primera Hotel Seminyak
23,Great stay with friends,40,August 2022,Stayed here in August 2022. The hotel is value for money. Not On the beach But in a quiet street with massage parlors and shops. This place is a very nice place to sty. Staff are great and friendly. We had a pool side room. Just walk out the door and into the pool. Perfect. The Rooms Are a little dated put they are nice. Breakfast was the highlife. Fantastic. If you do not like a short walk into legion rd . The hotel will call you a bluebird. Just a nice place to stay.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
24,Never fails to amaze,50,August 2022,"So happy to be back in Bali and even happier to be back at the Ramada Encore.

When your flight lands at midnight you wrestle your way out the airport, make it into your awaiting transport and before you know it. You are sipping a cold beer, expertly made cocktail and have a feed. The 24 hour bar and dining options are the greatest way to start a holiday fresh off the plane.

The staff are always smiling and ready to assist no matter what time it is.

The rooms are spacious, and the aircon is Ice cold. If you find yourself fortunate enough to have TAMA as your house keeper you’re in luck. His attention to detail always happy to get you what ever you need. The artfully folded towels each day and personalised notes are a beautiful touch. My wife’s new best friend… for which I’m grateful for the ease of pressure…

Can not wait to return, Terima kasih dan sampai jumpa !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
25,Just OK,30,August 2022,"While we snapped up a bargain & booked months ago, we were still disappointed. We reserved a pool access room which was more like a pool side room. It was right next to the restaurant area, kids swimming area & quite noisy.
Room was ok but bathroom needed a good Renovation, or at the very least a good clean around the shower area. Breakfast was very average , I would suggest going out for breakfast.
Safe in room was faulty & our passports & money were locked in it until the supervisor came and unlocked it . After that we didn’t trust the safe .
They provide 1 towel each , no hand towel and no face washer. One of our towels were very slightly marked & they tried to charge us for the cleaning. They had not even tried washing it! charging us for marking their off white towel left a sour taste.
Concierge was very helpful. Taxis found it easy to find the hotel . Hotel is not located anywhere near the seminyak shopping or restaurant/bar area. But we never had difficulty in getting a taxi there or back.
Very family oriented, if you don’t want kids around- stay elsewhere. For the money we paid this experience was ok I guess but next time we would prefer to pay more and get better service & a better location. You get what you pay for. We paid about $70 a night for twin pool access room. pretty cheap so can’t expect perfection .",Primera Hotel Seminyak
26,Spacious accommodation and pool nice but very remote,30,July 2022,"Pool set up gorgeous - we on ground floor so swim up pool lovely. Accommodation great we had a 3 bed appt very spacious, however foul moist smell on arrival. Breakfast buffet okay but not very good at making fresh omelettes etc and every morning had to ask for butter: cutlery to be replenished as none -think maybe short staffed post covid?! Website said free shuttle bus but we were told $5 hotel taxi ride to Seminyak from reception. Room service was quite nice but tiny portions. Very remote hotel not much in walking distance.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
27,Room Description does not match in real,10,June 2022,Details mentioned in Make My Trip does not match in real. The hotel receptionist kept on repeating the same line when we complained about this. They did not compensate and instead started to blame MMT for this.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
28,Our second home,50,July 2022,"Really like our second home in Bali. Great swimming pool, good taste for break fast and nice atmosphere. With that rate, it's hard to find a place as comfortable as that. Just a little suggestion so that the car park can be made more spacious and comfortable",Primera Hotel Seminyak
29,Good hotel with Good service,40,July 2022,"Good house keeping staff and clean rooms. Nice stay at hotel.
Good breakfast with multiple options and supportive staff

Front desk staff are need improvement on assist customers experience.

Property is far from semainik beach but good location considering peaceful atmosphere.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
30,Not really pleasant,20,July 2022,"Hello, we are from room 3313 and 3314 for 30 june and 1 july, named Michael.
We are 5 people, so when whecked in , we bought an extra bed set for 3314 room and get 1 breakfast included for each day.
We didn't take the breakfast on 1 july morning becuse of our schedule to nusa penida.
But on 2nd July morning, my father want to get the breakfast that is included on the extra bed (he is alone going to restaurant as we only have 1 breakfast), but he is shocked when the waitress at restaurant said he has room only, and he is being outcasted right away.
He is humiliated as everyone watch him even after he explain we have 1 breakfast, the staff said he didn't.
Two hours later, when me as his child went down to reconfirm, the different reception DO SAY that we had the breakfast for 1 person.
We are so so so disappointed with the services like that.
How can your staff missed that detail?
How can they be so rude by outcasting my father right away at the restaurant when he IS RIGHTOUS TO CLAIM HIS BREAKFAST?
is that how you treat your customer?
We are not minded to pay idr 100,000 or even idr 1,000,000 for breakfast , but how your staff treat him is NEVER ACCEPTABLE.
We are so disappointed, and we surely will never recommend you to anyone, instead we will tell everyone to stay away from your place as it really gives us very bad memories.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
31,Dissapointing,20,June 2022,"Very disappointing stay in Ramada Encore. Ants and cockroaches in the toilet, serious shortage of towels, no discount given on f&b as mentioned in booking.com, Breakfast buffet is disappointing as well and very unstable WIFI to add the issues.

Although Helpfull staff in reception, bell desk and restaurant chefs at live counter very kind and helpful as well.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
32,Value for Money,50,June 2022,"This hotel provide a great pleasure, nice and clean room. The bathroom also no problem. Overall great stay. I will comeback again for sure. Also the swimming pool was great view and ambience. Realy value for money.Thank you",Primera Hotel Seminyak
33,Good,50,June 2022,"Nice hotel and helpful staff. Cleaning is done every day. breakfast is nice. The only problem is that when alcohol is taken from the bar, the payment is made immediately and the room is not registered. I can recommend it to everyone, the prices are very affordable and it is a clean, stylish hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
34,"Ramada encore by wyndham hotel, Seminyak, Bali",40,May 2022,"Ramada encore by wyndham hotel, at Seminyak, Bali
This is 4 star hotel, abit walk distance to Sunset Road, assume as exercises ...
The room quite big, very comfort bed/pillows, clean sheet ...
Good food for breakfast, with pool view, plenty of table/chair around the restaurant ...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
35,Ramada Hotel Sunset road,50,October 2021,Ramada hotel in Bali is in great location. It's on sunset road connecting the island from south to north. It's only 10min drive from airport. Hotel itself is very nice with clean rooms. Great stuff and very polite. You can rent motorbike right in hotel.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
36,Nice hotel but difficult access,30,January 2021,"This is my first time staying here, due to the crazy deal we got. we even got upgraded into a deluxe pool access, where the room have terrace and can access the large nice pool.

as i mention in the title, the hotel location is a bit hidden somewhere behind Sunset Road, not exactly in Seminyak as i imagine. quite far from the (not so) happening area of seminyak and even access to the nearest minimarket is quite far.

the room itself is clean, but the large bed, is actually 2 singles bed hence it is very uncomfortable with gap in the middle. and due to covid, they reduce the room make up service to cleaning every 2 days instead of every day. i understand they tried to lower the operational cost and limit human contact. other than cleaning, they also didnt provide the free mineral water bottles on my second night there. room's wall is also quite thin, as i can hear the people on the room beside me talking (or is it because we get connecting rooms?)

the property is huge and covid impact was minimum guests in the hotel, making it a bit scary. aside from the amazing room price, i might not consider myself to go back here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
37,Nice hotel,40,October 2020,"This is our second time back to this hotel. We stayed in the family room with 3 bedrooms, kitchen, and living room. Kitchen is fully equipped with cooking utensils and cutleries.
We really like the family room here, aside the reasonable price, I think its the best family room compared to other hotel.
The pool is quite big but sadly due to Covid, the hotel area is very quiet. Its not like last time we stayed, there was music in the restaurant, so it was nice to chill by the pool or just playing billiard next to the restaurant.
Before Covid, the breakfast was buffet and the choices are super. They even have Indian section which I rarely see in other hotels. But now they only served a la carte breakfast and the restaurant itself looks like closed.
Overall, we would still like to stay there again but maybe not with the quiet atmosphere.
Hopefully Covid goes away soon",Primera Hotel Seminyak
38,The best breakfast and best breakfast location,50,November 2019,"The most delightful about the trip was the really nice breakfast by the pool
Lots of variety , delicious fruits , delicious noodles , waffle and wide variety of juices .
The room was pool view and had a balcony .
The staff were welcoming .",Primera Hotel Seminyak
39,Relaxing hotel in a busy district,40,March 2020,"We stayed seven nights in this hotel, The Staff were very polite, the rooms were clean, the pool area was maintained throughout the day. The breakfast was very good, curry for breakfast was a new one for us but it was very tasty. The only downside was its location along an unmade road but don't let this put you off, just a little muddy when walking after rainfall. Would definitely go back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
40,Fabulous,50,March 2020,"When we arrived at the hotel check in was swift and efficient. We asked if our room was a pool view which unfortunately it wasn’t, to upgrade to a pool view room was another £140 for 10 days but the lady said we had a balcony so we decided to save our money. Our bags were taken to our superior room by a lovely young chap. Wow, sooooo disappointing !!!!! There was a balcony which you could only access through a window and if your entire body was no thicker than 1 inch !!!! The view was of some waste ground behind the hotel.
We called reception to ask if we could view the pool view room, and within 15 minutes we were all settled in our beautiful new room.
The bed was ENORMOUS and soooooo comfortable, the bathroom was efficient with the amenities replenished daily.
The hotel facilities were all we could ask for, the pool beautifully clean....as was everywhere in the hotel. There was a kiosk by the pool for towels that were thick and fluffy. Plenty of sun beds and tables if you fancied sitting in the shade for drinks or a snack. Fabulous cocktails and beer bucket deals (expensive compared to outside the hotel....but hotel prices whatddya gonna do)
Breakfast was amazing and more than plentiful but so random .....cereals......pancakes.....lasagne.....Thai green curry and teppanyaki noodles !!!!! I suppose they are catering for all cultures so after a day or 2 of sticking to boring British style breakfasts we embraced the randomness. Nasi goreng with salt n pepper chicken was just what we needed after a night on the bintangs.
The location of the hotel is ok, you’re close to a multitude of brilliant bars and restaurants but a good distance from the beach so we hired a scooter. I’d definitely recommend one but the roads are utter madness and quite scary to begin with but after a few miles you kinda get the hang of it.
I could not fault this hotel after our room change and would definitely stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
41,Fabulous,50,May 2019,"We had a pool access room, close to the admin area. It was our favourite hotel in Bali out of the 5 we have stayed at. The lagoon pool is spectacular. It's not near shopping but the hotel run a shuttle bus for guests. We were going back this March but have had to cancel for the moment. Can't wait to go back soon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
42,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Staff!",40,March 2020,"I must admit, there was only one small thing that stopped me giving this hotel an excellent review.

I arrived in the Tuesday and checked into room 3216, I spent 2 nights in this room and both mornings I was waking up to headaches not to mention how bad the room was smelling. I discovered that this was because of the mould and damp in the room. Not surprising though giving how humid Bali was.

We ran into the Guest Relations Officer in the lift and I mentioned this to her. I was moved to another room which was a pool view room with a balcony which was a much better room.

The room was a lot better and there was no issues with this room at all.

I spent the next 7 nights in this room and I slept so well.

The pool was awesome. It was so good just to relax poolside and sunbathe and then enjoy a swim.

The service from the staff was something else, nothing was too much trouble for them and they would always bring it to you something that was greatly appreciated as it meant you could just relax.

Breakfast, this took a bit to getting used to. Seeing items at breakfast you’d normally have for dinner but I had to appreciate that I was in another Country and the cultures where completely different. Eggs and bacon where made order and I got used to having noodles for breakfast and my breakfast wasn’t complete without them. The best part about breakfast though was the freshly made waffles and pancakes. Breakfast wasn’t the same on the days without them.

Dinner was just as great and experience as breakfast.

I also took 3 hours out my day to experience a cleopatra spa package in the hotel spa. There was parts where I forgot I was having a massage as I generally felt like I was floating on water a lot which is how great the massage was.

The only thing that was really sad to see was how affected the hotel was by the recent coronavirus outbreak. At one point we were made aware that the hotel had 290 rooms and only 39 occupied the hotel. It was clearly having and impact and it wasn’t nice to see. I really hope things pick up for the staff.

When I next come to Bali I would definitely stay at this hotel again. I would however avoid rooms 3212, 3214 and 3216 until they sort the little issue out I had.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
43,Loved It,50,March 2020,"Stayed for 6 nights wish we stayed longer, Rooms are very clean, Thanks to Dewi for your amazing customer service, There was an issue with my booking payment with agoda and staff were very helpful to try and fix it for us will never book with agoda again, Pool is huge and refreshing, Best buffet breakfast great variety, Food in restaurant have the best pork ribs ever. Can't wait to stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
44,Good property,50,March 2020,I stayed there for 5 days..I liked the hotel and the amenities.. special mention to ms.Indah..she was very cooperative and very jolly girl..she took care of all the guests in the restaurant..she was very friendly and very good person..,Primera Hotel Seminyak
45,Hotel stay,50,March 2020,"Great Hotel friendly staff very clean .
The only thing I found it was to far from Seminyak centre it was about a 5 km walk to get into town so we got a cab all the time about $3.00 dollars Australian each way
And there were heaps of kids staying as well so no peace by the pool .",Primera Hotel Seminyak

57,Nice trip to Seminyak,40,January 2020,"My first stay in Seminyak, and this hotel is great value. Not particularly near the hustle and bustle of Seminyak itself, and not walkable into town, so you have to rely on the shuttle and drivers who tend to all charge different amounts for the same trip. I read about this before my trip, and whilst I was there a gentleman at reception was complaining that his daughter was abused by taxi staff along the road because she didn't know that Ubers were not allowed. She felt quite threatened and yet the receptionist did not really give nay helpful advice. This hotel needs to address this, because it does put people off. I would stay further in town next time mainly because of this additional cost each time you want to go out and explore. The pool was great, breakfast was great each morning. It was a shame that you can still smoke in the restaurant during the lunch and dinner services, as it stinks and coming from somewhere where smoking is banned from all venues.. you really notice the impact it has. I had a great room overlooking the pool, but it did smell like sewer several times during the stay. I mentioned it to the staff who just sprayed the room with deoderant. However, on the staff, they were fabulous and were genuinely happy to hi every time you went past them. Just one minor thing.. there is piped music through the building/pool area during the day.. and after a week there... can you please use some more tunes? There were only about 4 songs that were on repeat..and it was starting to drive some of us a bit crazy.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

located at the center of seminyak.
lobby which is spacious and of course the friendly front desk .
the restaurant facing the swimming pool feels the atmosphere is very cool.
hope to stay again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
71,Great pool and vibe,40,August 2019,"We had a great stay at Ramada Encore. The pool is huge and the service is great. Will definitely recommend it. The restaurant has a great menu, so there's no real need to go anywhere else for dinner, once you've spent the day out gallivanting.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

73,Spectacular Stay!,50,December 2019,"We were very impressed with Ramada Encore Seminyak Bali!
The staff were very professional & friendly. The food & service was excellent and the location was second to none! The magnificent gardens took us right down the pool and very huge pool and clean hotel
I thoroughly recommend Ramada Encore Seminyak Bali & wish our stay was longer",Primera Hotel Seminyak
74,First time visiting Bali,40,January 2020,"I normally travel to Thailand every year but this year I decided to give Bali a go and booked the Ramada Encore in Seminyak as I was told the area was nicer with a lot of places to eat and drink. The Ramada Encore is a lovely hotel and the staff are mostly pleasant, the rooms were fantastic although placed in a pool view room on the ground floor it was sometimes hard to get a chair in front of our room and sometimes we had other guests even sit on our balcony area but that wasn't a bother really as the pool was nice.
The food at the Ramada was very basic and access to the eateries and bars was only accessed by the shuttle which left at 2 times in the day not always suitable and the other was by Taxi as the walk to the center by foot was too far and too hot in the day. I think next time I will choose a hotel closer to the center of Seminyak as I found paying for a taxi all day was expensive.
My real negative observation for this property was never having money for exchange and as the location was not tourist friendly I found this to be the most annoying part of my stay they often had no money or only could exchange $50 AUD.
Overall we did enjoy our stay but it did work out to be an expensive holiday having to use drivers and Taxis to get around so overall Bali is a cheap destination but works out more expensive when you add it all up.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
75,Awesome stay in Ramada Encore Seminyak!,50,March 2020,"I booked pool access room, the room so perfect with beautiful pool!
All staff really friendly and helpful especially the guest relation officer. Her name is Ms. Dewi. She is very kind,and helpful.
Can't wait to stay again in encore for next journey!
Thank u for make our stay enjoyable!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
76,Not a 4 star hotel,30,March 2020,"Booked this hotel largely based on Trip Advisor reviews. After staying there I wanted to add a more realistic perspective as this is not a 4 star hotel. It's really a 3 star hotel.

The Good:
-Nice staff
-Comfy bed
-Restaurant is affordable and offered several options for Indonesian food

The Bad:
-Wi-fi is terrible. It only worked well in the lobby. It was spotty in the rooms and very slow. Also I couldn't connect more than 1 device (phone and tablet) at a time.
-Facilities need a renovation. The interior was very dark and you could see where the paint was peeling and chipped
-Towels were threadbare and stained. Also they only provided 2 large towels, no wash cloths or hand towels
-Not really walkable. There were limited amenities nearby and most things were a 20 minute walk. Not the worst but when combined with the heat and humidity not something to look forward to. To be fair the hotel does provide multiple alternatives, free shuttle with a limited schedule, hotel transport, or will call a metered taxi for you (cheaper than transport). But if you like to explore by walking around your neighborhood this isn't the best option",Primera Hotel Seminyak
77,Nice stay,50,March 2020,"I was put up here for three days on my Bali vacation at Seminyak. The hotel rooms are really cozy and clean. The breakfast buffet is good. The pool in the centre of the hotel is pleasant and you can enjoy your drink or a meal beside it. The only con is it’s located a km away from the main road. When it rains the road is fully waterlogged, there was knee length depth water and the road is poorly lit. It’s advisable to use taxi here, walking in the night here did not seem so safe.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
78,If you want a relaxing holiday suggest you book elsewhere its very overpriced and loud.,10,February 2020,"They advertise coutesy bus but it only leaves every two hours and you have to book it was booked out everyday in the five day stay we had. And only 15 people could go.
Too far away to walk anywhere
Staff on front desk didnt understand english.
Woken by staff first two mornings in a row going down the stairs.
Woken by staff third night outside finishing work.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
79,Friendly staff,50,January 2020,"Ammasing experience stay with Ramada Encore Seminyak, great food so much option for breakfast and friendly staff all arround, recomended hotel to stay here for family, pool is so big. Its fun time....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
80,60th birthday,30,February 2020,"The hotel it self is a ordinary Ramada so you know what you’ll get room wise, spacious with balcony with a pool view. Pool is properly the best thing for me and the family.
However when it comes to staff 🙈... I don’t know what too say yes they are friendly but do not understand well.

Eg - we asked to reserve two tables as there was 11 of us for a birthday celebration for breakfast they said they would organise a cake and a table the morning of coming down we stood around till for 30mins as they hadn’t reserved two tables and didn’t know how to put two tables together as it wasn’t something they are allowed to do even though it was their suggestion. By the time we sat down was 10am and not much food left, the breakfast which is 100k per person which in my opinion the worst buffet... the cake offered was tiramisu ... would recommend going out.

Also we had an emergency where one of our family members had to go to the hospital and they charged us for the phone call...

When you ask for something they never say yes they always looked confused.

Check out took an hour because they had been duplicating bills on both rooms.

Unable to think out the box, also very rude about the kids.

It’s further out of the way by 10min taxi to some places so good if you don’t want to leave the hotel otherwise would recommend staying closer to the areas you want to experience. Eg shopping and beaches maybe stay closer to the beach where there is shops and food available.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
81,Cosy room and very nice pool view,50,February 2020,"The room is cosy and clean. The swimming pool is good for sun tan, book reading, or just soak in the water. 24hours room service for food, especially good for those who gets hungry in the middle of the night.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
82,Great place to stay in Bali,50,February 2020,"Ramada Encore is a great place to stay while in Bali.
The lagoon pool is awesome, you won't get how time passes while you are in that pool.
Service is excellent.

I have stayed 2 times during vacation in Bali (Before and after the Gili island trip).
First time I stayed in the pool view deluxe room, it was awesome. Huge room with all the amenities and nice pool view.
Second time I was there just for one night it was just to crash at night and enjoy the gala breakfast, so I selected the basic room. It was quite smaller without balcony.
Hence I would recommend to take the higer category room.

Restaurant is also good, drinks are little experience.
The breakfast deserves special mention, it has a huge spread.

The only disadvantage of staying in this hotel that I see is, you won't feel like going out and visit the beaches, rather you would wish to spend more time in this hotel!!!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
83,Worst customer service,20,February 2020,"Hotel has a nice infrastructure but when it come to staff and cleanness it's the worst.
Our room had bed bugs called reception to change our room as it's not properly cleaned, instead of helping front desk suggested it's my bag stuff which has an issue. eventually moved to new room.
Rooms are spacious and air-conditioning is the only highlight in hotel. Pool was clean too.
being an 4 star hotel, service is terrible and the delay of your food or drinks is not even real.
No internet connection (Wifi) in room. called multiple time for this but their either their IT department is on leave or they never come back with a solution.

No market, restaurant, café or anything is close by. apart from one laundry service and one massage place.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
84,Amazing stay!,50,February 2020,"Large pool with an exotic panoramas, the room so comfortable, the staffs are very friendly and so helpful, and they have a tasty food! Especially for breakfast there are many kind of variant , really enjoyed this second time stay at this hotel",Primera Hotel Seminyak
85,Bali holiday celebrate 60 year day.,50,February 2020,"Hello. We are a family of six and we have stayed at ramada encore by wyndham Seminyak Bali for about two weeks. They picked us up at the airport when we arrived Denpasar and drove us to our hotel. The breakfast was good, there were a lot of options and it were open for many hours. We got three big and clean rooms near eachother with a balcony and nice wiew to the pools. In the room you get towels, water, coffee, sugar, thootbrush, shaving kit and clean rooms daily. The staff is always being helpful, smile at us and service minded especially Dewi Murniasih, she has helped us a lot in our time here. This hotel got a lovely spa at the 5th floor. It dosen't cost that much and it's wonderful! We have used it several times. They also have a gym, a play room for kids and wifi. Next to the reception there is a bar and resturant with lots of good food and drinks and it's open 24 hours a day. A walk distance to the shop, taxies and shuttlebuses that can take you wherever you want. The potato head beach club are close by. We have enjoyed our time here!! We highly recommend this hotel!!❤❤❤",Primera Hotel Seminyak
86,Ramada Encore Seminyak,40,February 2020,"Room was spacious, with large Balcony overlooking the pool. The Pool was beautiful, absolutely enormous. The Restaurant food was good at a reasonable price, did find the wine prices a little expensive, especially when tax is added to the price. The Staff were very gracious & helpful, especially Dewi, The Guest Relation Officer. The downside, it is a little out of the way, not near the beach or shopping Centre. They have a Shuttle, but booking is essential, as once it’s full you cannot get Shuttle until next one scheduled, which could be a couple of hours later. To catch a taxi to Beach or shopping centre cost 50.000 Rupiah ($5 Au). Overall we had a very enjoyable stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
87,"""Your talent and the right opportunities open the first few doors, but your attitude opens the rest.""",50,February 2020,"Well, all experience was very pleasant and thanks to the hotel who gave me Deluxe room with Balcony, this is my trip on vacation and work. A little input and advice to the Food & Beverage Department, I tried to have breakfast on my first day. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant and the buffet is quite decent for its class, but my experience was really not pleasant. while I was enjoying my breakfast. The hostest of Restaurant gives me Bill (food payment) when I still eat and the food I was not yet been touched!! a little surprised and this woman spoke (BELUM SELESAI) OH UNFINISHED, Just as input for Mr. GM This kind of thing will destroy your business. I don't need to say the name, just listen and make it a very positive input ...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
88,Lovely Hotel,40,January 2020,"I really loved it here.
The location is not appealing as such, as the hotel is situated at a very far end of a discreet street. But I loved it as it far away from the normal hustle bustle of Seminyak centre.
The hotel is Open and windy. The lobby is not air-conditioned as there is ample light and wind coming in from the lovely weather outside.
The rooms are small but comfortable and cosy. But the thing is since the rooms are very closely connected to each other, then is noise from other rooms coming in as well. This is completely unavoidable here and as such, can be less comfortable to the likes of me. I personally didn't like the washroom as well, as the shower area was not fully covered and made the whole bathroom wet after the shower.
The highlight of the stay was the massive swimming pool and magnificent breakfast. The breakfast was humongous. They have such a huge variety of delectable dishes, both for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. There is a separate counter altogether for vegetarians, not only complete with breads and jams, but curries, soups etc. I would say at this price, the quantity and quality of breakfast is simply amazing.
If you don't wanna splurge, then this is the best bet because the price is extremely reasonable and every bit worth it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
89,A peace of paradise,50,January 2020,"Fantastic hotel, the swimming pool is amazing , the breakfast can't be better, you have everything that you wishe, with amazing view to the pool and the amazing garden.

92,Bad experience don't book this Hotel,20,February 2020,"Staff at the desk is friendly
Staff at the restaurant and pool are very unfriendly

The service is bad
Wait to long to order something
There English is very bad
They are very rude and unpolite

Also the room that we booked it was on the 5th floor had a broken ac I reported this at the desk and they should fixed it. Neitherless it was not fixed and we had a very bad night again!!

I would recommend to stay in another place. The hotel is situated far from the city. In that case everything should be worked properly and people should be very friendly otherwise they will lose customers",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Plenty of room",Primera Hotel Seminyak

97,Stunning Hotel,50,January 2020,"Having recently spent six nights at this delightful hotel and it being our very first time in Bali, we can only say ""when can we come back?"" The gardens, restaurant and pool area are stunning with lots of natural greenery. The grounds are very well-maintained and clean.

The staff are so friendly and cannot do enough to help you. Nothing is too much trouble.

Our room had been beautifully decorated by the staff in order to celebrate both my husband's special birthday and our wedding anniversary, which we were so touched by. We were allocated a room on the 5th floor, at the top of the building, which had a side view of the pool. Unfortunately, we had no balcony to the room, which I always love when I'm on holiday, but we didn't let it spoil our time there.

The only downside is this hotel is nowhere near the beach. They do run a free shuttle down to the beach and the main square and taxis are very cheap to get there, but as I prefer hotels nearer the beach, it would have been more than perfect had this been that bit nearer.

Having said that, Bali is a beautiful diverse place, full of its own quirkiness and madness, but full of very friendly people. I would definitely visit again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
98,Good for the price.,30,February 2020,"Overall priced well. Location wise, I stayed in the executive suite and it was annoyingly noisy with frog sounds from the bush across the road. Pest control was an issue as I had mosquitos in the room. The cleaners were great but customer service was average. Enjoyed the restaurants food. I recommend it only when it’s priced well.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

104,Very Nice,50,January 2020,"Stayed for 10 days in January.
Very nice for families.
Great pool great food and the staff are always smiling and friendly.
Special call out to the barman Eka. Really nice guy who provided fast efficient and friendly service.

Ramada is about 15 minutes from town so you'll need to book a cab to get in and out of town
(Don't pay more then 50 Rupees, $5.00au)
I paid a little extra for the pool access room, I totally recommend doing the same.

Slightly disdapointed the bar fridge in room didn't get cold (room 1319) .
Was also surprised the fridge was not stocked. Being a little distance from town it's a good idea to bring some munchies and drinks.

Beer at the bar was never cold.
I imagine beer is an important part of the Buisness so I think it's important the refrigeration is fixed as a matter of urgency. Your paying almost double for a beer at the hotel then what you would in town. So this really needs to be fixed.

Breakfast id rate 7/10.
Not to bad but room for improvement.
Very strange that bacon is not part of the buffet. You can ask for bacon, but your only given 2 very small strips.
Not a bad variety for breakfast overall.

Hotel has free WIFI that was unlimited and had good speeds.

Id love to see an app that lets you monitor your account while staying at the hotel.
It would be great to pay or top your account When ever you like without having to go to the front desk.

Overall Ramada is a great place to stay.
The staff are fantastic.
Thank you for your hospitality.

117,Amazing Value & Service,50,January 2020,"We just got home from a quick 5 night holiday at the Ramada Encore and I couldn’t fault a thing!
The service is second to none, the staff are always happy and there to help whenever needed, the rooms are clean, the pool is amazing and the food is Devine!
Yes, it’s a bit further away from the rustle and bustle, but it’s quiet and only costs around 15-20k rupiah for a taxi to Seminyak Square or the beach...
We will be back with all kids in tow!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

119,Unforgettable stay!,50,December 2019,I've such a great experience while I stayed at Ramada Encore Seminyak Bali. They have an amazing pool with tropical garden around. The room was very clean and the food was tasty. Thank you for all the friendly and helpfull staff. Recommend it!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
120,Beautiful pool,50,January 2020,"We stayed at Ramada for 11 nights and the hotel was fantastic, staff were very friendly and helpful, our boy got very sick from a restaurant outside the hotel and the staff organised a doctor to the room which was there with in 15 minutes and the next day they rang the room to see how he was and sent up some fruit to our room for him to start eating, they really did care.
The rooms were great, we had a beautiful view of the pool, shower was great and the beds were comfortable and clean.
The pool was the best if you have kids that love the water look no further, the pool is HUGE and plenty of seating around the pool, not over chlorinated just right👍
The location is also good because you are able to go for walks with out any people trying to sell you something because you are in the local suburb which is great to explore.
The restaurant has a great breakfast and for lunch and dinner there is plenty of choice on the menu.
Well done Ramada we will be back!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
121,Good hotel very friendly staff,50,December 2019,"The hotel was amazing , very good pool and very nice view ! The breakfast so briliance, everyday you will have many kind of food and the taste very fantasic , every morning you can get very good coffee from barista Putu Wijaya and dilan ,
I am a connoisseur of cocktails and every day I never miss a cocktail from a bartender who is very friendly and professional, thank you bar team Reja, Novilia, Eka, Bobby, Iwan, and Komang always make cocktails with satisfying flavors, this is a very extraordinary experience, I make sure my next vacation will stay here again",Primera Hotel Seminyak
122,3 month stay,50,January 2020,"The place was so amazing that I stayed there from October 15 2019 til January 15 2020.
The front desk staff from their manager Kadek to the staff Guns, Fenny, Putri, Agus, Mahar, Budy and a few others I can't recall we're simply a family for me while I was there.
There are tiny issues I had but once reported to the front desk it was fixed/repaired/replaced immediately.
The kitchen staff from the manager to the chef were all great. The food there was better than other 5* rated hotels I've been at.
The bartenders on the other hand.. they were amazing.. all the bar staff have been helpful just like the rest of the staff including housekeeping and Mr Jaya for their daily efforts to ensure the guests are happy with their accomodations.

Terimakasi Ramada Encore!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
123,One of the worst hotels I've stayed in,10,January 2020,"I suspect that this place could get no worse, the staff are surly and disengaged, the management are entirely unseen and the service is embarrassingly poor, we had so many issues and it was like talking to a brick wall. The bar staff are rude and unfriendly as are the Front office team, my mother was querying her bill (as we had to do every day)

and one receptionist simply walked away mid conversation. The bar team are so rude they are bordering hostile, lying and deceit seem to be the team's strongest skill, and as mentioned, not a manager to be seen in a week.
The pool is nice, the service appalling and the location dreadful - just don't book here would be my advice",Primera Hotel Seminyak
124,"Worth the price, definitely repeat booking in this hotel!",50,January 2020,"What I love the most is it has spacious room. When you travel with more luggage, but it's still wide thou. My only cons is the distance between the lift and the room which place quite far. But when I asked reception to move to the closer room because my feet was sick, everything's set up! I'm a happy customer.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
125,Disappointing,20,December 2019,"The distance from everything should be factored. Do not rely on the elusive shuttle bus or hotel car service, organise your own transport BEFORE getting to Bali.
Highly recommend staying in a pool room if you must stay here. The Superior rooms do not have a ""garden"" view.
Do not order the food you want, it won't be available.
Do not order cocktails that are not on the menu either. Even after a detailed explanation on how to make the drink, you will receive something else and will be expected to pay for it even if you send it back and don't drink it.
Needless to say, our first experience in Bali was not optimal.
The Spa deserves a mention - the best service you could possible ask for. So much so, we went everyday (also because we couldn't get anywhere else anyway!).
Possibly our fault for travelling to a third world country over the New Year period when all of Java were there also (according to every single driver who wouldn't take us anywhere).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
126,Awesome hotel,50,January 2020,Excellent value for money.Buffet breakfast was very tasty.Spa facility is also available in the hotel.They have very reasonable price and friendly staff.We enjoyed alot.thanks for making our trip memorable.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

128,"Book Ramada Encore hotel in Seminyak, you will love it",50,January 2020,"We stayed at Ramada Encore for a week to celebrate the new years. We really loved and enjoyed our stay.

136,Hotel needs proper pest control.,30,December 2019,"6 of us were 1st time staying at Ramada Encore by Wyndham Seminyak Bali for 1 week in December 2019 for the New Year holiday break.
The food is great. The staffs are helpful, but the order service is slow and not well organized. Room cleaning service and linen change are provided daily, but the rooms in the hotel and the surrounding area definitely need proper pest control. From 6 of us, 3 of us got bitten by the bed bug. All three of us had separate single beds we slept in.
After 2 weeks of using the cream treatment, I still have discolored skin and scars on my hands.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

146,I enjoyed three days holiday.,50,December 2019,"I stayed with my family for three days at Hotel Ramada Wyndham Seminyak, Bali in December this year.The hotel is very nice. The day I checked in, the same day my room air conditioner went off, which I called and complained about on the reception. But even after my delay, when my problem was not resolved, I myself went to the reception from where I was sent to Manager Dewi. He solved my problem immediately And my room was changed. Dewi is also a good manager with a good woman. Which does not avoid the problem. Rather it resolves immediately. He is a good person.

147,"A pleasant, comfortable stay away from home.",40,December 2019,"First time at Bali & happy with the hotel. Very friendly and courteous staff. They attended to our requests (e.g. extra body shampoo swiftly). Our room didn't come with breakfast but it was available every morning for just 100,000 rupiah per pax. Not spectacular spread but adequate for a good meal so you can go explore the Seminyak area without having to fuel up again ;-) The hotel may not be right in the middle of Seminyak town itself but it is very near. You can walk to Seminyak if you don't mind the heat or take My Blue Bird taxi (less than 5 mins ride). There is free shuttle to various spots in Seminyak. Just book before you want to go. Spa at the hotel was amazing. Overall a very pleasant stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
148,Third stay,40,December 2019,"Third stay at the hotel.. Arrive there in the middle of december. Peak season has not started yet. But the hotel is still packed. I can see why as the service is just 5 stars and the hotel is well maintained. The food is also very good. Nothing much to complain except for the do not allow grabcar or gocar to pick us from the hotel.. Almost a five stars. All the hotel around the world has allowed service such as grab and uber to be used but it is still restricted in a lot of hotel in bali.
The restaurant is not very expensive and the food ad always quite good and has lots of variety. Enjoyable stay.
Use bluebird for transport as it is metered so it is better, unless if you want to rent a car, the hotel can get you a vendor to do it with quite reasonable price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
149,"Nice rooms, horrible customer service",30,November 2019,"The rooms on this resort were very comfortable, with a great pool view! Very clean. The customer service while eating dinner at the buffet was horrible! The staff didn’t not come a check up on us at all. It took them about 10 minutes to clear our plates off the table.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
150,It is our pleasant Trip,40,December 2019,"The room was well very kept and spacious. The variety of food for breakfast is ample to suit different kind of travellers All hotel staff of different section are courteous and helpful. I particularly give my good comment to Ms Dewi Murmilasih who helped me to find a travel agent to take us to various beauty spots in Bali. She also gave her personal attention to arrange transportation for us to be at Bali Airport to board the flight on time, I also thanked another staff, Meyka, who helped me to do online check in and print the Boarding Pass.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The stay was pleasant, friendly and courteous staffs. I wish to specifically complement one of your front counter staff named Vita. She attended to our queries professionally and in a friendly manner and with smile. She was pleasant in her approach. She gave us good advices on the places we could consider visiting. She made our stay at Ramada Hotel a pleasant stay. There is another staff named Dewi was also very helpful at the time when I was waiting for a taxi.

155,I cannot recommend this hotel,10,December 2019,"The bali taxi mafia appear to ""own the street"" approaching and ending at this Ramada Encore hotel. I raised this concern to the hotel manager, who amazingly does not see it as a problem. The hotel taxi stand even has a sign that supports this taxi mafia saying that no Grab or GoCar are allowed to pickup at his hotel. Amazing! I had a Grab taxi who managed to come to the hotel, but the driver was afraid he would be attacked by the local taxi mafia and asked me to cancel the reservation! I asked the hotel manager to please sort out this problem. He did not sort out this problem and seems perfectly Okay with this local taxi monopoly overcharging all of his guests. I needed to head to the airport, so the hotel dropped me at the closest Circle K, but the taxi mafia were watching and were waiting to attack all the drivers at this new location 400+ meters from the hotel. My driver came and immediatily turned around and left! So, I had to walk with my 2 suitcases for several hundred more meters around 2PM (hottest time of the day) to the main road. Even in this case, the taxi mafia were watching me and chasing off all Grab and GoCar that I ordered and all were cancelling the bookings due to being afraid of taxi mafia. To make matters worse, my buddy had a similar issue with his Grab taxi and needed to walk to the Circle K (~ 400 meters) in the scorching sun to the main road. The hotel is fine once you are inside, but this is not an all in one resort like you find in Nusa Dua. It is instead a hotel to sleep in and go out to enjoy Seminyak, etc. But, it is not that close to local attractions / amenities, so you will need to take a taxi in / out often. Due to these concerns, I canNOT recommend this hotel until the hotel takes this serioulsy and starts to challenge this illegal activity.

You can find my confirmed review on Agoda. Agoda on the other hand I can recommend as probably the best option for booking hotels in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
156,Amazing place - Pleasant stay. Value for money,50,December 2019,"It’s a beautiful property with a lot of breakfast options, big pool, kids pool. Scenic views inside the property with absolutely amazing staff who always greets you with a smile, namaste. Especially Dewi who was always there for all our queries and made our stay seamless and memorable at this Ramada property.
A good choice for Indians because it has an Indian corner in breakfast with vegetarian options.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
157,Pathetic Behaviour towards Tourists,10,December 2019,I loved my stay only at the Ramada Encore... hotel was absolutely heaven but when i was leaving for Ubud.. I booked gojek because hotel drop service rates was more than double than what Gojek provide... So while leaving hotel all drivers came and blocked our taxi like they were going to damage taxi and started speaking rubbish to our taxi driver and abused me and my wife also... is this the way tourists should be treated in such a big hotel ??? Safety should be a main priority but when all this things were happening i dint feel safe at all... So i would love to give ZERO star...,Primera Hotel Seminyak

162,Excellent family/ budget hotel,30,October 2019,"Firstly, the service and room were impeccable. Every staff member said hello, were extremely friendly and helpful. We loved our three bedroom room, it was incredibly spacious and great for our family trip. In saying this, the amenities were very basic- in particular the lack of face washers. There are NO facewashers available in this hotel and when we asked for some on our first night, we were met with confused looks and a housekeeper had delivered an array of towels to our room. We used hand towels throughout the stay in lieu of facewashers. There was a large breakfast spread but not a lot for westerners. The food portions also need a review. We often dined at the hotel, however, we noticed that the kids fried rice was almost twice the size of a regular fried rice, for a portion of the price. It was also often not overly busy, however our food one night took an hour to arrive. We did like the chicken curry flavour and thought that was the best thing on their menu. Drinks are expensive for the hotel type and it is a fair way from the shopping/ eating streets. Overall, this hotel is good for budget, the rooms are good value and the service is good but some other things need a review.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

I have to say I didn't meet one member of staff who didn't wear a smile and they were all incredibly friendly and helpful.Specially Meyka

The only small downfalls I think would be housekeeping was a little slow at times and the buffet breakfast was a little too much quantity over quality.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

171,Good hotel but not in Seminyak centre,30,November 2019,"Stayed for 5 nights in November as part of a cruise package.

Good sized rooms with efficient air con, big beds and wet room style showers.Rooms also have safes and tea and coffee trays, as well as fridges and balconies (although we could not access ours)

The showers however were a bit of a problem as they leaked water all ove rthe bathroom floor every time we used them.

The staff and service were fine but sometimes the English skills were a little lacking.
They did not supply extra toilet roll or tea bags when requested despite agreeing they would.
There was a hiccup when we exceeded the deposit on our credit card and they refused to supply any further srvices to our room until we paid our bill.

The food in the hotel was Ok but there was no free breakfast as indicated on TA and the buffet breakfast was relatively expensive with an upgrade required to get a decent cup of coffee. The evening meals were good quality and cocktails were well made if again a little pricey. I paticularly liked their raspberry mojitos.

The only drawback for us was the hotel location which is quite some way out of Seminyak. They do run a shuttle service but it's not very frequent and they ask you to sign up the day before which is not always convenient. There are a few restaurant and bars within walking distance but the road is very dark at night and feels unsafe at night.

I had an excellent massage at the spa, which really helped my sore thighs after a day's white water rafting. the price for this was very reasonable and i was able to get a booking within the hour.

if we came to Bali again we would opt for a hotel in Seminyak itself",Primera Hotel Seminyak
172,Best Wishes to Ms. Vita & Dewi,50,December 2019,"Dear Sir/Mam,

We have stayed at your hotel this month. We liked your hotel services, specially your staff who make us smile. I would like to Thank to Ms. Vita and Ms. Dewi. They both are very generous and helpful. They made my wife's Birthday and arranged a Birthday cake at dot 12 in our room.

I would suggest if management of the Hotel recommend them for their promotion to higher level as they both actually know how to respect Guest's.

Thanks to Hotel and to complete staff.

173,"Incredible service, devine meals",50,July 2019,"I reviewed Ramada Encore By Wyndham Seminyak after our stay in July, in the rush of writing the review, I forgot to mention some of the exceptional customer service from the restaurant staff, they were friendly, caring and created memorable experiences. Arta was one of the amazing dinner and breakfast staff who would make sure that we had a table ready every time we came to Mahadewi restaurant, the personalised service was exceptional, he went above and beyond every time, checking how we were progressing without meals and if we needed anything, we felt really special and spoilt. We are very grateful to them all, (sorry I cant remember all your names), but you made our stay a wonderful experience. Keep it up.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
174,Awesome retreat beyond the words...Falling in love with Encore,50,September 2019,"At reception, greeted by fresh breeze and Putri with a open heart and beautiful smile bought shiver in my spine. Just fall in love with the place, simplicity with modern amenities, what else one look for. Swimming pool, having a pool bar. Room was awesome, simple having a balcony over the pool. watching the kites in the sky made my jopurney memorable. One point shop to get your money cahnged or getting a scooty for the day. Encore could arrang any thing. Had baliness massage in the hotel top floor was very cool and affordable. Super awesome experience of life. I like to visit again and again",Primera Hotel Seminyak
175,Loved my stay!!,40,December 2019,"My partner and I had an amazing stay at the Ramada for our vacation. The entire staff were very friendly from the moment we arrived. Dewi and Lam Tyow, Reski Indra, Diah Purnama and many other's whose name I wish I wrote down, were so helpful and us feel so welcomed during our time at the hotel. Dewi was even so nice to check on me after my departure to ensure that we arrived home back to the USA safely! We will miss the amazing people and wonderful buffet breakfast each morning. One of our favorite highlights that we encourage everyone to try out is the massage offered through the spa! It was an excellent deal and there's a happy hour price (40% off) if you book between 8-2pm. Luh Darma was my massage therapist and was wonderful! Overall this hotel was a great value for our stay and I recommened you consider it when staying in Seminyak.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
176,Meyka so helpfull,50,December 2019,We had a great stay here at Ramada . The staff were very friendly and helpful and could not have been more happy to serve us. The breakfast was amazing and so delicious. Pool was great to swim in. Rooms were great and the beds very comfortable with water everyday to drink.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
177,Pretty average to say the least,30,December 2019,"Having spent a few weeks in multiple hotels around Bali, this hotel was disappointing, especially as it was the last one of the holiday. The hotel itself has a lovely pool and restaurant however the pool beds are all quite uncomfortable as the do not have covers on them.

After our first night we came to the conclusion that the beds had bed bugs as we woke up with lots of bites; we managed to change rooms but it took a lot of explained as there was a bit of a language barrier and all we really got was a 'sorry'. The beds however, are some of the most comfortable beds in Bali and the pillows are fabulous.

I know it was my fault as this should've been looked into before booking, however the location was a let down for us, one of the things we loved about previous hotels in Bali is that we were able to walk out the hotel and go to a range of different restaurants and activities, this hotel is a bit out of the way and there is not much to do around it; so keep that in mind as I know some guests are here just to relax in the hotel. We would have preferred a location closer to Seminyak Square as this is nowhere near.

My last complaint is that there is no shower for guests to used once checked out. The hotel were nice enough to give me an extra hour before I had to check out but I still had 5 and a half hours before I was due to leave for the airport. There are no indoor air-conditioned areas other than the private rooms which means that anyone who is not leaving the hotel until late will most likely get sweaty as it is hot here and won't have the opportunity to shower before they leave which I think is a real downfall of the hotel; that last impression is what their customers take home with them.

Last but not least, housekeeping were quite slow and took 30-40 minutes just to bring a toilet roll, luckily no one was needing it straight away.

On a more positive note, then buffet breakfast is immense and all the food is amazing.

I would not recommend the hotel to others, I have found nicer and cheaper in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
178,Great value family stay!,40,December 2019,"A wonderful 9 night resort stay with family ( a party of 9) for an excellent price. We booked directly through hotel and got a good deal. We included a airport pickup by hotel. The pickup was flawless driver was ready and waiting and it was only a 25 min ride late at night. Check in was great we were greeted by one of the front guest relations staff Vita, who made us feel really welcome.

Rooms - resort hotel - about 300 rooms. Great for couples and family groups. We had a combination of executive pool view rooms and deluxe pool rooms. The difference being the executive rooms were on the 4 floor, and had an enclosed glass balcony so aircon could flow out, and they contained a small kitchenette with a larger fridge which we found great for cooling water, drinks and lunch time snacks. Other than that rooms exactly same view, decor, size and bathrooms - showers only. The room was quiet enough except for when party goers came home late at night a couple of times- but that could happen anywhere. Air con was cool when it wasn't shutting down as it often did at least 3 times a day or night. This was fixed by flicking switch on switch board located beside door. But was annoying if it happened in the night. Rooms away from restaurant bar are probably the quietest. Good wifi in all areas of resort. Small Gym with the essentials.

Pool - Fantastic.. The hotel has an excellent large pool area where we easily got lounges. Both shade and sun choices available. Great pool bar service. Good long after noon Happy hour with a good selection of 2 for 1 cocktails. fro

Food - the breakfast buffet was fantastic with a large selection of foods. Well worth having. Food was of a very good quality- and was a reasonable price around 60- 100K IDR. We had a number of meals and all were tasty and well presented.

Staff- The staff were friendly and helpful. Vita, particularly was always ready with a friendly smile and she went to a lot of trouble to make sure we were having a good stay. Vita even had a special cake and room decorations organised for our family member who was having a special birthday on our stay. .

Spa- was relaxing, clean and air conditioned. Good value during the times of 8am and 2pm where you received 40% discount. Bringing a 1hr massage down to about 220K IDR. Dharma gave a very good back, neck and shoulder massage.

Location -The hotel is a little isolated on the outskirts of Seminyak. It didn't bother our large group much as the resort pool, prices and facilities suited our family group get together. Taxis were cheap and we had a few day trips organised. Goosey, one of the resort drivers was very accommodating and friendly. But if you are after a beach holiday it is probably not for you. There were a couple of good restaurants close by. Balkan BBQ, Rev Bistro, Laggas and a little Italian with 15-20 min walk that was quite safe and well lit. There was a couple of little mini marts within A 5 min walk for extra water and snacks. Bintang supermarket was a short 10 min taxi ride and worth it if you wanted to do a bigger shop. There was also a great little spa and a laundry within a 5 min walk if required.

Overall a great stay for our family group. Once again a special thank you to Vita and Goosey for making a pour stay a memorable one!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
179,Ramada Encore Bali - Hotel service,50,December 2019,The staffs were friendly and helpful. (Especially Miss Vita).Cleanliness and facilities wise i would recommend this hotel to anyone.Location also is good.The food was great and i was glad that Indian food was available there.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
180,Great Service,40,December 2019,"Visited Ramada Encore for a day check-in as a pit stop before our flight out of Bali since our Villa was unavailable for late-check out. Well-priced hotel with a great pool, and a distance away from the main hustle and bustle of Bali.

We were at the hotel by 1pm, as the kids were in need of their nap time. Initially, we were told that check in timings are at 3pm and there was nothing that could be done. After explaining the situation (with a baby in tow, and a sleepy toddler in the other), Agung Martin (front desk) managed to help speak with housekeeping to get us a room which we could rest in for a couple of hours. Appreciated the flexibility and understanding. Thanks Martin!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
181,"Amazing hotel,Great Value for money",50,June 2019,"I stayed at Ramada encore twice while in Bali in June,The rooms are clean and very comfortable with amazing pillows.On my second visit I was upgraded to a pool side room as I work in travel and presented my business card.The level of service upon check in was so simple and smooth.The food was great and if you ate local cuisine it as extremely cheap.The only down side is when you go over your deposit on your room you are not notified to pay the bill just keeps going up(also ye cant really give out about this if ye keep ordering drink after drink :) The sun also leaves the pool around 4.15 so you need to be an early riser if you want a full day of Sunbathing thats not a complaint its just a heads up for fellow sunloves. Over all great stay and will be back next July.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Have stayed a total of about 45 nights over a 3 month period, amazing rooms, great a/c, amazing staff (Arta is the most friendly, attentive, excellent staff member you could hope for, never anything too big or small of a question for either he or any of the Ramada staff, just excellent - Thanks Arta). The restaurant is conveniently positioned, pool is amazing (and huge), hotel is in a quiet spot yet close to get to the shopping strip or about 5 mins by scooter to the beach. Great hotel, highly recommend!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
184,Our Server Arta was Great!,30,December 2019,"We arrived early to the Ramada so we had some time to grab something to eat and decided to have lunch at the bar/restaurant. Our server Arta Laksana was excellent and really made us feel so comfortable and welcomed during our wait.

188,THE WORST IN BALI OR MAYBE IN THE WORLD,10,November 2019,"This is definitely the worst hotel ever !!!!

NOTE: this is the first time to write such a review about hotel

I stayed for 6 nights so far and that's my honest openion

1- I had no internet connection (Wifi) in my room and complained about it many times with no solution
2- In-room dining is the worst experience you will have. I just ordered pasta marinara and a dessert, it came not cooked well, the sause is very watery and with no taste at all and it barely had seefood taste in it because there was only 2 tiny prawns in the whole pasta, so i didn't finish it and i didn't even try the dessert i just asked for my money back.
3- They treat you like a thief, whenever i order anything in the restaurant, bar, and the pool. They give me the bill right away without even asking for it even if I say keep it open i will still order something else, always the response: sorry you have to pay NOW !!
4- The service is terrible and the delay is not even real !!!!
5- Staff attitude is not the best
6- Too many insects
7- THE MOST SUPRISING THING HAPPENED, i just called today for extra bed cover as the AC is freezing all the time, i waited for 1 hour maybe more (I called 3 times and someone else answers so i ask for the same thing from the begining over and over) then they finally sent a cover with an open Duvet (not fixed properly) which was weird and inside i found a BLOOD STAIN, so i took it and went down to the reception and the one in charge kept me waiting for 15 more mins ""just to change it"" !!

NOTE: there was a note at my check-in that this is my HONEYMOON !!!

I work in property management field, and for me this only means, there is no supervision on housekeeping, kitchen, pest control, and the front desk staff, so simply 4 stars is too much on this hotel.

I am so frustrated and really disgusted, if i ever come back to Bali i will never stay at this hotel for sure, and you should do the same.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
189,Meyka so nice,50,November 2019,"The breakfast is great and the view is amazing for the price! Definitely worth every penny you could spend here. Will be back again, staff was wonderful and always help . Will back for my next holiday",Primera Hotel Seminyak
190,Would definitely stay here again!,40,November 2019,"Pros
-Day spa is exceptional and the staff up there are incredible
-Bed is super comfortable
-Amazing staff and service
-Beautiful pool area
-Buffet breakfast is great
-Rooms are nice and clean
-On arrival we received a free upgrade to a poolside room
-In house restaurant food is really nice

Cons
-The free shuttle bus... where to begin....
For starters it’s almost always fully booked, but we managed to book in to be dropped off at Seminyak square at 2pm and picked up and returned to the hotel at 4.30pm.
The hotel failed to mention that after we got picked up from Seminyak the driver would be driving to Kuta in peak hour traffic to collect more people.
We were in the car for well over 2 hours, and if this was communicated with us we would’ve got a taxi, this was such poor communication, it’s not really good enough either considering the hotel don’t allow ubers/gojeks come here so really your only options are a taxi (always ask them to put the meter on) or the shuttle bus service which was not so good at all, this is probably the only real negative and to be honest it’s not that big a deal when you can just get a taxi
-A little further out from Seminyak square than other places we looked at
-The restaurant does charge a few additional taxes we weren’t aware of
-The room above us had people stomping around which made it a little noisy at night

Overall
This is the second time we have stayed here, I love this hotel, purely for the staff, the pool area, the comfy bed and the amazong day spa and the girls that make it what it is, and you can’t go wrong with the buffet breakfast here.
I would definitely stay here again but next time I wouldn’t even bother using their shuttle bus service, I’d rather just pay for a taxi which is still so cheap here anyway.
I can’t wait to come back next time!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
191,"NOT ACCEPTABLE, POOR Management",10,November 2019,"Ramada Encore Seminyak
I travel with medication syringes which must be kept cold, NOT frozen of course. Upon arrival our room fridge only is at 18c as apparently all their fridges so nothing stays cold, not even your water. I had hotel come o room ,check fridge but that is as cool as it gets. I explained my medication must be stored between 2c to 8c, .they offered to keep in their fridge. Ok, I explained at least 8 times,maybe more it MUST only be in fridge,NOT freezer, they said they understand, I was very insistent on this fact.
2 days later I get medication and it has been frozen solid. My medication is now USELESS . After 6 days of discussions with them and much frustration they will only pay for HALF cost of replacing medication at the hospital . This cost me $1500.00 in Australia so as you can imagine my anger at being asked to pay 1/2 for something they damaged. They did nicely explain they have a fridge to keep special cakes in though 🤬🤬🤬
Very disappointed in front of house staff and management not taking responsibility for a huge mistake.
Won’t be recommending this hotel to anyone after a very bad and disappointing experience 🤬🤬🤬
All other staff at hotel have been lovely though. Pool area nice but not enough sun lounges, only 8 with cushions others hard & broken plastic. Timber decking is dangerous and broken although they are doing some minor repairs. Rooms near lifts are really noisy as is most of the rooms as it echoes from everywhere and rooms seem to have paper thin walls.
& as mentioned grudges are totally inadequate and don’t even chill bottled water.
So much better accommodation is available in Seminyak, definitely look past this hotel and choose elsewhere",Primera Hotel Seminyak
192,Beautiful,50,November 2019,"This is actually our first trip to Bali (we stayed 6 nights here) and we came purely for the relaxation factor. From the minute we walked in, the service was lovely and the staff so helpful and friendly. The pool is so clean and warm, the rooms are comfortable and nice to relax in (where do they get those pillows???) and the menu suits both vegetarian and fussy eaters (me). Whilst the hotel is a way from the beach and main shops, there is a shuttle which is convenient and punctual. WiFi is actually good and easy to access. There is plenty of poolside seating (both sun and shade) and cocktails a plenty. Everything is very clean (even the toilets at the pool) and our rooms seemed to be made up at our convenience. It’s definitely worth getting a pool view. We would definitely come back again - could not fault anything. Thank you very much Ramada Encore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
193,Highly recommend!,50,November 2019,"We stayed at Ramada Encore for 5 nights and had a great time. The room was great, pool was beautiful and the bar/restaurant had a great menu and was very reasonably priced (good happy hour deal for cocktails too!). Breakfast was included in our room booking and the buffet was amazing with a great range of food. Staff were very polite and friendly! The hotel is a little bit out of the city centre, but this wasn’t an issue for us at all - you can easily get a cheap taxi into town or it’s about a 40 minute walk to the beach. We also used the hotel gym (basic but functional) and got massages at the spa (a little more expensive than the places on the street in town, but still very reasonably priced and the service was great). All in all we had a great and very relaxing trip - zero complaints here! Would definitely recommend this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
194,EXCELLENT SERVICE,50,November 2019,"The Ramada Encore staff was excellent. We stayed 3 nights and everything was great. The service, food and rooms made my first trip to Bali memorable and comfortable!

196,Our favourite hotel during our 10day visit,50,November 2019,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our 4night stay at Ramada Encore. The staff are very friendly and welcoming.
The facilities are very clean and easily accessible. The pool is well set up with lots of lounging areas to relax. The air conditioned gym has the basics but is more than enough.
The in house restaurant is also fantastic with dining tables that are setup right next to the pool! Food is delicious, well presented and great value for money. They gave us discounts on our food as well which was really nice.
We also thoroughly enjoyed our massages from the Spa on the 5th floor of the hotel. The Con that I can think of is the shower head in our room. It was free to move and swivel on its wall attachment when in use. Which then made the water go everywhere in the bath room.
Apart from that it’s been a great holiday. Everything was in the hotel compound.
Transport/taxis are easily organised with the staff at the main desk.
Thank you to the lovely staff that looked after us during our stay, thank you Tio, Eka, Yurike and the rest of the staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
197,"Expected better, noise levels are like a hostel",30,November 2019,"The breakfast, pool and rooms are lovely. The only factor that let me down was the constant loudness in the hallways, slamming doors from neighbouring rooms and from the pool at night. Management need to enforce a rule of after 10pm it should be quiet, no room parties or pool parties after hours. The sounds echoe around the complex making it impossible to get to sleep. 4 nights in a row I have had to complain about the continuous noise. If you're into partying and drinking stay here. If you want a relaxing and peaceful time, spend a bit more and go to a better hotel.
I was offered to move rooms, however this would have caused me an inconvenience, it's easier to enforce the rules they kindly provide us with in the rooms, at reception and by the pool. Pool shuts at 9pm. But they allow guests to use it after hours, making it an inconvenience for other guests.
Looking forward to leaving soon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

200,Excellent Value But Racist Behaviour,40,November 2019,Had a very comfortable stay but again this property is a family friend but even couple friendly rooms are clean and spacious you get the best value for the money spent we spent approximately US$40 per night per room and found it to be excellent.only negative as across Southeast Asia in most of these receptionists(Ex:-Ms.Anggrawati) are extremely biased and very partial to words and westerners & very conveniently & deliberately avoid Asian tourists by clearly making them feel otherwise which is simply pathetic as it’s the asians who splurge in todays times which they fail to understand.People like Ms.Anggrwati give a bad name to the hotel for no reason...Shame on such behaviour and to spoil a perfect stay.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
201,Another wonderful stay at Ramada Encore.,50,November 2019,"Back for another stay at our second home in Bali. Ramada Encore Seminyak never lets us down. The staff are wonderful and so accommodating. We look forward to our trip back each time.
The restaurant has a great selection of dishes to suit all tastes and are very reasonably priced. Happy hour cocktails 2 for 1 - the Strawberry Daquiris don’t come fast enough for us. They are delicious.
Huge lagoon style pool means everyone has plenty of space to move. The ladies working in the spa are magic. Massage, facial or pedi they do it all.
This trip there were 13 of us for my 50th birthday and the 3 bedroom family rooms were a great size to accommodate us all. Pool access rooms are perfect. Lovely quiet and relaxed atmosphere at Ramada Encore.

Do not be fooled because it is low priced, it is a great property. I’ve stayed all over Bali - and this is the best I’ve seen in this private range ($35-40 US). A fantastic deal !

The grounds are well manicured, the staff is highly professional and respectful. The pool is absolutely huge, and since it is summer here in November it is nice and warm! It is worth the extra couple dollars to get a balcony with pool view.

217,Staff makes you feel at home,50,October 2019,"We have stayed at this hotel many times over the last 5 years. We find this place affordable, clean, safe and the staff are very helpful.
The location of this hotel is away for the night club area, away from the main street but not far from Seminyak main shopping area (15 minute walk).
There are many facilities close by: laundry, massage, mini market and local food as well as restaurants of all different nationalities.
Breakfast is buffet style with a good choice of food which is different each day.
Car parking is excellent and has good security and if you need a taxis they are very quick to respond.
The pool is clean and large enough not to be crowded.
The guest relation manager was very good and arranged a special surprise for my sister and brother-in-law birthday. They were both moved by the effort that the staff had put in to make their day special.
We always give this place recommendation if we know anybody going to Bali and we will stay here again when we visit Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

220,Nice hotel,50,October 2019,This hotel is very recommended! You can get lots of food for breakfast here and it almost never runs out! The room's design is very good and it is also very wide.

227,Ramada Encore Seminyak -Fantastic all round,40,October 2019,"My partner and I recently spent 8 nights at the Ramada in Seminyak, Bali to celebrate our 3rd anniversary. Initially, I wanted a room that was poolside so I didn’t have to walk through other facilities and people to reach the pool. This definitely hit the spot. Our room, described as a “pool access” room was exactly that. We had a small verandah/porch with two person couch, coffee table and clothes drying rack that then stepped down directly into the pool, onto a shallow ledge, that had a couple of sun lounges in the water, and then into the 1.2m blue tiled mosaic pool. It was 1.2m standard depth across the pool. The pool guys maintained the water at a beautiful 28 degrees and it was impeccably clean. My only complaint would be with regard to the sun lounges. They are right at your doorstep and as such, you’d assume that they were for your exclusive use, but they are not. We woke on several mornings to find that families staying on the third floor had come down to make camp on our doorstep, or just other couples for that matter. Eventually, everyone moves, but it was not as private as I had anticipated.

Our room was as one would expect with the standard amenities. The shower was a lovely large space, although it took a full two minutes before any warm water made its way through the pipes. Every time. Lots of personal products were provided, the hairdryer did it’s job and the toilet worked!
Towels were very clean, as was the bed linen. The mattress was very comfortable and the massive, feather down pillows were to die for! Everyday, our room was beautifully cleaned and two complimentary bottles of water provided.

The restaurant service was fabulous. The buffet breakfast included salads, fruits, hot dishes, Indian specialties, a chef to cook pancakes and waffles on request, three chefs to cook eggs, bacon, omelettes and more on request, juices, coffee, teas, pastries, freshly baked breads and the most amazing range of cakes and sweet treats. The lunch and dinner menus are the same. The menu is varied with two nights a week
where bbq buffets are offered in the evening. The prices are very reasonable.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and always willing to assist. Of special mention, Micky (photographed on our last night with us) was an outstanding employee in the restaurant, with prompt service, and the ability to speak very good English, which is not always the case. He made great recommendations and made our stay all the more welcoming. The bar staff know how to make the best cocktails and the two for one happy hour between 3 and 7 everyday means you can indulge for around $3 Australian. Bargain!

Ramada is a little further out from the center of Seminyak than we originally thought, and as such, we relied on taxi services daily. The security at the gate definitely gave us a feeling of safety. The gym was well equipped, the pool table was an added bonus and the spa was great. The spa treatments are a little pricey but if you get in during 8-2, they do 40% discount. That being said, there are no $8 massages here! The front desk will change some money for you, but there is no dedicated money changer on site. When we asked, they could only change $50 Australian. There is a guest desk to answer questions, but no dedicated tour desk to book attractions etc and only a limited number of brochures. That’s ok if you know your way around Bali, but if you’re a first time visitor, you may need more assistance.

This is definitely a hotel that attracts guests that want quality amenities at a fair price. Guests were generally respectful of others and as such, the pool area is relaxing and quiet. I would suggest that Ramada needs to change up their playlists; every breakfast-same music, every dinner-same music, swimming in the pool-same music. For eight days, there are some songs I may never want to hear again!

Overall, we were very happy with our stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
228,Amazing hotel,50,October 2019,"We stay in this hotel 3 night , and we tray the cocktail blue margarita is very good , and the hotel also have the Coffe Corner for get any kind of coffe in Barista..

235,Amazing experience! 10/10,50,October 2019,"I have just returned to Australia following an amazing 16 day holiday in Bali. I stayed for the duration of my holiday at the Ramada Encore Hotel in Seminyak and thought i’d Pass on my experience.

Apon arrival, I was told that I would be upgraded to a pool view room with a balcony on the second floor free of charge which was fantastic. The room itself was fantastic. Decent sized balcony overlooking the pool, large and extremely comfortable bed, TV and all was clean and modern. Bathroom was spotless and modern. Cleaners attended daily and all toiletries/towels/bottles of water were replenished. The Ramada staff were very welcoming and friendly. They remembered our names and made us feel right at home. The pool was lovely! Spent lots of time relaxing on the day beds in the pool which was fantastic. Buffet breakfast was great and price was reasonable. Really big room service menu with many types of cousines.

Location was perfect for us! Only a couple of mins scooter ride to Seminyak square and really easy to get to Kuta Beach and Canggu. Had a fantastic time and will 100% be staying here when I return next year. Would recommend to anyone traveling to Bali, whether singles, couples or families as I believe this place caters to all.

I would like to give a special mention to a lovely young lady that worked there named Tio! She was soo nice and definitely made our stay more enjoyable. She would always ask us how our day had been and gave us great suggestions of what to eat, drink and do in Bali. Cannot thank her enough for her hospitality!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

258,What an awesome find! Loved our stay here at the Ramada Encore! We will be back!,50,September 2019,"So very happy to have found this hotel! We were treated as one of the family by Tita, our Guest Relations Manager (absolutely brilliant!) together with Yumi and Feny on the front desk. Our ""Deluxe Room"" had a king-size bed, a sofa to lounge around on, two bottles of filtered water each day, slippers for our tired feet, everything to make our stay, memorable! Location was a little way out from Seminyak's ""Eat Street"" however, saying that, my husband ""walked back from Seminyak"" to the hotel the day of the AFL Grand Final, so it's not too far out. Blue Bird Taxi's cost AUD 2.50 per trip to Seminyak Square and Village and AUD 5.00 to Kuta! Imagine trying to get a taxi in Melbourne for those prices. Great swimming pools, for kids, families and romantic couples, the restaurant provided an elaborate breakfast every morning (included in our room cost) and every meal we had there, be it lunch or dinner (or even just pizza) was thoroughly enjoyable. I can't wait to come back and be welcomed as we were... Thank you Tita and Team, you people made our trip so memorable! Best wishes!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The staff are fantastic, so friendly and welcoming. Couldn’t do enough for you. Especially Vita in guest relations she helped with my visa for Vietnam and is so friendly and kind.

The pool is fantastic, gym is good and the breakfast buffet is unbelievable. It has such great variety and tastes good too! My mum loved her time there which was the most important thing to me, so couldn’t recommend this hotel enough! Will definitely return one day.

Thanks for a great time,

261,Closed market charge what they like,30,October 2019,"Honestly it’s a beautiful hotel, but they charge like wounded bulls for everything. It’s a closed market so you have to pay.

Beer is 2-3 times the price on average to most other resorts/bars in town. Taxis are a set price no negotiations. My understanding was everything is negotiable but not there. We used grab (indo Uber) in the end for transport as it was getting ridiculous, even the local cabs back were demanding the set fees.
Watch your credit card and bills to they are happy to charge but slow to refund.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
262,Great Place to Stay,50,October 2019,"We have recently spent 10 days on a family reunion holiday in 5 of the rooms.

The hotel is lovely, clean and modern and the staff incredible. They were always welcoming, friendly and willing to help. We traveled with twin 4 year olds and they were treated like gold with daily hi fives and cuddles by all the staff with a very special mention of Tita who captured their hearts, she was so kind and generous to them 💗

The facilities are awesome a spectacular pool, great varied and vast daily breakfast buffet and the added treat of a Spa.

Thank-you to all the staff who made our Bali trip extra special, we loved it.

263,Cathy O,30,August 2019,Rooms are nice and clean overlooking the pool. Good bed. Long way from anywhere cannot walk to restaurants etc Need to use taxis. Staff very friendly although some with very limited English. Recommend if you are happy to relax around the pool and bar but if you wish to see a bit of Seminyak I think you could do better.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
264,One of the Best Hotels in Seminyak Bali!!! Excellent customer service!!!,50,May 2019,"Recentley stayed in this hotel for a girls trip and from the very beginning of our stay, I could not fault it...I could not be more happier with not only the price, the service but the staff...are so attentive, really sweet and so polite!!! The Photos also dont do it justice, this hotel is incredible, always so clean, beds so comfy, quiet and all in the heart of Seminyak. Pools are huge and clean, highly recommended if you want to stay outside of the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Legian.....Excellent for families as they have family rooms which are huge! and the breakfast buffet....is amazing! so much food, you dont even know where to start!!!

Not only were the staff incredible but there was one Manager by the name of Agus who stood out to us the most, anything we needed or fixed he was always the first the come through, so polite and even moved our rooms when we had issues with our showers and safe even though it was minor, and so so lovely!!! Agus made our holiday that much more relaxed. Thank you for your excellent service Agus!!! I'll be sure to keep recommending my clients and family aswell as friends to your hotel 😊",Primera Hotel Seminyak
265,Good place,40,September 2019,"I love Ramada. From their bed which is big enough for me and my sister. The pool was amazing, food was great and I have nothing but praises for their staffs especially the housekeeping team. We were always in a hurry and would wake up too early to pick up our mess so we would always request for a make up room and whenever we are back at the hotel it feels so good to be greeted with a clean room and complete toiletries. Ramada Encore, you definitely made our stay a comfortable one. I just hope that whoever was cleaning the room we stayed in got that little something we left for him/her.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
266,Unexpectedly suprised,40,September 2019,"When we first checked in our initial thought was your standard 3 star hotel, nothing fancy but exactly what you pay for. We had a room on the bottom floor that you walk out to the pool,this was a great way to start and end each day. The room again was your standard room. We had friends staying on the 4th floor who had a full size fridge and little kitchen but the rest was similar. The breakfast was delicious, such wonderful staff! By the second day the breakfast staff knew my name and room number and absolutely loved when we spoke to them in Balinese. They knew our coffee order and stir fry order, they were always up for a chat. The spa is a delight! Looked lovely, very clean and so many options. The prices were your cheap hotel price but then there was also a massive discount included making a couples massage around $15 for an hour. If you love a massage the “4 hands” is the way to go! Don’t go here is you want a fancy hotel but if you want bang for your buck this is the one for you. It was further out so you did need to travel but in a bluebird taxi it will cost you between $2.5-6 to get anywhere in Seminyak, legion.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
267,Ramada Encore Hotel experience,40,September 2019,"First we discuss the best part:
1. Pool was excellent
2. Breakfast buffet was also good.
3. Ambience n front desk staff was very supportive.

Now what not works:
1. Hotel was little inside the lane so you must call the Cab or use Hotel paid cab or add your name in free shuttle in a day 3-4 times.

2. Just because of 1 Indian family was did wrong in Bali Hotel does'nt mean every Indian family is travelling just for collect things from your Hotel.
Even a small Tea spoon was missing just because it was go with other cutlery you guys said written a letter with reason why the spoon missing...not digest.

3. Rooms are average size not too big, without balcony.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

271,Amazing Resort!!,50,September 2019,"My wife and I stayed at Ramada for 8 nights and we absolutely loved it. The hotel is stunning and such an enjoyable place to be around. The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful with anything you need. We booked the double/twin room and were surprised when we arrived, they gave us a free upgrade to a queen room that was pool side, at no additional cost. The room is very clean and the room service comes everyday and makes the bed and cleans which is very nice as well. Our room was closer to the restaurant side and at times you can hear noise from the restaurant in the room. The rooms aren’t the most sound proof but it didn’t bother us too much. Upon booking you can choose to have breakfast included or not for a additional cost. I would highly highly recommend booking with the breakfast. The breakfast is buffet style with heaps of options to choose from. They have Indonesian cuisine, Indian curries, a salads bar, fresh fruit, an egg making station. They also have a more western style breakfast area with cereal, toast, pastries and each day they alternate crepes, waffles or pancakes. They also have a few espresso coffee machines. We found the coffee to be not very good, but they do have a coffee station where you can purchase better coffee. Such as flat white, latte, cappuccino, etc..
We found the pool area to be such a relaxing and enjoyable place to just spend the whole day laying in the sun and swimming. Some days when we were out we wished we were back at the hotel. The hotels shuttle service was the cherry on top with this hotel. Every day they have multiple shuttles that will take you to Seminyak square or beach as well as Kuta square. There’s multiple drop off times and just one pick up time in the evening at 4:30pm for Seminyak and 5:30pm for Kuta. The shuttle service is excellent if you’re not wanting to spend a lot of money on transport. The hotel also offers airport pickup and drop off.
We will highly recommend this hotel to anyone and if we go back to Bali might even stay there again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
272,Excellent place to stay with family,50,September 2019,"We had a very spacious 3 bedroom apartment, with 2 bathrooms, a large fridge, kitchen facilities, including fresh water tower, dining table and lounge area that overlooked the beautiful big pool. The room was very well maintained with fresh towels being delivered every day and a quick clean of the rooms, with beds made as well. Have to say that the beds were super comfortable, as well as the pillows! It was home away from home for us for 10 amazing fun filled Bali days!! The staff were incredibly friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.
Service was exemplary! Food was enjoyable and plenty of variety to choose from. Only a 10 min drive into Legian in cheap Blue Bird Taxi. Staff were very happy to arrange transport anytime of the day/night too. Hotel was well away from the hustle and bustle and for most part, was very quite at night. Any issues regarding noise at night were attended to promptly by reception. There was onsite security for the hotel around the clock, so always felt very safe staying there. Would highly recommend this Resort to anyone wanting to stay in Seminyak. 10/10 Gold Stars! :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Surely will recommend",Primera Hotel Seminyak
288,Solid hotel for the price,40,September 2019,"public areas are well maintained and relaxing. On site spa is also worth a visit. Staff are very friendly. Buffet breakfast was decent with a good selection. Other food is also tasty and reasonably priced, 50-100k. Drink prices are ok, cocktail happy hour (which is most of the day) is good, select cocktails end up being around 30k. The only real let down is the beer prices, which are about 55k. Unfortunately I feel this price ultimately also impacts the atmosphere as it's just not worth paying that much for beer, which people would be more like to do around the pool. They also don't allow grab pickups (drop offs are ok), but that's pretty standard, I think most people just walk down the street to order them as it's much cheaper than using their services. But honestly that's my only two gripes. Well worth a stay!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
289,Bali Vacation,50,September 2019,"Hi all prospective visitors to Bali, v came from India on 7d/7n trip, which included stay in Ramada Encore Seminyak, stay in Ubud & Gili T.

291,Not so good.,30,August 2019,"We booked executive suite and the room that we got was not like executive suite. Our view from balcony was blocked by trees, we asked to change the room but there was no response from the staff so it wasn't worth spending that much money for an executive suite.
Also I wanted to extend my stay but even the rooms were available, staff didn't extended. But when I saw online rooms were available then I booked online through third party website.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Every single staff from concierge, reception, guest relation dept, housekeeping, restaurant, security, pool guys....are the most lovely, genuine, friendly, polite, cheerful, passionate people.

We will be back next year and will stay in Ramada Encore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
296,Ramada Encore,30,July 2019,"Quite a nice hotel, we found it a bit far out from the shops and beaches so taxis were expensive. The food was fair to average and breakfast wasn’t included and if you wanted a good coffee you had to pay for it. The staff were very nice, however they put us in the wrong room on arrival. They did move us but we had no balcony. If you wanted extra tea bags or coffees you had to pay for them. The pool looked lovely, however it got very little sun and was so cold. I would not stay there again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The memorable experience begins from the point you arrive at the hotel with a Balinese welcome. The staff are absolutely wonderful and pleasant. Their greetings made us feel most welcome and relaxed.

We have eaten here for lunch and dinner and always been happy with the service and the food and the prices are very reasonably. Highly recommend!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
303,Baliness The END of our Tour,40,February 2019,"Hello,
This was the end of our ten days visit of Bali. We stayed here for two nights and the food was OK and the quality of service is also average but the charmless at the reception is better then else. One thing which we didnt liked was not to force anyone for your spa treatmeant as they were literally forcing to use it. Rest second thing should not ask people to put room keys and all stiff just for towels which were old and toned.
The only Front desk was showing kindness but we waited for long to get the room.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
304,Worst Hotel to stay in Bali,10,August 2019,"The staff of the hotel wasn't friendly at all (They are racist and the service you get depends on your skin color).

They have 1 broken pool table which they won't let you use, no matter what. They have got this weird policy that you can't play pool unless you have ordered food right now with atleast 10$ (which means even if you have ordered earlier sometime in a day for 100$, it doesn't get counted, Weird) On top of it, even if you order they will find 1000 reasons for you to not use it.

I had booked 3 rooms for 4 days and at the time of checkout, receptionist is saying 2 coffee mugs are missing from my room without even checking the same in other rooms (Which they eventually found in other room obviously). Stop branding your customer as thieves. On the other instance, the room cleaner didn't let my friends leave the room for checkout unless they verified the entire room. I haven't seen such things anywhere else.

Another thing, if you planning to use Grab/Uber/Go-jek or any other online cab aggregator, you can't do that. They have some tie ups with local area goons who don't let these cabs to get into the hotel and forcefully you are bound to use hotel/local transport at 3 times the price of Grab/Uber/Go-jek.

I would say it was the worst experience of my life within any 4* property (Even 2* or 3* are better then Ramada encore Bali).

Avoid it, No matter what.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
305,Encore is the best!!!,50,August 2019,"We had so much fun enjoying the food the facilities of the hotel and of course the service of the staff.. specialy Vita,Dewi and yudi they are all accomodating and lovely. we're surely come back soon🙂 all the way from the Phillipines!

I enjoyed my first honeymoon there and I would recommend it to anyone and definitely come back again. I will never forget you “Tita” thank you so much dear.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
307,Excellent and Serene Place,40,July 2019,"Location of the hotel is set up in serene surroundings, all the staff members are very cordial and made our stay very comfortable, would definitely recommend it to my friends.

Only downside is that one has to take taxi if one wants to check out other touristy places, never the less the hotel is highly recommended.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
308,Isolated,30,August 2019,"Clean modern and friendly staff,great breakfast,great pool and the meals were ok at a reasonable price.There were a few nice rice fields within a 10 minute walk.On the downside dining service was a bit slack and the hotel is isolated,very few restaurants and no touristy things within easy walking distance .Its a taxi ride anywhere you want to go.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
309,Excellent Hotel stay,50,September 2018,"Had an excellent stay at Ramada mainly due to the hospitable staff. They went over and beyond to ensure that we have a great time in Bali. Special mention to their team member Tita who helped in arranging a very nice day trip to Nusa Penida on such a short notice. Further, later when we forgot our stuff in hotel she ensured that it is safeguarded and handed over to us !!

Totally recommended this super comfortable hotel with excellent staff (Specially Tita)",Primera Hotel Seminyak

i want to thank Mrs. Tita for her great customer service, she assisted us in booking the activities and upgrated our room as well.

But there is one person i specially want to mention is Ms. Putri. (We had booked a non refundable rooms somewhere in kuta and discovered that property was not at all what it showed like on internet. We were disappointed on multiple levels and could see our holidays getting ruined with compromised stay. ) Putri helped me to get this next to impossible cancellation done and i later continued my stay with Ramada encore seminyak. Me and my family are highly obliged by her gesture.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
314,Birthday Special :-),40,August 2019,"First of all, I would like to thank DEWI from reservations department for making my Birthday extra special during my stay. She arranged some balloons, towel arts, rose petals and specially a delicious cake. She ensured that my stay is perfect. An eye for every details makes the company look good.

I wanna thank YUNI, the pregant receptionist for upgrading my room to a Suite one. Although we arrived early and she said the room wasn't ready till 3pm. She made a surprise by a complimentary room upgrade. That was Superb! Again making customers happy.

Also to AGNUS, the receptionist, for giving me another key as I lost it without a charge.

And lastly to KRISTIN who always put a smile on her face and ensuring we have a fresh Crepe or waffles during breakfast.

The only Con part is the housekeeping team. Maybe the housekeeping staff should ensure that every side of the room is clean specially the bathroom if it smells. I don't want to elaborate more but the room was great!

I can say that you can stay at any fancy hotels but only few hotels are offering genuine service such as Ramada Encore. Again, Thank you!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

But kinda forced to choose transport, it only one option of transport in that private hotel road, so if you want to search for cheaper option, you must walk arround 500m. Well everything has a good side and downside, so cannot be to picky. Overall the place was good one for stay",Primera Hotel Seminyak
317,Average hotel,30,July 2019,The hotel as such is great but our bathroom was stinking and they did not do anything about it. The breakfast is great with good vegetarian options.

But the safe clearly says that it can be opened by the room card ! We asked to meet the manager pr talk to him and they said he was on his break . And we didn't get to talk to him ..

Special mention of Airk, who was managing the reception, she was very friendly and recommended me the best places to go. I felt very welcomed and comfortable due to her.

343,Very good hotel with Indian food,40,July 2019,"I stayed in Ramada for 4 nights with my family in July this year. This is a beautiful hotel. I liked everything except a few minor issues. On the first day we reached the hotel at 12 noon. Hotel checkin time is 3pm. This lady at the front desk by name TITA helped us by allowing us early checkin. Thank you TITA.
Many thanks to the hotel management for arranging an India Counter for buffet breakfast. This counter had vegetarian items. I like people who respect vegetarians.
During my stay in the hotel I realized that hotel had overcharged me during checkin. I reported this issue to front desk. It took a few days to get my refund. But I would like to thank TITA for all the help. She worked really hard to get my refund. She even shared her personal phone number to keep me updated on the progress. Once again many thanks to you TITA.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
344,Holiday,50,August 2019,"Great hotel to stay. Cheap with lots of positive attributes. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great breakfast buffet. Although a bit far from beach and shopping,the complimentary shuttle is really good for getting around to places.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
345,Good value,30,August 2019,"Good value for money. Very clean and staff is very friendly, particularly de concierge lady. But it is a bit far from the beach and can take 20 minutes by taxi to get to town and another 20-30 to get back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
346,Good Value and Nice Pool,40,October 2018,"Pros: Good room and hotel venue versus the budget they offer we stayed for 5 days for a really good value , room was clean standard room which will offer you all basics u will need, they upgraded our room to have a balcony and decorated our bed for our honeymoon pool was nice. they offer good massage too and you need to book it early as well

Cons: Shuttle bus options had limited seats so you better book day before and early , as We need to have a ride each time we want to go to the Main Street and market so it was a must for us.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
347,Great team with great service,50,July 2019,"Me and my husband stayed in Ramada Encore for a week. It was lovely staying here. Would like to thank Tita, Dewi and their team for making my and my husband's birthdays special with wonderful surprises. We will definitely return here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
348,"Bali Holiday July 22-27,2019",50,July 2019,We stayed here for 3 nights and let me tell you that our stay here was one of the best part of our Bali trip. It was my girlfriend’s birthday and I asked for a cake and they were so kind enough to give me some even though it was such a short noticed and I was in a rush. Their breakfast buffet is great.. Hospitable waiters and waitresses. Clean rooms. What else can I say? I would love to come back and stay bit longer here. Keep up the good work!🙂,Primera Hotel Seminyak
349,"Perfect stay, wonderful hotel!",50,July 2019,"Me and my girlfriend stayed in the Ramada Encore for ten nights and it was a wonderful experience.

At first I doubted if we would book just a few nights so we could travel a bit through bali and explore different parts of the island.

Eventually we decided to rent a scooter during our complete stay and this was an excellent choice. We went to Kuta, Ubud, the Garuda Wisnu Park and of course out for dinner by scooter and this gives you complete freedom to go wherever you want, when you want.

The hotel offers everything you need, 24 hours a day and the staff does everything they can to make your stay a succes. All staff members speak english and they’re always happy, warm and ready to help out with whatever you need.

We upgraded our room for around 9 euro a night to have a balcony and this was well worth it. It’s really relaxed to be able to hang your swimwear to dry and to have a drink or read a book in the evening on your own balcony.

We went to the beach a few times and out for dinner most of the days but the restaurant and swimmingpool in the hotel are both great.

To the wonderful team of Ramada Encore Seminyak Bali, thank you for everything!

Robin en Veerle",Primera Hotel Seminyak
350,Fantastic,50,July 2019,"We were in bali for 1 week and we stayed at 2 different hotels while in Bali, this is the best stay we had. We spent the day at the hotel by enjoying the swimming pool which is located in front of our room, they also have a gym center near to the pool. The menu for breakfast was various and excellent. The staff are helpful and friendly.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
351,one of the best places I have stayed in Bali,50,July 2019,"Excellent pool, food and of course drinks! The staff go above a beyond with their service. Everyone will remember your name from the moment u walk in, always smiling and making sure your stay is perfect. It’s away from nightlife, restaurants (apart from theirs) and places to shop but a $2 blue taxi will see u there in a few minutes. We will be back again!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
352,Aircon was not working,30,August 2019,"This is our first stay. The room was Ok. Only the aircon was not working. We checked in at 6pm and left the room by 7. But the room is still not cool. So we left with the aircon on, but when we're back still not cool at all so callled the technician to repair it and it's working and cool. But few hours later, not working again. Sigh.

The restaurant is good. Love the ambience and the staff. Food also good and at reasonable price. But we think that this hotel is not recommended for family with children.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
353,Great Value,50,August 2019,"Nice welcome, good checkin, excellent rooms, comfortable beds, great amenities and warm, friendly and welcoming staff. Food and service was good and breakfast great.

This is a great place to stay and highly recommended.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
354,Staff Service A1,50,July 2019,"The staff at this resort are so courteous and helpful. A very special mention to a beautiful lady Dewie, she is a valuable employee and went out of her way to make sure all our needs were met, hope Ramada recognize what a fantastic employee she is. I would also like to thank Tio who greeted us every morning at breakfast with a smile she is also an asset to the resort. I cannot fault Ramada, loved the food, the pool and the accommodation. It may be tucked away in a quiet area, which we loved, but is not to far by transport to Legian, Kuta etc. Would definitely recommend, so much so that we have booked another holiday in September with our family. Again this holiday has been arranged with the amazing Dewie, she is a gem. Looking forward to returning in a couple of weeks.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
355,Think twice,20,August 2019,"After a late arrival I was welcomed... once formalities were over (passport copies etc) I made my own way to my room. I booked a deluxe balcony room with pool view. When I arrived the room was on the ground floor had no balcony and looked out onto a drinks bar blocking the pool view. I could not sit on the sofa due to a large stain which was still slightly damp. The decor was average but ok. No face washer to wash my face. The mini fridge was hot and the gauge did not work. The next morning I requested to be moved. The desk clerk stated that they had upgraded me, I kindly asked to be placed in the balcony room that I booked. I was moved and the balcony room on the 3rd floor although the same layout had a decent balcony with pool view. The breakfast is decent and caters for several nationalities. The coffee is good. Room service is 24 hours and has a varied menu. Overall i rate it a 3 star not the 4 that it is rated on booking .com... will I return? Probably not due to the competitive and vast amount of accomodation throughout Seminyak",Primera Hotel Seminyak
356,Very comfortable and friendly place,50,July 2019,"We had booked 3 double rooms for our family for 6 nights in early July.
Right from the airport pick up arrangements by the hotel with two spacious cars, everything went like clockwork.
The rooms were very large with a good size balcony and pool views, extremely comfortable, well appointed with all standard amenities and great air conditioning.

The breakfast was an absolute delight with such a huge range of hot food as well as freshly made noodles, rice, eggs whatever you want cooked in front of you, a massive range of bakery products, local as well other sweets, fruits, salads, juices, coffee and tea and a pancake/pikelet/waffle stand every day. Barista brewed coffee available at an extra cost. You simply cannot ask for more.

Their menu items for lunch and dinner were extremely nice too and at a very affordable price. The elaborate drinks/cocktails menu too with an excellent happy hour discount on drinks.

The spa had very caring staff, the massages and beauty treatments were value for money. A small extra to pay compared to the cost in the markets but you get what you pay for in a super clean, spacious and nice environment instead of the dingy and dark dodgy looking places out in the streets.

The hotel staff are so warm and friendly, going out of the way to please you and take the effort to know you by name.

It is located a bit inside but quite central. Taxis and cars are available on call in a jiffy with help from the hotel staff and the rates are very reasonable, on par with outside rates without the need to haggle.

Free shuttle is available a few times a day and you pay about $5-7 Aud for a return trip back from the busy central area which is about 3-4 km from the hotel.

The international airport is less than 10 km away and costs about $20 Aud for a spacious 6 seater car.

Overall Ramada Encore is a lovely place and we had a very pleasant stay there.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
357,Thank you,50,July 2019,Very amazing hotel with friendly staff I liked and i like the breakfast but i need some middle east food and the pool is very amazing and the pasta and pizza very yummy 🤤 and the desserts are wonderful thank you for everything 💕,Primera Hotel Seminyak
358,Comfortable stay,50,July 2019,"We stayed at Ramada Encore for two nights. The stay was pleasantly comfortable. I wish we had more time to explore the property. The balcony overlooked the pool area which in particular was beautiful and quite peaceful.

I felt that the rooms could have been a little more spacious but overall very well planned property with courteous and helpful staff.

While there are numerous options of properties with a more scenic view in Bali, if you are looking for a brief stay in Seminyak, would definitely recommend this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
359,My first stay at ramada encore bali,50,August 2019,"A really nice hotel, warm welcome from the moment we arrived and great services from the staff,nice pool,great location and surprisingly the varieties of breakfast menu,will be back for sure, this hotel is highly recommended",Primera Hotel Seminyak
360,Friendly!,40,July 2019,"location is great, staff is friendly and helpful, and the pool is nice. The only (major) drawback is sound isolation in the rooms. Our little family (a couple with an infant) kept waking up in the night due to casual talks in the floor corridors and from neighbor rooms.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
361,4days stay,40,July 2019,"The pool is nice..the pillows are so comfy. The staff are very helpful and approachable..they got varieties of food for breakfast.
The hotel is quite far from resto and bars. The room that we stayed is quite okay for the price. Will definitely book this hotel again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
362,Relaxing Holiday,40,August 2019,"Visited Bali many times, seen everything, done almost everything, now we just come to relax and we did just that here at the Remada Encore Seminyak.
The Remada staff are the most accommodating out of all the Resorts and Hotels we have stayed in.
I realised that this was my favourite thing out of my entire 10 day trip!! The beautiful people.
A little far out from civilisation but a cheap taxi ride or free shuttle and you are in the hustle and bustle within 5 minutes.
For the price we paid, we couldn’t ask for more!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
363,The Bali 8 Crew,50,July 2019,"Arrived on 24th July to be warmly greeted by the lovely “Tita”. our 10 day stay was absolutely sublime, rooms perfect with direct pool access as requested, clean facilities and all amenities on hand. Meals in restaurant second to none. Big shout out to our waiters “Yogi” and “Aku” who were just the best. All receptionists staff and management were so friendly helping us with any enquiry, from scooter hire, laundry service and other info. “vita” your a little gem.

The 8 of us all had the best experience thank you to all the staff at Ramada we will recommend and we will be back soon for another great holiday experience.

365,Fantastic,50,July 2019,"Was absolutely amazing ..., it is a little bit out of Seminyak but a short taxi ride and you are in the heart at Seminyak Square. The staff rooms pool and food is fantastic ... nothing find too much trouble ... would not hesitate to stay again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
366,Excellent Service and Great Food,50,July 2019,We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. I love the warm welcome and very passionate staff. There was wide variety of food during breakfast. The only problem is that you cannot book grab to pick you up at the hotel because there’s a local public transport in the area.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
367,Not what we expected...,30,July 2019,"Having arrived for my 28th visit to Bali and only booking 3 days earlier we were extremely disappointed in the location of this property.

This is not a hotel for first time travellers to Bali as you cannot walk out from the hotel and go shopping. You need to use the shuttle service or grab a taxi (organised by hotel) and pay a premium for it.

A big Thank You to Tita, the Guest Relations Officer who came to the rescue and saved this holiday. I can’t praise her enough for going out of her way to sort out our room etc.

Very extensive breakfast which was a huge bonus.

I was surprised to see towels left on sun beds by guests for the entire day without them being removed. A bit unfair for other hotel guests as there is limited area by the pool to begin with.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

370,"Rude staff, poor service",10,July 2019,"Very poor service. Staff is rude, not at all friendly. We ordered food in the restaurant and they say it will take one hour for the preparation. For house keeping also they don't come timely. I have never seen this kind of behaviour in a star property like this.
Rooms are also just OK.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
371,holiday,50,July 2019,"Everything just fine, room just standart, breakfast has alot of selection , for the taste just average. If traveling with family better take family room cause more spacious. Not much time cause staying only one night. but for the price is worth it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
372,Good place,30,July 2019,Overall the hotel is good as it is priced decently. It is located in seminyak in quite back lane. Staff are good and breakfast is decent.

(+) well designed lobby and pool
(+) havent try their spa, gym and food, but i think it should be good as well
(+) good location that connects Sunset Road and Seminyak
(+) efficient staff and clean room

(-) the room is just okay. in size and design
(-) ordering online based taxi is almost impossible since the hotel located next to local taxi pool. Bluebird might work, but if its not really necessary, dont take the overpriced local taxi booked by the hotel",Primera Hotel Seminyak
374,Average hotel,20,July 2019,"Good value for money if one needs a place to sleep.
- booked a superior room. On arrival, surprised to see there was no balcony
- service was poor. Our room wasn’t made up although we requested for it early morning & arrived at 7 pm.
- food was average so was entertainment (one person singing without a band).
- not close to beach.
Didn’t find any charming aspects to this place.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
375,A fantastic stay,50,July 2019,"This was our first time travelling to Bali, and Ramada encore was the perfect hotel to stay at. Every staff member was so kind and helpful, and always said hello, which really helped make you feel at home. The food was also really great and at a great price.

Ramada Encore Seminyak transported us to a world of tranquility, from withing the Resort, you wouldn't guess that you are in the middle of bustling Seminyak. The housekeeping team was outstanding, led by their executive Housekeeper I gede Suriawan, they left nothing to chance making sure that rooms were impeccably clean. The food was superb, and with the restaurant open throughout the day, there was no need to venture outside for food. The Front Office staff are simply amazing, led by assistant FOM, I made Suarsadana, they go above and beyond to make sure that your stay is memorable, they certainly made ours a remarkable stay, from organising transport to booking tours, nothing is too hard for them. If you are around the lobby area you will not miss lovely Tita, the guest relations officer, as she does her rounds looking for anyone to help. The whole team works like a well-oiled machine, credits to the management. After 8 nights we were very sad to leave, but we will definitely coming back.

The best part about the hotel though is the staff. I have never stayed anywhere were all members of staff learn your name and genuinely care about you having a brilliant time. Tita helped us out so much throughout our trip - she is amazing!
For the price you won't find a place better to stay in Seminyak. You can book all of your trips from the hotel and they even have fantastic drivers of their own to take you out wherever you want for such a reasonable price.
Having travelled twice to Bali and stayed in 6/7 different places, I can say without a doubt that if we go back to Bali, we wouldn't stay anywhere else!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

394,Home base,40,June 2019,"Throughly enjoyed my stay at Ramada Encore. I got the shuttle from the airport to the hotel and even though my flight was delayed they were still there. For those first time to Bali I recommend as you are swamped with taxi drivers calling you.

The hotel has everything you need. The spa on the top floor has a happy hour so I spent some time there. The pool area is large so you can find somewhere hidden away or right by the restaurant area. The gym has everything you need for a good work out. It’s accessible 24hours you just need your room key to get in.

I had a little issue with the pick up of the free shuttle and they were so apologietic to me. They gave me a free trip to the airport on departure, gave me a sarong and kept checking in on me. Great customer service.

I stayed here for 9 days and extended it to 13 in the end. The staff will remember your name and are very attentive. Nothing nicer than been greeted by a smile and your name.

I would recommend, solo, couples, groups or families. It has something for everyone. I’ll be back for sure. Thanks Ramada for a lovely stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
395,Awesome/amazing/outstanding service,50,June 2019,"Wow!! What an amazing place to stay for our first time to Bali. Everyone is so friendly and go above and beyond to help you.

Breakfast buffet was excellent even chocolate cake was available.

I would like to mention Agus our waiter at the restaurant he is awesome!! So helpful and patient when we couldn't decide on what to eat as there is so much to choose from.

Also Santika our ""cleaner boy"" another outstanding employee who was so friendly and kind it was nice chatting to him every morning on our way out.

397,perfect place for us :),50,June 2019,"We decided to stay at Ramada for our short break. We booked last minute thru their website and had a free room upgrade upon arrival, thank you :) The room is spacious for us to share with our son, with a terrace overlooking the pool. The minus is the room is quite faraway, next time we want to stay closer to the elevator with the same view (if the said room does exist lol)

what we didn't expect was they do serve delicious and wide range of food there. We had food delivered to our room within a timely manner, well done. All staffs are friendly and polite, start from arrival, room service attendant and departure.

Just 1 thing that we don't understand. We wanted to play pool but informed that to do so, we must have minimum spend at the restaurant. We said to the waitress that we are in-house guest but didn't change anything. we ended up swimming....

overall, our family won't mind to visit again :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
398,We did NOT order the food,20,June 2019,"On arrival night while dining we noticed a couple waiting for their food and when it arrived there were 2 mains and a pizza, they said that they did not order pizza but the waiter said they did, ""we don't want it"" ...the waiter said but you ordered it and he just would NOT leave and stood beside this couple for 5 minutes and although upset the couple tried to ignore him and eventually he left, l was imbarrassed for them and l couldn't believe 2 nights later they did the same to us over pasta, by the time the waiter left ... 5 minutes, our 2 other meals were only just warm. It is a misunderstanding on 1 part or the other but no waiter until now has stood there and argued with the customers for 5 minutes over the food, just take the food away. This was twice in 2 days that l saw so it must be very regular in the restaurant and is very bad customer relations and they need talking to. So many lovely workers there and only a few not so good. It is a shame that we probably won't return as many others, upsetting and embarassing!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
399,Best choice,50,June 2019,"I've been stayed here two times. And will definitely go back if I visited Bali again. The room was huge, and the pool is really nice. You can just enjoy the time staying at this hotel. Thanks for the service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
400,Excellent Services,50,June 2019,"During our 3 days stay, we experienced excellent treatment by each and every members of staff.
My one suggestion is that Tag of Halal foods must be there. If possible Halal Foods' s corner should be separate.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
401,Stay nice with friends,50,June 2019,We enjoy a lot in hotel. The staff was very specialty Ms. Tita. We are happy to stay here. Room was very clean and spacious. Breakfast was great.

403,Fantastic place to stay.,50,October 2018,"This hotel is not on the coast but the facilities and great food make up for this. The pool area caters for everyone
Need to catch cabs to most areas Seminyak, Kuta etc but very quiet and relaxing place to stay",Primera Hotel Seminyak
404,One of the best family hotel,40,June 2019,"One of the best family hotel in bali. The room is quite spacious. The restaurant foods are good. Nice bfast. One little note. Ask for bacon every morning and sometimes have to wait 30 mins before we get it. Have dinner in the hotel almost every nite, some of the waiter are just strange. Instead of asking for ""table for how many ppl?"" they would ask how can i help u? And when we said we wanna have dinner where can we sit? They just left us to find table ourselves. That happen in the first three nite we were there. My first visit were more enjoyable. But we might still come back for the third visit. Stayed there for 7 nites.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
405,"Excellent , Highly Recommended",50,June 2019,"Certainly a great hotel to stay with your family or friends . Great service and hospitality, excellent breakfast variety , very good comfortable rooms , and in a quite area in Semiyak area . The location of hotel is 10 mins driveable distance from the main area of Seminyak. You need a vehicle to get out . Luckily we had rented a bike which is cheap and the hotel arranged this for us .

Highly recommended !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
406,Lovely stay,40,June 2019,"Stayed here for 7 nights which was considered as a long stay so you receive discounts on F&B and the spa, a late check out for free and a gift at the end! I stayed with my partner in a pool access room which was very nice. I would say it’s more for a family stay as lots of children but this didn’t bother us! Buffet breakfast was amazing and the free shuttle bus was a nice touch as you are a little out of the way of the centres",Primera Hotel Seminyak
407,"Nice place, well priced, stay relaxed !",50,May 2019,"Go for the room with balcony with a view of the meandering swimming pool. The restaurant on the lobby level has some good choice of Balanise fusion cuisine and a wide selection of cocktails. Located at a lonely distance from the Seminyak beach, however, local taxis and UBER taxis are not permitted by the hotel for a pick-up and hence one will need to pay high for the hotel taxi services.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
408,Teribble 2320 and staff didn't help much,10,June 2019,"Teribble 2320 room, I have 2 kids and found the room with the broken tile . I booked for 2 days. I just checked in on 3 june and just drop my luggage. And second day I checked in and found it. Staff FO didn't help much when I asked to change the other room even I want to upgrade the room and pay it",Primera Hotel Seminyak
409,Nice property,40,July 2018,Visited Bali last year and stayed in this hotel for two nights. Good hotel with all modern amenities. I would consider this as value for money option. I would recommend this place for mid budget travellers.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
410,Amazing place and so well priced,50,May 2019,"We stayed here for 1 night on our way back from Lembongan. The rooms were clean and large, the staff were great and the hotel was really nice. We often come to bali and will 100% be staying here again for a longer stay next time. It’s a little bit out of Seminyak but only a few $ in a taxi. Highly recommend.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
411,Crispy Duck. Absolutely magnificent.,50,August 2018,".Enjoyed the meal entirely. Loved the service and the cocktails. M duck was very crispy, juices and tasty. I ordered a beautiful meal and get it. Well done guys. We are staying here but we will be back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
412,Fantastic !,50,May 2019,"Great hotel with massive pool, yummy restaurant and fast WiFi. What stands out the most for me is the staff, the friendliest bunch you'll ever meet.
The buffet breakfast spread is huge and delicious.
Came here last year for the first time and couldn't wait go come back, just returned from my second visit and feel like part of the family, can't wait to go back again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
413,Family stay,40,May 2019,Hotel is beautiful. The staff are the best that I have come across with all my stays in Bali. Food is delicious and the breakfast there is amazing. Staff are very good with children. Definitely stay again,Primera Hotel Seminyak
414,Above nu expectation,50,May 2019,"Good food, superb service, amazing approach of the staff ( probably because of the culture), high level of hygiene (rooms, restaurant etc.)
The most amazing people in the restaurant I had to meet are Nanda and Sunar the f&b manager. Also, the others are very kind people but I coildnt remember their names. A great pleasure to stay here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

location is very good , facilities great pool nice new gym , nice crowd from allover the world stay , and value for money , i strongly suggest this hotel , planning to stay again for my next long trip in august september october , thank you once again to the whole hotel staff !!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
416,Best breakfast made by Made,50,May 2019,"Made did make us the best noodles and fried vegetables during breakfast. She is also very nice and friendly. Nice pool, especially by night. Also the other staff always wear a smile on their face. I liked my stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
417,Could have been better,30,May 2019,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 days recently and found the hotel to be average. The room was good, clean and well furnished. We enjoyed the daily buffet breakfast, which had a wide range to choose from. We also enjoyed the Indonesian food in the restaurant like Nasi Goreng, Mi Goreng and the Sateys, but the rest were just mediocre. The pool also was good, with few loungers placed in its shallow end.

The overall look and feel of the hotel was good, but nothing impressive. One major disappointment was the Wifi signal in the room. It was terrible. While booking the hotel you are also not informed about the IDR 500,000/- refundable deposit, which is to be paid while check in, and they accept only IDR. So be prepared.

Another drawback would be its location. It is located down a dark and quiet alley and could feel a bit intimidating if wandering about alone. To reach any reliable money exchange, there is a fair bit of walk from here.

This area has a “No online taxi” policy, like in many parts of Bali. Online taxis like Grab can only drop passengers here. You are not allowed to book a taxi to pick you up from the hotel. I was once asked to board my grab taxi from outside hotel premises. The taxis booked through the hotel are way too expensive.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
418,"Tremendous hotel, couldn’t recommend enough!",50,May 2019,"Recently checked into the Ramada for 3 nights, however soon extended this to 6 nights! The hotel itself is very well looked after, from the rooms, to the pool and bar/restaurant area.

I would highly recommend adding the breakfast to your booking, it’s exceptional and offers a great variety to suit everyones needs. We also found the food at the restaurant in the evening was of great variety and quality.

The staff (all of them) are marvellous. Super friendly and helpful! I must note a special mention to Tita, her assistance throughout our whole stay was exceptional! She constantly went over and above to assist the guests of the hotel. Tita is a credit to the hotel and I could not thank her enough for all she done.

I note some reviews found the location as a negative, however it’s around £1.50 to Seminyak square and a taxi arrives within minutes. I didn’t find the location a problem at all. In fact, it was quite nice to be away from the lively Seminyak.

This is an honest review and I can guarantee you won’t regret your choice if you decide to book the Ramada.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
419,The most relaxing holiday.......ever,50,May 2019,"We had a pool access room, staying for 10 days and what a great experience.

We had breakfast included which had everything you could possibly wish for, in a good breakfast. If you want a latte or cappuccino it is an extra $2-50 but was definitely worth it as the house coffee was average.

The room was well appointed, with a comfortable bed and the house keeping kept everything clean and replenished. The staff (I mean all the staff) were extremely helpful, polite and attentive. If we needed something, they were quick to deliver it.

They knew our first names within days of us staying there. Their attention to customer service is to be commended.

The couple of draw backs to this place is:

*It is about about a 20 minute walk to the shops which is not a straight walk and crossing roads we found a challenge as a zebra crossing means nothing.

*This place is isolated from everywhere else.... so you either have to walk or catch a taxi

*The dinner menu is so extensive that it is impossible to cook everything well. It would be better to have less and ‘master’ those and make them exceptional. Most dishes were very average with us chiding to eat out every night.

Overall, I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and will definitely be back, if I have my way.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
420,Excellence Services,50,May 2019,"I was stayed in Ramada Encore for 2 nights and it was totally good experience.

First of all, they give me a very warm greetings and I was assisted by FO staff named Vita (hopefully not mistaken)...

She greeted me very good and I was so amazed by the services she gave. She walks down to the aisle, and accompanied me to my room. And surprisingly, it was upgraded to Pool View Room (even still in the same category), but I can see the beautiful pool view from my window.

The pool was very good, but too windy when I came.
Cleanliness is OK.

At the day I have to leave, Ms. Vita still recognise and remember my name. That makes me feel so WOOW 😁

Keep do the good things, team..
Sure will come back soon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
421,Ramada Bali May,50,May 2019,"Hotel is excellent.. i think for the price is super cool me and my girlfriend are super happy with the service.. rooms are clean , food is also good. All recommendations . I think is the best price for the quality 😊",Primera Hotel Seminyak

424,excellent,50,May 2019,we love staying here. the room is cozy. breakfast is great with lots of selection. staffs are friendly and helpful. we are spending most of the time in the pool and kids playground. (they have xbox and playstation :p ).,Primera Hotel Seminyak
425,FOUND: A top BALI happy place,40,May 2019,"We booked in for 7 days and had a lovely time.
The resort offers very good value for money and don't be put off by the distance on the map from the beach & shops, as there are plenty of taxis available to get you almost everwhere within a few minutes & for only $3AUD, which the staff will call and book for you with only a maximum 5 min wait.

The pool was big, quiet and beautifully cool with plenty of seats, beanbags and recliners scattered around and a free towel service. Always plenty of staff to offer poolside drinks. Also a childrens end - quite shallow and warm.
We booked in for a pool side deluxe room with ensuite,(recommended on 1st floor) with seated balcony and it was a decently sized, comfortable room.
The breakfast was very good (although we did have to pay extra for coffee machine lattes $25000 rp - $2.50 Aust. each day) which we felt should really be complimentary. We only ate dinner once there but it was good & reasonably priced with a lovely resturant vibe, romantically lit with cool chill music.
The staff are all lovely and the day spa was fabulous and excellent value with happy hr specials every day on massages etc.

There is also a pool table & a small gym for guest use.
Overall excellent value for your Bali holiday, lovely staff with a happy and chilled atmosphere, comfortable rooms and resort vibe. We will be back every year now, we have found our happy place in Seminyak.
Thank you Ramada - this is how its done.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
426,Wonderful place to visit,50,May 2019,"My family and I stayed at this hotel recently and had a wonderful visit. Our holiday was made all the more special by the attention the staff gave to our granddaughter Sophia. Nothing was too much trouble for them and when my husband was ill for a few days the care and attention given to him was much appreciated. Staff even phoned the room a few times to check on his progress. The hotel itself was very clean and well maintained. The pool was beautiful with always plenty of sun loungers available. We ate many times both lunch time and evening here and was never disappointed with the food.There was plenty of it, it was well presented and service was always excellent. We are definitely hoping to return to this hotel in the future. I have to give a special mention to Tita who was a massive part of our holiday. She was so kind and helpful and always did her job professionally and with a big smile at all times. We can’t thank you enough for making our holiday extra special. Sophia and us feel we have made a friend for life. Other staff I have to mention is Linda, Tio, Novi, Micky,Sujan and Agus. I am sorry I didn’t get everyone s name for those I have left out. You were also an important part of our holiday making us so welcome. Sophia sends her love to you all. We will remember you and Ramada Encore fondly.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
427,Great Value for Money! Great Hotel and Friendly Staff!,50,May 2019,This hotel is amazing. It is me and my boyfriends first time in Bali and we stayed at Ramada Encore Hotel in seminyak. The location is perfect as it is close to restaurants approx. 5-10 minutes walk. The hotel is clean and the staffs are really friendly. We always get greeted as soon as we enter the hotel. I asked them to decorate the room for my boyfriends birthday as a surprise and they said Yes without any hesitation and also gave us a free cake. He loved it! There is also a free drop off and pick up to Seminyak and Kuta Square. The pool is amazing and also the breakfast selections. Facilities are great. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to visit Bali and especially wants to stay at seminyak. Loved our stay. Will come back again.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
428,Great place to visit,50,May 2019,A clean and beautiful hotel to visit.

Tita Prawesti Ramada encore relation officer was very courteous and helpful.
Hope to visit it again 😊",Primera Hotel Seminyak
433,Great service compensates for slightly out of the way location,40,April 2019,"I stayed at the Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak for three nights during a trip around SE Asia.

The hotel is located in Seminyak but is not particularly close to the beach or the main bar/restaurant scene in the area. It is around a 25-30 minute walk to get to Seminyak Square although the hotel does offer a free shuttle at certain times of the day. I found it easier to order a blue bird taxi to get around which generally cost about 30k IDR.

My room was not ready upon arrival although I did come before their designated check in time and they had the room available for me around an hour after I arrived. The check in process was a little slow however the staff at the hotel were very attentive and helpful for the duration of my stay. They know you by name and always ask how you are, where you are going and if you need any help.

My room was of a good size, very clean and had the sort of facilities you would expect from a 4* hotel such as safe, slippers, bathroom amenities etc... My main issue was that my room was pool side on the ground floor and the pool bar plays loud music very early in the morning (around 8am) until closing time. The noise was audible in my room and in my opinion, 8am is far too early to be blasting music out considering there is a far larger number of guests trying to sleep at that point than being beside the pool.

That issue aside I would stay at this hotel again as despite the slightly further away location I found it to be good value for money for the size of the room and helpfulness of the staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
434,Amazing staff!!!,50,May 2019,"I recently stayed here , the hotel is fantastic , the food and service is spot on.. if there was one thing I could say that wasn’t the best is the AC .. but I enjoyed my stay .. I miss it already

436,Great service and accommodations,50,May 2019,"The hotel has a great pool area, very attentive service and good food. We ate both breakfast and dinner and enjoyed both. We took the free shuttle to Seminyak beach. It is too far to walk. Overall it was a great stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
437,Just amazing!!!!!,50,May 2019,"What can I say. This hotel was simply amazing. We stayed for 9 nights in a deluxe pool access room. It was perfect👌

From the moment we arrived, we felt like VIPs. All the staff were extremely friendly and were happy to help us achieve the best Holiday. Special shout out to Vita, who went out of her way to make us feel special. In particular, we celebrated my wife's birthday, and Vira and the staff went out of their way to make it a special day for us. Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou.🙏

The hotelI is around 2kms from Seminyak square, but this wasn't an issue as we could easily get a taxi or a car from Ronny Bali or KB. There are also 2 marts with a 5-10min walk of the hotel.

If you are looking for an oasis from the hustle and bustle, this is the hotel for you. The food is superb, drinks reasonably priced (great coffee too) and the pool is the best I have seen in a long time.

Thanks again to all the staff at Ramada for making us feel like family and helping us achieve a memorable holiday. We look forward to staying with you again soon. 😁😁😁

We all had an amazing time with excellent food and service. The staff were always polite and very helpful. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and we thought they were of a high standard. This stay was at the end of a long holiday as we stayed in Waikiki Hawaii then cruised for ten nights to Vancouver and stayed for 3 nights there. We are rating this stay with encore against 2 major hotels and a cruise ship.
We will definitely be coming back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
443,Amazing!,50,May 2019,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Ramada Encore during our stay to Bali. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by such lovely members of staff who were all helpful and willing to go that extra mile for us.

It was our anniversary and we were upgraded to the honeymoon suite, with decorations in the room, a note from the staff and even a cake!!

The pool was lovely and different, a tropical vibe and so relaxing. Again- the service around the pool we couldn’t fault- everyone was so helpful and kind to us.

A special shoutout to Tita- who was absolutely brilliant our whole trip. She helped us arrange trips, decorated the room for our anniversary, and even gave us a few leaving gifts! The whole team were amazing but Tita was always there smiling and being so kind.

Would 100% recommend to anyone, we will defiantly be returning.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Terima Kasih :-),Primera Hotel Seminyak
445,Ramada Encore - A comfortable stay,40,May 2019,"The check in was smooth. The room was well furnished and had clean linen and toiletries. There were two issues 1) They do not accept Euro/USD in cash if the money was printed before 2012. I found this strange because it is legal tender that they refused to accept. So we had to go to the bank, change the money to Indonesian Rupiah and pay the hotel. 2) The bellboy recommended a place for changing money. The rate, we later discovered, was better at the banks than this big money changer! So, use the bank or a money changer recognised by the Indonesian bank.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

448,Stay at Ramada encore was a delight!!,50,April 2019,"We were on our honeymoon and it was a pleasure to stay at Ramada Encore..We stayed there for 6 nights and 5 days for our bali trip and it was worth it!

The room was clean and comfortable. Room lighting was ambient and although I felt it could have more brighter options also to select from.We got a free upgrade to deluxe room!!
The hotel staff are courteous and warming!
The hotel is located little far from Seminyak square or nearby beach, so cab/local conveyance is necessary to reach out to nearest market or tourist areas.

We loved the pool and the dinner time around the pool was so worth the experience!
I would definitely recommended this hotel for good stay at Bali!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
449,Fantastic Friendly Service,50,April 2019,"Thank you Tita, Vita and staff at Ramada Encore for making our stay a dream come true. You were all so friendly to see us any time of the day and go out of your way to help. I will be returning. Excellent and very friendly service by all.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
450,Nice hotel,40,May 2019,"I guess the design of the ""big"" hotel implies a lot of walking to pool, restaurant etc. No close shops so extra beverage and snack purchasing needs to be pre brought some distance from the hotel.
Somewhat out of the way regarding beach proximity etc.but we new that
Working through the myriad of accommodation options was extremely confusing as an example of pool view can be back corner 4th floor looking through a palm grove..
Alas the attraction of 4 pieces of laundry done or a beer is not really a deal maker. Typical ""Balinese logic"". You either love it or just go with the flow.
Quite cool around pool as no sunlight penetration and effects water temperature
which was initially quite chilly.
We chose this hotel for location proximity to friend's house which worked out well for us.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
451,Very happy,50,May 2019,"So happy!! Can’t thank Tita and the staff at Ramada encore Seminyak enough. Honestly the most hospitable, friendly and attentive hotel I’ve stayed at. Would definitely recommend to family and friends. :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The room size is great and clean, and three times I stayed here I've always been upgraded to deluxe room with a pool view. Safety box works (and it is not a small safety box, you can put 3 laptops and 2 cameras inside), amenities are well thought. We have various range of breakfast: from Chinese noodle/vegetables/food, Indonesian buffet, continental breakfast, to Indian breakfast.

454,Honeymoon made special by Ramada,50,April 2019,"Originally we booked a different hotel in Bali however after the first night we realised that hotel was not for us... so my wife and i did a quick search and found Ramada Encore and i tell you this must have been the best decision we made.. the booking was easy we arrived and a very welcoming guest relation officer Tita welcomed us with a smile on her face.. the check in could not have been any easier, she quickly went through our long stay discounts and had our luggages taken to our room.. she then told us that they have given us one of the best rooms in the resort with pool view and great air conditioning, although she was unaware this was our honeymoon after telling her the very next day our bedroom was decorated and we had free welcome drinks which were amazing! in general this is one of the best resorts i have come to, very very clean the restaurant is delicious and the swimming pool very clean and clear, the resort has its own spa which we fully used on a daily bases the prices sooo cheap its unbelievavle they have regular promotion on top which was a bonus.. Tita managed my entire stay including all excursions, a driver and also room service, there is nothing i can fault at this resort it is the best by far in Bali... our honeymoon was made special by these lovely Balinese people so kind loving and caring, its our last day and i kid you not we really do not want to leave.. my speacial thanks goes to everyone at this resort including the room service and house keeping team a very big special thanks to a very kind Tita who did her utmost best to make this special for us we forever thank you and wish you the very best.. this couple will surely miss you and this beatiful resort...!

455,Amazing Holiday,50,April 2019,"Ramada Encore is one of the best hotels that I have stayed at. Everything was exceptional and the staff were amazing. I would advise that if you are staying here that you book a deluxe room that is pool facing so that you can enjoy the beautiful views 24/7 Thank you for a great holiday, hope to return soon!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
456,10/10,50,April 2019,"Ramada Encore is a great hotel that I would definitely recommend. Such beautiful and amazing staff who always helped whenever needed. Especially Tita, she is amazing. Tita helped me organise a special surprise for my sisters room which turned out amazing. I would 100% stay at this hotel again. Thank you Tita",Primera Hotel Seminyak
457,Dont let the bad reviews fool you,50,April 2019,"Like many I had been through various review sites to determine if the Ramada Encore was a good hotel, and unfortunately I had seen a some bad reviews which made me very skeptical. However taking a leap of faith I booked into the Ramada Encore and was blown away by this amazing establishment. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was amazing, not to mention the buffet breakfast was incredible. I am sure you have seen a few reviews that state that uber is not allowed, but that holds true for most places in bali, there is however a free shuttle from the hotel to the Semiyak square at hourly intervals and taxis are so plentiful in Bali that uber is not essential. From a first time traveler the Ramada Encore has set the bar for all other hotels that i will visit in my trips.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
458,Lovely stay but just a few improvements...,40,April 2019,"Stayed for 7 nights at Ramada Encore in the three bedroom family room. The room was spacious and included many complimentary amenities. The pool was great and we enjoyed the option of ordering food by the pool. As we had booked a direct promo deal, we were given coupons for free 6 beers, 4 popcorns and 2 pizzas which we appreciated. We enjoyed dining at the restaurant and the food was always delicious.

However it was disappointing that it was not explained to us upon check in that we were eligible for a 15% discount at the restaurant every time we ate as we would have saved a lot of money especially as we were a group of 6 people and we ate there many times. We even arrived later than the 3pm check in time and were told our room was not ready so we waited and the restaurant was the first thing we tried! Probably better communication of all our benefits would’ve been nice especially as we stayed for a week and felt we weren’t able to fully appreciate staying there with all the hidden benefits that were not explained to us (there were more benefits but could not remember all).

Overall still a lovely stay with special thanks to Kedek, Linda, Bella from the restaurant for accomodating all our food requests, Sepi from the pool who was very friendly and always smiling, Diwa from reception who handled our issues well and professionally, and Tita from guest relations who we were excited to meet after reading so many great reviews about her. She definitely is as kind and cheerful as what everyone has said and always greeted us with a smile. Thanks Ramada Encore, with a few minor improvements I think you could potentially be one of the best hotels we have stayed at.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
459,"Extremely Unhelpful Staff, Poor Location, Average Rooms",20,April 2019,"The hotel is in a poor location on the back streets out of the town centre, you therefore need to get taxis to and from the hotel as it is not safe to walk particularly at night as the streets leading to it are not lit.

On arrival we had a slow check in and were offered a welcome drink. The bar staff were stood with their backs to us on their phones, we repeatedly tried to get their attention and one lady sullenly poured our drinks. It was not the usual happy Balinese welcome at all.

We booked a Superior Double, the room was an average size with a balcony that we didn't have access to, just a window that could be opened a jar. We asked if we could change rooms to have a balcony we could actually walk on and was told it would be 250,000 IDR a night to upgrade. I would expect to be able to use the balcony for the price of the Superior Room.

On arrival I put my suitcase on the floor next to the wall and when I came back to the room my suitcase was crawling in bugs, all my clothes were covered in them. There was a line of small insects crawling along the skirting boards throughout our entire stay. Therefore any food or drinks left on the side would be very quickly covered in bugs.

The fridge was small and not cold so we couldn't keep any drinks cool. We ordered room service on the second night as we had been out on a day trip and were too tired to call a taxi to go out for dinner, if the hotel was in a better location we would have walked to have dinner out somewhere locally. There was no menu in the room, we had to call reception 3 times to ask them to bring us a menu. The food arrived quickly but was poor quality.

Lastly and the main reason I would not recommend this hotel is our checkout was at 12pm and our 20hr flight home was at 10pm. I asked twice at reception if we could extend our room and was told no the hotel was full. I asked if they had a room available for us to shower in before our flight. I was told no we had to shower at the pool but couldn't use soap. I find it appalling that a hotel of this size has no complimentary shower facilities at the end of the stay, this is a pretty basic offering for a hotel. I made it quite clear that this was not acceptable and incredibly poor service and was told if I paid for a spa treatment I could use the shower in the spa afterwards. I had already paid for a spa treatment on my first day of arrival and was told I would need to book another one in order to use the shower at the spa.

After asking to speak to the manager and explaining that it is simply unacceptable to not have access to a shower before a 20hr journey home we were offered to extend our room until 5pm at a cost of 350,000IDR which we were happy to do. Ultimately if they had offered us this when I first asked we would not have found our last day so stressful having to argue with the receptionists repeatedly to have access to a shower.

The pool is nice but there are plenty of beautiful hotels, in better locations with amazing staff so I would 100% recommend booking elsewhere.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
460,Average,40,April 2019,"Stayed for one week on a family room. Room cleaned and replenished everyday. Breakfast is included but there’s no variation in the food i.e. same everyday. Our 15% discount wasn’t explained, so we missed getting our discount on F&B. Overall experience was good and average. Do I want to book with them again? Only if there’s no more available in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
461,Uber driver got beaten by taxi drivers with the help of hotel security.,10,May 2018,"So the security personnel in this hotel seems to be part of balis taxi mafia. I heard this story from other foreign guests in the hotel and read about it some months later, it is a monopoly enforced by force.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
462,Excellent Holiday,40,April 2019,"Just arrived home after visiting The Ramada Encore. Stayed in A 3 bedroom family Suite, it was great. Very spacious and clean and modern furniture. Beds were comfortable and rooms had all amenities and toiletries, especially as we only took hand luggage so was good to know. Pool was huge and provided towels. Not that many sunbeds in the sun as hotel shades the pool but if you head out for the day not an issue.Staff couldnt do enougb for you especially Tita who went above and beyond. Such a great lady. Was great that the hotel had their own cars to use instead of calling a taxi. Always at hand and never had to wait. Only $5 into seminyak. Definatly worth a visit if going out and about.Enjoy!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
463,Great Hospitality,50,April 2019,"Amazing place to stay. Great rooms, really amazing service and hospitality from the staff of Ramada. A special thanks to Tita (Guest Relations) as she made our stay even more memorable and comfortable. She was really helpful in making our trip to Bali unforgettable. She was always there helping get around places and giving us the best offers. Thank you Tita and thank you Ramada !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
464,Amazing,50,April 2019,"This place is great. We had the 3 bedroom apartment and it was fab, it had 1 master suite, a double room and a twin room, we also had an additional bed in the master suite for the little one but we didn’t need it. It had a living area and kitchen area with fridge and microwave. All the staff were amazing, especially Tita from Guest Relations, this lady can not do enough for you and she is an absolute credit to Ramada Encore.... to be honest all the staff were great. It was my partners 40th birthday when we arrived and they had dressed the room up with petals and gave him a birthday cake.

The hotel is about a 5-10 minute taxi ride in to Seminyak and about 10-15 mins in to Kuta and we never had any problem getting a taxi each day.

Overall we would definitely recommend this hotel and would consider staying at the Ramada Encore again for our next Bali trip.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Great hotel with great pool and food. Little disappointed they no longer have night time entertainment. The staff are the main reason this place is a great place to stay.

Thanks for making our stay so enjoyable",Primera Hotel Seminyak
472,I will explain why I have a poor rating,10,April 2019,"1) the staff are all obsessed with speaking about money, payments, deposits, collections all the time. And when one ask them why, their answer is “it is because of policy”. In my opinion there must be more finesse when speaking about money . In Ramada Encore Seminyak it becomes very vulgar. In Bahasa Indonesia the word is “Kasar”. No amount of excuse can explain away the perception of vulgarity. The staff would even collect the bill for a breakfast even before I had a chance to finish my breakfast and I did not ask for the bill. I have stayed in Ramada all over the world and have never encountered this perception. I am sure this is not in the policy of Ramada International to perpetuate this vulgarity. Ramada Encore Semingak is a franchise but I believe that where it ends, just paying for the use of the brand. The owner of Ramada Encore Seminyak as I understood is an Indonesian Chinese from Bandung and he does ran his property like a very mom and pop operation - there is nothing international about it. 2) this is the perhaps one of a very few hotel property in Bali that has ban “GOJEK” and “Grab” . This is extremely hard for guest who may prefer to use such services. This is discriminatory and anti competition and must not be condone. The management must immediately lift the ban.
The only saving grace for the owners is that all the staff are such polite and nice people. They do try very hard and I admire them.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The hotel breakfast was amazing, the biggest variety I’ve ever seen, whilst also being delicious! The restaurant was very well priced with another huge variety of dishes, all so tasty. We ate here most nights. We tested out the spa with a traditional Balinese massage, it was so relaxing so we had another before we left! However, the best part of the hotel by far were the staff.

494,Bali Beauty,50,March 2019,"Ramada Encore A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.

Welcoming staff on arrival set the tone for the our stay at Ramada. Gorgeous decor with soft Balinese music filtering through the reception area.

Our Room...FANTASTIC!! We were upgrade to a Balcony Room on the 2nd Floor overlooking the Pool with a Super King Bed. I needed a mega phone to yell out goodnight to my husband haha Outdoor Lounger which was great for unwinding at the end of the day and being a creature of habit I always make my bed in the morning but every morning without fail the staff came in and remade it...they were outstanding.

Food was absolutely divine especially the Breakfast. If you couldn't find something at the outstanding Buffet to wet your appetite then chances are good nothing is going to please you. They had an Egg Station any which way you wanted, Asian Cuisine, Indian, Balinese, European, assortment of Cereals, Breads, Croissants, Fresh Fruit, Salads (yes! Salad for brekkie hahaha) Juices and my favorite, the Crepe, Pancake & Waffle Station.

Having a Restaurant in the Hotel was a bonus. We ate a majority of our dinners there and found it to be very reasonably priced (didn't need lunch because breakfast was so filling)

The SPA...Highly recommend the Foot Reflexology, got to keep those feet happy for all the walking they do at the Markets while your Bartering :-)

Swimming Pool was another A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. feature at Ramada Encore. My only tiny winy thing I would say is PLEASE don't allow guest to drink in the Pool. If the Glass was to smash that would close the Pool down until it was guaranteed all the glass was picked up and it's also not a good look for the children to see.

On the evening that we left for home the Senior Guest Relations Officer (same person who organised the motor bikes for us) gifted both my niece and I with beautiful sarongs, a reminder of our time with these lovely people.

Nothing was a problem at Ramada Encore. I would certainly highly recommend it and come back time and time again :-)

We have a saying back home in NZ:

He Tangata He Tangata He Tangata. Roughly translated it means.
'What is the most important thing in the world, it is The People, The People, The People.

Such gently spoken people who were always happy to make our visit a wonderful experience so be gentle back and be KIND...it's free PEACE!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
495,Can’t recommend this hotel enough!,50,March 2019,"After being home only a week I can’t wait to return, this place is a hidden gem and an excellent place to stay. The front of house staff are so welcoming and there’s nothing they can’t do for you.
The ladies in the spa are also fantastic and so friendly. Both my partner and I had numerous treatments including the facial and the 90 minute full body Balinese massage, we felt so relaxed afterwards and couldn’t believe how reasonably priced they were.
The hotel itself was modern and clean with an amazing pool and restaurant area. The overall cleanliness was 10/10 and the food fantastic. The restaurant and bar staff were again so attentive, courteous and made us feel very welcome at all times.
Tita, from Guest Services went above and beyond in helping me organise a birthday surprise for my partner on our arrival and looked after us throughout our stay!!
I really can’t fault this hotel or any of its staff, not once did we pass a member of staff without them saying hello or asking us how our day had been or what we had planned and because of this they made us feel at home! I honestly can’t recommend this hotel enough!!

Drinks were reasonable as well. We needed some relaxing time and this hotel had it. The staff were some of the nicest people we had met, and looked after us really well. 3 of us had some treatments in the Spa area, and again this was really good value with excellent treatments. Not too much to visit in the immediate area, but there was a free shuttle from hotel to a couple of nearby beaches, and taxis were cheap.

505,Enjoyable stay at Ramada Encore,50,March 2019,I stayed in Seminyak for 3 nights at Ramada Encore. The hotel was centrally located with only 5 min ride from the busy streets of Seminyak. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and the place was very clean and comfortable.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
506,On your own,30,March 2019,The hotel and staff is good but the location is away from the beach and all other restaurants we upgraded for very little money to a much better hotel room with a balcony beside the pool which is located at the centre of the hotel there is a good choice of breakfast served just in front of the swimming pool the problem is the hotel location,Primera Hotel Seminyak

We will miss this place...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
509,Just fine hotel,30,February 2019,"Arrived here almost 11 pm, I think only 2 or 3 guests checking in include my group of 6 people but check in took more than 30min. Rather disappointed as we're already tired. No staff offered to help our luggages. Room was just ok, looked rather old, maybe need renovation. Hotel is far from beach, restaurants and shops. Wifi is fast. Breakfast is quite good, many choices. What I like most is the pool, it's lovely.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
510,I would choose other hotel,30,March 2019,"After reading reviews I was looking forward to our stay. The staff are very friendly,the food nice. However the hotel is not soundproof whatsoever, so I couldn't sleep, as they kept playing music from downstairs area,which is not very thoughtful as there are people who have early tours or had a tiring day, and I could hear neighbours upstairs as the ceilings are paper thin. Also expect extra charges incurred for things like towels with visible dirt. The location is only ok, 40min walking distance to the beach. So next time I would stay elsewhere.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
511,The best hotel in bali,50,March 2019,"I superliked the hotel and the amenities. The hotel has upgraded my stay to higher category room as complimentary. The room was bigger n very clean with all necessary things equipped. They have surprised me with welcome cake in the room.
The breakfast was also good n sufficient for me as I m vegan so slightly less options available.
The hotel has its own massage n spa center. I have taken their traditional balinese massage n that was a great experience n very relaxing. Overall I will rate it 5/5 for my perfect stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
512,"A Great Place To Stay, From Alan Lilburne",50,March 2019,I had a fantastic stay. Staff always happy to greet you and have a sweet and caring attitude which transfer to the vibe of the place. Great food and drinks. Room was clean. The large pool area is so relaxing and beautiful. Food and drinks can be brought to your sun lounge lounge at a push of a button. Great value for money. Do your yourself a favour and stay here.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
513,"Ramada Encore Bali, Seminyak",50,March 2019,"Stayed here for 4 Nights and must say that they offer best value for every penny one spends.

Although 4star hotel, but amenities they offer to guests are near 5star category.

Above all staff at the hotel is very friendly and helpful. Always greet us with big smile and eager to help us at all the time.

Location is not on the beach but is not too far away from beach as well.

Food they offer is excellent.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
514,"Book this hotel, highly recommended",50,March 2019,"I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and the day spa is simply one of the best in the world and at very affordable prices. Service at the hotel is also possibly the best we have ever experienced, I would rate it 6 star. 15% discount voucher attached, no I’m not on a commission 🙂 but if you want a relaxing stay in Bali, this is the place for you!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
515,Wonderful Experience - Nice Guest Management,50,March 2019,"The Service in Ramada Encore is very good and the staff is very polite and always ready to serve.

Rooms and Bathroom are clean.

Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner are awesome. They have good variety of Veg and Non-Veg items. The perfect destination for Indian who eat non-veg on few days and veg on few days.

Swimming pool is good and I really enjoyed my time in pool during night.

Also the cab services provided by Hotel is very good. The drivers have knowledge and they can speak english. I want to appreciate Nyoman and Wayian for acting as our driver and tour during our journey in Bali. They are very good and we learnt half of Balinese culture from them.

In case you have any issue you can ask them and they will resolve the issue within minutes.

Special thanks to Vita, you made our stay and wedding anniversary memorable.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
516,Find other hotel,30,December 2018,"Booked this hotel during new year eve, but I didn't enjoy it for one bit.
The check in process is taking too long, we had to wait for around 1 hour. The price is too high for the room they are selling. I paid for deluxe double room it was around IDR 900+ And the room is too small. You can definitely feel how stuffy it is upon entering. The toilet is very basic. It is not soundproof and late at night there was couple fight from across the hall and we can hear it clearly. The location is too far from the main road, taxi driver hardly recognize it. And if you're planning to book online taxi from application, please think twice because they prohibited it. Instead, they will sell you the taxi which is way more expensive than online taxi.
The food is average, the place is too crowded. There are more better choice for this price range, really.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
517,Amazing Service - Thank you Vita,50,March 2019,"Vita made my experience with this hotel exceptional, her high attention to details and communication are fantastic. She went above and beyond to make all the arrangements I needed. Highly recommend you contact her on your next stay.

519,Amazing service!,50,March 2019,"What a fantastic trip we had to The Ramada Encore.
The service here was just amazing - right from the moment I booked online I dealt with Tita and she was just wonderful to deal with. So helpful over email & helped me to organise special decorations in the room for my boyfriends birthday. Once arrived she greeted me with a big smile & a big hug - she was just lovely! She helped us with everything throughout our stay & couldn’t be happier with ALL the service from ALL the staff! Would highly recommend. Great clean rooms, massive pool & lovely food - would go back for sure!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
520,Very Disappointing!!,20,September 2018,"We booked this hotel only for few nights when in Bali (thank god at least could enjoy rest of the trip staying in other hotel). Check in was a disaster!!! We reached here after a 10 - 12 hours of journey with infant expecting some immediate rest for a kid. However THEY MADE US WAIT FOR 3 HOURS IN THE LOBBY!!!! By this time we were so frustrated with the service. Rooms are very small and bad in shape. Also staff is so rude when we asked receptionist about delay in check in she refused to answer and was busy on her hone all the time.

WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME, MOOD SPOILER, WORST HOSPITALITY!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
521,The staff really let this place down,20,March 2019,"Our stay started off so well here. Nice upgrade to big room, super comfy bed and everything clean and well maintained. Things started going wrong when my partner had a drink around the pool.

He didn’t have cash on him but asked for the drink to be put on our bill. Apparently that can’t be done and we needed to pay immediately. My husband said he would go and get some cash and come back to pay - the staff member said “I will follow you to your room to make sure you pay”. Really? For a £2 lime and soda water?! Very rude.

Our stay also fell on Nyepi - we got a leaflet listing everything we couldn’t do on the day (mostly no noise, no internet, no leaving the hotel, no light etc) We were horrified to find the hotel turn in to a nursery for local children with them running around and screaming bloody murder. Disgusting considering the rules the tourists had to abide by and the staff did nothing.

Food was a whole other ball game. They charge you almost DOUBLE the already extortionate prices on Nyepi - even though you have no other option but to eat there. They had no vegetarian options and so we were told the only food we could eat was fruit! We complained to the manager who told us the kitchen would make us whatever we would like and bring it to our room free of charge. Well, what a pallava that was! They tried to charge us for the food which was wrong as they tried to give us fish even though we’d already specified no meat. Then when they got the order right they again tried to charged us double the price it should have been. We had to sit in our room with the room service assistant whilst he tried to call his manager for verification. Very embarrassing.

The hotel really does not trust its guests and makes you feel as though you are going to steal their cheap furnishings or towels - it’s like trying to get a pool towel out of Fort Knox it’s such a process. And then to be chased around the hotel for £2 payment for a drink! Terrible.

The staff are robotic and there’s no sincerity with their actions or their welcomes. Even after we had complained to management on 3 seperate occasions and told them we were on our honeymoon they didn’t do anything to rectify the problem or make our stay better.They really don’t care about their customers only about money. Don’t stay here. There’s much better places in Seminyak that are closer to the restaurants and shops.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
522,*Baliness Ruined in Ramada*,30,March 2019,"After Staying in Grand Hyatt and Hyatt Regency Bali we destroyed the last moment of Baliness. We have waited for Room to be ready and the room was OK with dried flower decoration . Later the food was not at all possible to the good mark. For pool towels we have to deposit the key and then they will issue the Towels, sounds like someone will steal there cheap stuff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
523,A honeymoon disaster,10,March 2019,"Would give it 0 stars of possible!

The hotel itself is a nice setting and the pool is lovely. However that is as far as it goes.

As part of our 3 month honeymoon we have stayed in some nice places as well as some cheap and nasty hostels and this place is by far the worst. Our first complaint was when we spent a day by the pool and ordered a soda water equivalent to £1.25. After receiving the drink by the pool I was asked to pay. I requested that the order be put on the room bill but I was told I havent put a deposit down at reception and so had to pay now (we was not informed that we needed to do this during check in). I told them I didn't have cash on me as I had spent my last bit earlier in the morning and therefore needed to go to an atm, the staff member said that's fine he will follow me to the room with the bill (what!?!?) I told him not to as I don't have cash in my room either, 5 minutes after going to our room he then rang to tell me to pay! I think they genuinely thought I was there to rob them of can of soda!

Our next problem we found was that we were booked to stay here over Nyepi day which means that we were not allowed to leave the hotel as the island forbids it. We thought this might be a nice relaxing experience however we were far from wrong! The hotel let's most of its rooms to local families which results in a mass kids club descending on the hotel. The pool is full of children with inflatables, screaming and shouting, not the most relaxing experience especially on SILENCE DAY!

We decided to go have breakfast at 10:15 knowing that it finished at 10:30. We didn't opt for the breakfast option with the room so we were more than happy to pay for this day. We were told by the staff that we were not allowed to eat as breakfast had finished, even though other people were still eating. We went to our room to try and order room service but were told that we cannot as it doesn't start until 21:30! But they said we could get lunch downstairs from 11. We went down at 11:15 and were then told that lunch is not served until 12...... when we enquired what they would be serving for lunch as we were both vegan, we got told we could only have fruit! This resulted in another trip to see the manager, she apologised and said she would look into it for us and get back to us. Eventually the restaurant manager rang our room and apologised and asked us what we would like, we told him that the day previous we had a nice lunch of noodles with veg and tofu, nice and simple and tasty. He also said to get the quattro potatoes so we said yes. As a gesture they said they will bring it to our room which we were not expecting but were much more appreciative of as we didnt particularly want to eat lunch with screaming kids everywhere.

The food eventually arrived straight away were greeted with egg noodles without tofu and instead topped with prawn crackers (clearly they didn't understand the no egg or fish request). We told the waiter this is not what we wanted and he should take it away and get the manager to ring our room to discuss. 5 min later the door knocks, this time a different waiter holding a tray of food....the exact same plates we sent away. I sent him away and told him I will ring down. I explained to the manager on the phone what the problem is, he apologised and asked me to confirm what it is I wanted AGAIN! he said he will not charge us either which was kind. The food then eventually came up correctly however it arrived with a bill over 400k! I enquired firstly why so much and secondly that it was meant to be free of charge for the inconvenience. They stated that the menu is different for Nyepi day, it transpires that the food is the exact same as other days however a smaller selection but with a higher cost attached (typically 20k extra per item!). The waiter then stood in our room for 15 min whilst on the phone and radio to the manager who eventually agreed it was free and he would come and see us (after I demanded that he come to the room if he wants me to pay for this dreadful experience of ordering food). He never did come to the room and as such I did not pay for the meal.

I am not usually one to complain but feel that in the 3 months and numerous places we have stayed this has severely ruined our honeymoon experience in Seminyak. The fact that they charge a premium on Nyepi for food knowing that the guests cannot leave the property shows the greed of the hotel owners and the lack of customer care! Whilst most of the staff do seem friendly it's almost robotic like and doesn't actually feel genuine, as they sometimes cannot even look at you whilst saying thank you or hello.

The hotel is ok for maybe one night but if you value customer service and sincerity then maybe look elsewhere. This was definitely NOT a 4 star experience.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
524,hi all just got home to Australia,50,March 2019,well were do I start the room was great and clean the food was great but the best part was the friendly staff they all were so wonderful they made us feel like family very warm and beaming smiles big shout out for our barman EKA and two beautiful ladies LINDA and TIES AND ALL THE FRONT DESK you all deserve a pay bonus cheers from Chris and MARTINA .,Primera Hotel Seminyak

This hotel is really value for money. We will definitely be back in the future.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
527,budget hotel disguised as 5-star,10,March 2019,"Right from locating the hotel to check-in into the hotel to the check out, the whole experience was poor.

arrived at 12:30, despite being confirmed early check-in, I got the room 1 hour later than the regular check in time. Got into the room at 4. Just before getting the keys, they realized that I am an Indian hence then should also take some security deposit which we were not informed about before on the website or while doing the formalities.

Staff is inexperienced, not at par with standard with other good hotel chains. Front office/ reception is under staffed, just 2 people handling 200+ room hotel with rooms the size of match box.

Breakfast was mediocre, tea coffee was never hotel during the entire 3 day duration. What's even worse is that they have a paid tea coffee counter next to a dysfunctional free tea coffee machine. Every-time you go to a hotel staff for any help, they will delegate the work back to you saying it is self service. Could not even eat a satisfying breakfast even once.

It is less a hotel and more a College hostel with a list of fines for breaking rules starting from Smoking to losing towels to losing keys/ cards etc etc.

I asked for a room with is one level up from the basic room and it was small as a match box with 2 single beds in lieu of 2 queen beds which was committed on the website.

Location, although in the center but is still a little secluded and isn't safe at night for anyone who is a foreigner in Bali with posters telling you to be aware of Chain/ Bag/ Mobile snatchers. Last mile of narrow roads leading to the hotel are pitch dark with no street lighting.

Finally I was shocked to see multiple electricity wires running under a small bridge that they have made right above the swimming pool, it is like disaster in waiting.

Do not wish to go back again and if any one of you are planning too, then you can definitely do better.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
528,Awesome ambience and hospitality,50,March 2019,"The Superior room was excellent. Breakfast had multiple options and also included Indian vegetarian food. The cafe and bar was by the Lagoon pool which provided an excellent view while eating. The staff always greet you and are very helpful.
The hotel also helped me to plan a one day trip with driver at a good price.
Must visit in March as less crowded.
Only the airport transfers from and to hotel was a bit expensive (200k IDR).

531,Comfortable stay,40,March 2019,"I was sold on this hotel, from the moment I saw the pictures of the pool. On top of that, the price was really affordable especially since I traveled solo.I certainly have no complaints about the room as it was spacious and comfortable. Besides that, the pool was accessible from my room. So I was really happy about that. The pillows were soft and made it harder to wake up in the morning. The staff was helpful and friendly too.

554,Bang for your bucks!!!,50,November 2018,"We read some mixed reviews about this hotel but found them all to be unwarranted as we had the best time and were treated so well by everyone working at the hotel.
We booked multiple pool access rooms as a large group and all of our rooms were together as requested. The rooms themselves were large, clean, comfortable and modern.
The hotel grounds were kept nice and clean but the best part was the pool, it's a lot bigger than pictures suggest and a good depth but also nice and clean, the staff also offer free snacks around the pool for everyone to promote their menu, who doesn't love something for free!
The gym was great with modern equipment but you need to get in early as it gets busy and the food was fantastic. They have a huge range at breakfast to accomodate everyones needs and have a noodle bar with the egg station where everything his made up fresh in front of you.
The massage at the spa was also great but the staff were the best, anything we asked for they had no problem helping and that was helping out with a large group of people and some elderly and nothing at all was a problem.
The location is on the outer reaches of Seminyak so to go into Kuta or to Seminyak Square it is a short Taxi ride or they have the free shuttle bus but this must be why the price is very reasonable and a cheaper rate but considering what you get for what you are paying for at this hotel its worth it.
We are retiring in September and can't wait!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
555,"Young, enthusiastic staff",50,February 2019,"Location is a little out of way of the hustle and bustle therefore quiet. The highlight for me was the friendly staff who couldn’t do enough for you, they are young, kind and their hosting skills are to a high standard. Breakfast is fabulous, ever type of diet catered for.

561,Best staff ever!,50,February 2019,"This hotel is exceptional! Room is modern and clean, bed and pillows super comfortable, food is yummy and facilities are great! What can beat that? The best staff ever! Not one or two - but literally the entire hotel has the best staff I have seen - I cannot praise them highly enough! I had fallen ill staying at a similiar priced hotel in the heart of Seminyak and transferred to this hotel as I was worried about my health, cleanliness and staff at other hotel also weren't great. From the second I got there I knew I had made a good choice. They upgraded my room and let me go there early and then came to check on me to make sure I was okay. After a visit by the Dr, the super kind, professional and charming Agus took me to the hospital and stayed with me and helped with paperwork and insurance, and didn't leave till I was safely in the Ward. Thank you to Tita (whose smile lights up the room), Dian and Vita (both so sweet and thoughtful) for visiting me in the hospital. Lastly to the best 2 bellboys on the planet - supercool Angga who is just thoughtful and friendly, and super sweet Budi who entertained me all the way back to the airport! From the bottom of my heart - all my thanks to the best staff ever - and I will see you next time I come to Bali! :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
562,Nice Hotel,50,February 2019,"We loved our stay, best hotel we’ve stayed in while in Bali. The room, pool and food were fantastic but special thanks for Dian, Tya and all staff were the absolute stand out - friendly, accommodating and organised. We would stay again in a heartbeat",Primera Hotel Seminyak
563,Brilliant staff,40,January 2019,Vita and the team were amazingNothing was to much trouble and they were so friendly.From the time we arrived they went out of their way for us and we ended up upgrading to the pool access room.Thankyou Vita and the whole team,Primera Hotel Seminyak
564,Excellent place ... Amazing stay at Ramada bali,40,January 2019,"The hotel is really well with restaurant/bar near pool area,
The Staff is Incredible. Especially staff tita who made our stay pleasant and memorable. Loved every bit & TITA, a staff member turned a very good friend. Overall experience excellent can recommend to everyone.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
565,Memorable stay,50,January 2019,"The hotel is a beautiful property about a 10 minute car ride from Seminyak Square. On arriving we were informed that our room has been upgraded. It was a pool access room. Loved the pool and food. The prawn laksa here is the best in Bali. We stayed here for 2 days and then was travelling to Lombok island. Tita at the guest relations is the person you need to contact if in Bali. She was so helpful and patient with us, she actually helped us in planning our trips in Bali and even checked on us when we were in the middle of heavy rain in Lombok. The staff here is extremely warm and welcoming. Wish we stayed here longer because it’s simply one of the good hotels. Will definitely be back!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
566,Daughters 21st,10,January 2019,"4th time to Bali and the worst hotel so far, yet it’s rated 4 stars. Writing this while locked in my bathroom as the
door handle has fallen off! Now there knocking on my door asking to be let in!! I’m locked in the bathroom you fool! Had to ring them in the bathroom from my mobile.

As pleasant as they try to be unfortunately they are only attentive when it comes time to pay your bill. Also don’t take your bathroom towel out as they count every single thing that’s in your room. You lose it you pay! They clean the bed every day but don’t top up the shampoo or shower gel and don’t replace the towel unless you ask!

Overall wish we had stayed in Kuta where we normally stay. This is nice for a family and if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta but we’re an outgoing family so it didn’t suit us.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
567,Loved it!,40,January 2019,"Ah! Bali has my heart now.Loved our stay here,neat rooms & very very friendly staff. Best part was pool side rooms and access to it anytime a day,their bus shuttle service thoughout a day was a perfect thing, 24 hours room service & ofcourse Tita without whom we couldnt check Nusa Penida from our bucketlist so smooth, Very helpful, very patient & a fantastic lady!
What else would you want in such a great price.. just a lil more travel to kuta & semniyak beach n market if you are on your own .Ramada encore Seminyak had me at Vast breakfast menu with indian section as well !! That too you can enjoy by the pool..

But a bit disappointed with the room service guy entering & cleaning your room without your permission specially when we’re down for breakfast.
Anyway Not all things has to be perfect ... i will come back soon :)

Thanx for a wonderful experience😇",Primera Hotel Seminyak
568,Excellent place for a beautiful vacation,50,January 2019,Excellent place to stay at excellent location. Awesome cooperating staff with very friendly nature. The best part was tita who made my trip so comfortable and was available 24*7 for help without her this trip would not have been so pleasant.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
569,Good value for money,50,January 2019,"Kind friendly and helpful stuffGood breakfast, nice swimming poolI am glad we paid extra to have access to the pool from our room - was well worth it!The hotel located a bit out of walking range from the shops and restaurants but the is a shuttle drop off that goes several times a day and taxies are very cheap (2-3 dollars a ride), so didn't worry usMy daughters and I had a great time",Primera Hotel Seminyak
570,Surprising!!,40,December 2018,"Was pleasantly surprised! Check-in was effortless, rooms comfortable, and clean enough, (by bali budget hotel standards) ...is it 4 stars as it would be anywhere else in the world...of course not...is there mould in the bathrooms...of course...look at what u r paying...but the hotel design works really well with restaurant/bar near pool area, with a pool table which is free, and plenty of friendly staff around to get u whatever you may need.
Cheap AU$10 breakfast was more than adequate...with decent bacon and a bit of variety each day....eg crepes one day, pancakes next then waffles day after! We ate a lot of pool snacks and dinners and no-one got sick.
Beds comfortable, airconditioning worked really well. Comfortable reception areas for people to lounge or have some time out. Wifi average...better strength in the rooms than at the pool. 2 small water bottles per day. Short walk to a small shop.
People complain about the remoteness..but seriously u could pay AU$5 for the hotel car to drop you in Seminyak...or wait 10 min for a bluebird taxi to arrive and pay AU$1.50 - $3...it was not an issue!? In addition the Spa on the 5th floor was well priced with good massage. A great budget family friendly hotel for both the very young and teens option...just dont expect the Ritz...it is a budget hotel in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

To recount an instance, I left one of my favourite dresses here and was in touch with them after around 3 months of travel. They were very courteous even offered to courier it to me. Loved every bit.

The disappointment when we were unable to upgrade was accepted but really if not for your wonderful staff dealing with us we would be even unhappier. the cupboards creak, the beds are soft, the bathroom does not have non slip tiles in the shower. Should you use up your loo roll you are in trouble because you need to ask reception for an additional one....",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The respectable staff and the customer service offered makes our return certain.
Thank you Remada Encore for an excellent experience.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
587,Excellent hotel,50,December 2018,We have stayed at this hotel 4 times and love it. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfy. The breakfast is great and the pool is beautiful. Will definitely be back in the future,Primera Hotel Seminyak
588,Great place great staff,50,December 2018,"Really brilliant place, I was there for 4 days at the end of a long break. Great rooms, pool area, bar etc and the main thing is the staff, they are so genuinely friendly not just because it's there job and they do credit to the hotel. Recommended.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
589,Pay for the name,30,January 2019,"Pretty pricey for quality of rooms and facilities. You’re paying to stay at a Ramada. Rooms are very noisy unless on top floors as movement in rooms above can be heard until early hours. Some guests also very loud on balconies at night. Informed reception and were moved, but didn’t help totally as were still on middle floor.
Breakfast selection is buffet and while plenty on choice, bear in mind it is sat around for a while, both partner and myself were sick after eating breakfast, since we’d had nothing else the previous evening, seems most likely.

Hotel doesn’t allow Uber’s or grabs so you have to get dropped off down the road, and it’s a good 40 minutes walk along busy roads to get to central seminyak.

Plus side, pool lovely (although if you don’t like noisy splashy families and kids, not so relaxing) staff wonderful and polite, but room cleaning a bit lacklustre.

In summary, if you’d prefer to stick with a chain because you trust the name, I’d think twice and make sure there really aren’t any other better options!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
590,"Nice hotel, but poor location and not the best services",30,December 2018,"The hotel is beautiful, staff are lovely and the rooms are clean. Howevever the rooms get very very stuffy and you need to turn the A/C on after a short while, but then the A/C was quite intense and would give us a dry mouth and nose by the next morning if left on overnight. We woke up several times during the night because of this so didn't have a good sleep. We could also hear the elevator 'ding' through our room door and it was frustrating especially during the night.

The services were quite poor considering this is a 4-star hotel - Only one towel per person was given as the hotel was at 'max capacity' so we could only exchange our dirty towels for new ones, and weren't given any additional towels. Sometimes housekeeping wouldn't come to exchange the towels and you would need to call them again. There were NO face towels either - the hotel doesn't offer them.

The hotel is very poorly located, with virtually nothing within walking distance. The shuttle services to Seminyak square ran a few times per day, however they would get booked out in advance as only 5-6 people could fit per trip. There was no pickup service, only a drop off service. You were able to order a taxi service to the hotel, and sometimes there was a bit ofg a wait while other times it was quick.

The buffet breakfast was good, but the lunch services and room services weren't great and quite stingy in portion sizes considering higher-than-average pricing compared to other Bali hotels. I guess they take advantage of the fact that there are no local cafes.

The pool area was great, with one side that is family/kid friendly and the other side mainly for adults. The pool chairs are in the water so it's really nice to step out straight into the pool (shallow end). You need to obtain a 'towel card' from reception in order to get a towel from the pool area, which you then get back upon returning the towel.

Overall the hotel wasn't great due to location, food options and lack of towels. However it seems like a nice family-stay type of hotel if you just want to enjoy the pool with kids and are happy with the food.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
591,Worth stay at Ramada,40,December 2018,"Ramada is one of the best hotel that you can think of in seminayak.. far from hustle bustle , awesome ambience with comparatively low price than other 4 star hotels. We got 2 pool access rooms. We just loved it... bar section , water pool everything makes a perfect ambience with low music playing all the time.

Apart from the hotel, ramada was awesome experience because of helpful staff as well. Tita made our experience wonderful there. She helped us in framing our whole plan of Bali. Helped us in arranging cab when required. Best part even after checking out she was helping us which rarely someone does. She was really very helpful and made us realise that for remaining days also we should have been in Ramada. Thanks Tita !

I will definately recommend Ramada to the ones who are looking for low price and gud Hotel. Been to other expensive and 4star hotels in bali , I would say ramada was one of the best hotel in Bali. If at all you are planning to go to Bali, consider Ramada.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Though it is a 1.5KM from main market area, but hotel always arrange blue bird taxi at a very nominal price of $2. This property is away from main market, that's why it is a perfect paradise for vacation/leisure/relax. Breakfast is amazing as they have wide range of options, beautiful restaurant on poolside which make it more elegant. All staff are super friendly, they all make our stay memorable. Would definitely like to visit again there.

Tita (Guest relationship manager) has been super helpful in making our trip memorable. Keep doing the good work",Primera Hotel Seminyak

596,Ryan family first trip to Bali 2018,50,December 2018,"Highly recommend The Ramada Encore in Seminyak. We have just had our first trip to Bali over Xmas and stayed here 2 Adults and 3 Teenagers 17-19 boys/girls. The family Room was spacious and a gorgeous view of the pool with full amenties water cooler, fridge, microwave, stove and two bathrooms. The service of the staff from the front reception, meal service, bar attendents, housekeeing and concierge were fabulous, always willing to help and genuine friendly smiley staff. The breakfast we got inclusive and has a huge choice of full hot and cold breakfast and sweets ( a great way to start the day) suggest get this. The in house Day spa amazing we would spoil ourselves now and then and pay the $25 for 90 min massage however well worth it. Plenty of others close by also for $7. The pool is Amazing and great to sit around and enjoy cocktails or a Bintang. To get into Seminyak or Legian by Bluebird Taksi cost anywhere from $2 to $4. We actually walked to Seminyak one day taking 30 min stroll. The food for lunch and dinner also enjoyable and reasonably priced from pizzas, ribs, satays, nasi goreng and much more. Highly recommend Ramada Encore for a short or Long staycation for couples and families. The weather for us at Xmas time was good only 1 rainy day but was welcomed as we walked the shops/markets. Very competitive prices and always offering great deals we will definitely be going back.
THANKYOU RAMADA ENCORE SEMINYAK.

603,Lovely place very tidy,40,December 2018,"A lovely place to stay definitely value for money. The staff are first class they are always cleaning and smiling and saying hello. I had an issue with my air conditioner so i got upgraded and moved within 3 hours. The lady that sorted that out for me was very professional and her follow up was unreal. Also Eka Bar was a bartender serving me during my visit he was first class. Ekas knowledge of the cocktails was great and his conversation was interesting and funny. I really enjoyed the quality of the taxi service the hotel provides its cheap and reliable and quality cars and good young sociable drivers. One issue i have is the smoking in the dining area while people are eating tea. I understand the laws in Australia are different than they are in bali but we are not living in the stone ages here. Would you dip your steak in a ashtray then eat it well thats what you're expecting people to do when they are eating and get a face full of second hand smoke. As well the fact ive had a heart bypass 2 years ago and do not smoke myself and havnt for 14 years. Smoking areas should be for just that you shouldnt have to sit next to someone smoking because thats the area where meals are served. And what about the kids around these people smoking we have an obligation to them aswell. After i spoke to management im sure things will be taken into account regarding other people's health when having smoking and eating areas the same place. In all i loved the hotel the location the staff it was all awesome ive stayed in a few hotels around bali Hard rock, Aryaduta, Peninsula and this id value for money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

610,Simply Remarkable,50,October 2018,"Its a bit late to write this review as we were staying there at the end of october. Me and my wife was staying there for a couple of days before we return to Vancouver from our east asian trip! There was nothing we could complaint as the service was beyond one could expect. The check in was smooth, huge pool, spacious room. It was a short stay but we got such a lovely treatment from the staff Miss Ties who helped me to arrange a surprise for my wife! We hope we could come back here one day",Primera Hotel Seminyak
611,Very good hotel for the money,50,November 2018,"I stayed in Encore hotel Seminyak for 12 days and was really happy about my choise.Pool was big and clean, breakfast excellent for around 6 dollar, staff was very friendly and helpfull, especially I have to give a big thanks to guest relation manager Vita who was very helpfull in all maters.Hotel is located in a quiet area aprox 10 min. on scooter from Seminyak center and the Beach which for me was perfect.If im back in Seminyak I will choose this hotel Again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
612,Hotel Receptionist were not helpfull and not courteous,10,December 2018,"We booked 14rooms through 3 different travel agents. 5 roooms reserved through Hotelbeds was non payment according to the receptionist (Mr Dewa). We were asked to pay upfront for those 5 rooms with nonexception since its hotel policy. Eventhough we asked to hold/open with our credit card to guarantee payment until checkout, it was still unacceptable to him. I was still required to settle bills when check in as if like he didnt believe in me or my credit cards??? So not courteous and helpfull at all. Note to hotel: Please do not blame hotel guest if travel agent failed to make payment to hotel, since guest were in trouble too since they have to ask for refund from travel agent. Really need to improve treatments/behaviour if encounter same issue again in the future.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
613,"Great place, exceptional pool and staff",50,December 2018,"Loved it here, great accommodation, great food. Staff were second to none, all at pool bar was great! Breakfast by the pool was perfect, not right on the centre of town, but only short trip to the seminyak square. Will be back here for sure!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Firrsly i’m check in my name not in the listed so i waiting another hour, then i got room in tne corner and underbrush view. Hotel far away from everywhere and quite difficult to get transoprtation except from hotel and taxi",Primera Hotel Seminyak

617,A perfect place to stay for your getaway trip in Bali,50,December 2018,"We stayed here for 2 nights and the experience was top notch! The room is clean, the aircon is so cool, a perfect way to cool yourself down after a hot weather day outside while chilling out on the cozy couch while watching your favourite tv channels from all over the globe. For those looking for a WiFi connection, you can rely on the internet connection here inside your room for sure. But the best is.. the room size, very decent for a 4 star hotel. We'll definitely be back!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
618,Perfect adress in Seminyak,50,December 2018,"We often come to Bali for our work .... and we always stay in Ramada Encore Seminyak. Good location even if you need transport, quiet, classic but tasty decoration, beautiful pool, clean & confortable rooms, kind services. All is perfect in this category",Primera Hotel Seminyak
619,Best hotel!,50,November 2018,"Stayed with my family for 9 nights in a family suite, in November/December, and the facilities were nothing short of amazing. The beds were comfortable, the bar was open late, room service was prompt, housekeeping were very thorough, and staff were very friendly and accommodating. The waffle station in the mornings were a massive hit with our group.

A little out of the way of the main strip, but nothing reception couldn’t fix when they called Bluebird cabs for us.

When I come back to Bali with my partner, we will be spending time at this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
620,Noel,50,December 2018,This hotel is a bit out of the way but has a shuttle service to Seminyak and Kuta. A $3-4 taxi fare will take you most places. The rooms are large and the beds comfortable. We had a poolside access room which opened out onto a path to the breakfast/ dining room and of course the magnificent pool. The pool is kid friendly and extends for the internal length of the hotel. The staff were so cooperative and friendly. This is an excellent hotel for families and couples.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
621,Ramada Encore,50,December 2018,"This is my 3rd stay at Ramada Encore it’s is the best place to be... great rooms and wonderful service by all staff, most of all being my birthday on the 6th the best room attendants made my bed up with happy birthday in rose petals Dipa you are just amazing our room was kept in top shape and thank you so much....We will return....Thank you Ramada Encore",Primera Hotel Seminyak
622,One of the Best,50,December 2018,"Everything was very good; Room, Staff, Pool, AC, Wifi, SPA, Breakfast, Housekeeping.

Restaurant Menu has a wide variety (including Indian and Vegetarian) and is competitively priced, except Beer which costs IDR 65000 in hotel compared to IDR 21000 in a nearby mini-market.

Note to Chef: Fried food was over fried, it made the meat tough to eat. I tried both duck and chicken, both were fried dry and could not be eaten. Indian food and Pizzas were okay, though rice portions are too small.

Wish List: The fridge in room could only cool my beer, not chill it. Bum wash water pressure was a bit too low.

Advice: Pay a bit more and select a Deluxe pool facing room instead of a Superior room. Do not worry if Google shows the hotel a bit away from market areas; the hotel offers a free drop-off to market areas, and anyways any city destination is within $3 to $10 if you use Blue Bird taxis.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
623,Another fantastic stay,50,November 2018,"Late post....I stayed at the Ramada Encore at the start of November with a family member. As soon as arrived, I immediately felt like I was back home. This was 5th stay at the Ramada so I knew what to expect and nothing has changed, the hospitality on offer is second to none. Hermanto took care of the room ensuring it was clean everyday and always check with us to ensure our stay was pleasant! We were greeted with big smiles from Dewi on reception as we come and go from the hotel. Food and Beverage staff, Novi, Reja Wijaya, Sri, Riski, Tari, Dila, Anggun looked after us every morning and a good selection of breakfast was on offer. As always, it was great to catch up with Aliando who is always on hand to help out with questions have a chat and also keep the pool area look great as well as all the pool team, Alit, Bob, Budi, Agus, Sepi. It your looking for a place to stay and an affordable price, look no further, clean rooms, great food, best pool out there and friendly welcoming staff. The Ramada will always be my home away from home.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
624,Fantastic,50,December 2018,I was concerned about the hotel being a fair way from the center of Seminyak but if you don’t mind a taxi ride or the free shuttle service the hotel has then it’s perfect. The staff are friendly and helpful. They answer all questions and go above and beyond to assist with everything. The buffet breakfast is outstanding with a great variety. Had multiple treatments at the Hotel spa. The Spa staff are lovely. The pool is clean and well maintained. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Pool view is a must. Room service is quick. Thank you Ramada and staff for a wonderful stay. We have a few more days with you and look forward to enjoying them.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
625,Great stay!,40,November 2018,"Stayed here for 7 days and throughly enjoyed my time here.

Pros

STAFF!
Attentive & very friendly staff from check in to security outside.

BREAKFAST!
Amazing selection of food here absolutely no complaints. My favorite would be the daily change of pastries. So much too chose.

BED, LINEN, PILLOWS
Could possibly be the comfiest bed I have ever slept on. Absolutely amazing.

CONS ..... IF ANY

Resort is a little out of the way of main area.

Housekeeping
Forgot to change on multiple times towels, soap and basically toiletries during daily cleaning but easily fixed once I notified them.

Everything else was fantastic.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
626,Friendly accommodation,50,December 2018,"Great accommodation, great pool especially aliando all who made us feel so welcome, like friends. Sitting at the pool he and Bob and agus were so friendly, a great asset to the establishment. Will deffinitely be back to catch up with them.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
627,Value for money hotel but location not that great,40,December 2018,"The hotel is located in a remote place and if you walk outside the hotel you will not find anything. The buzzing Seminyak square is around 2 kms from this hotel. So then you need to rely on the taxi all the time.

If you have your own vehicle then there is no problem at all.

Decent rooms and nice pool. Staff is very very friendly and helps you with everything and gives genuine advice.

All in all a good comfortable stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
628,Bali Vacay,50,November 2018,"My wife and me would highly recommend this place to stay in Bali. Awesome staff and we highly appreciate their hospitality and smile on each staff. We stayed for 5 nights and had dinner almost every day.Try out the dishes on their menu card, they are delicious and a delight to eyes too. One of their value added service is pool service which is wonderful to relax and perk to have an pool access room. It is bit inside Seminyak and not easy accessible to Kuta or Seminyak beach. But that’s keep it more relaxing area from hustle and bustle of the city. You can hire a scooter from the reception desk and move around the city.
Happy Stay and Happy Vacation!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
629,You pay for what you get,30,September 2018,"Well, you pay for what you get..
We didn't have high expectations after reading a few comments on TripAdvisor.
We only stayed here for three nights and this was our first stop in Bali. We had a bit of a jetlag so we were thankful to get some rest. The first night, there was a lot of rumour in the room next to ours.
Overall, the hotel is OK. The staff don't speak English as they should but they give it a try. We had a problem with our airconditioning (powercut) but they helped us out there first time, the second time we fixed it ourselves. The room was ok and clean. The bathroom was outdated.
The pool looked great but I can imagine that there are not enough beds for everyone. It was quite calm when we were there so we were lucky. Breakfast was so so, it could have been more inspired for european people.. when you want to go out, you'll need a taxi.

Overall, it's ok to spend one or two nights here but don't expect great luxury in here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
630,What a wonderful hotel,50,December 2018,Thank you so much for making our very first holiday easy and a pleasure. The Staff are number 1 and rooms are beautiful.

634,"Great hotel, excellent pool",40,November 2018,"Pool is fantastic and the rooms comfortable. Staff have been great. Food is average. Be careful some websites claim that all rooms have a balcony or terrace. This is not the case, you will need to pay extra for a balcony.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
635,Nice hotel,40,November 2018,"staying there for a night on 23rd November! The room was spacious and clean! All was going smoothly! Food are good especially the pork ribs was hitting the spot!!! Was an amazing experience!

the staff is good! but need some improvement especially when they are meeting the guest! they need tp smile and greet the guest like”swastiastu or good morning, etc”. so, the guest will feel like it is a home which is more than a home!!! cause i saw some staffs just flat when they are facing the guest and it’s not good! cause that’s the thing that i do i my workplace!

overall, its a pleasant stay and would like to comeback and stay longer!!! 👍🏻👍🏻",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The staff was so friendly.
Rooms was cleaned every day with fresh towels.
We was in the balcony room.
In the evening you can use the pool till 9pm.
Everybody was so relax.
There are a few shops in walking distance
I use the shuttle bus a few times.
Coming home used my Blue bird. It's just like uber. To get food in I used my Jerk app.

Breakfast was ok, if you want bacon you have to ask for it.

I did have a massage in the hotel as they had discount. That was excellent

Would recommend this hotel if you are on a budget.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
637,Holiday at Ramada Encore,50,November 2018,"I've stayed at Ramada Encore twice with friends and family, such a lovely hotel to stay at and relax. Rooms, staff, location, food and pool is a 10/10.

The staff changed our sheets and towels everyday, made sure we where doing okay and that we where enjoying our stay at the hotel.

641,"Lovely hotel, great staff, quiet location",40,November 2018,"This hotel is really good value for money. I booked a standard room for 7 nights and on arrival was upgraded to a pool view balcony room and given a privilege card which gave me discounts on meals, spa and late checkout.

The hotel and rooms are immaculately clean (not easy in such a humid environment). The staff are very well trained and I received nothing but the finest service. Special mention to Dipa in housekeeping - what a friendly, happy person he is! Everyday he refreshed my room so beautifully and when he was gone for a couple of days I asked him if he was on holidays - he said he was at home for a ceremony, and showed me photos on his phone. This is what makes Bali so special and will keep me coming back.

Pros
- great value, includes breakfast
- beautiful pool area
- very clean
- lovely staff
- attention to detail is first class

Cons
- the location is nice and quiet but it does mean taking taxis to get into the main part of Seminyak. Walking is possible but the roads are crazy.
- shuttle bus only leaves infrequently and has to be booked 24 hrs in advance to secure a spot.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
642,Relaxing getaway,50,November 2018,"My friends and I just got back from staying at this amazing resort for a week! The staff here are amazing and go out of their way to help.

Planning on going back to Bali in February and will definitely be staying here again! I miss this place already !!

Dewi and tita, I honestly cannot fault you both in any way, you’re both so amazing at what you do and I am so glad to have met you!! Thank you for making this place like a second home to me and making my holiday as memorable as possible !! See you all soon",Primera Hotel Seminyak
643,Good stay,40,November 2018,"We just loved the comfy pillows, the smiling welcoming faces daily at the breakfast bar, the summoning of a blue bird taxi or day driver as needed, the foxtel movie channels and the food on offer. Hotel is a little aged but service is superb!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
644,Wonderful resort in Seminyak,50,November 2018,We have stayed at this property multiple times now and it never fails to impress! The amazing staff are so genuinely friendly and accommodating and they make you feel so welcome. Ramada Encore is situated close to Seminyak restaurants and shops (AU$3-4 in BlueBird taxi) The resort itself is built around a magnificent lagoon style pool. General upkeep and cleanliness is excellent and the bedding is super comfortable. A wonderful restaurant which is open till 11pm and a fabulous extensive buffet breakfast. We would highly recommend Ramada Encore for your stay in Bali.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
645,Great hotel in Seminyak,40,September 2018,"Stayed in the 3 bedroom family suite,
11 year old, 17 year old, my wife and myself.
To be honest, the suite is way bigger than I thought.
Full size fridge, kitchen, 3 big bedrooms, 2 big bathrooms. Beds were very comfortable,
Double balcony overlooking the pool, by the way the pool is unbelievable, sit by your subbed and push a button for more drinks, or swim up to the bar, up to you.
Food was excellent, staff are also excellent. Coming from Australia, we were very impressed by the staff here.
We will be coming back for sure.
It is a little bit away from the beach, but the hotel will call you a blue bird taxi for $3-$4 aud it’s not a big deal at all.
Great hotel.
Would recommend honestly to anyone looking for a very new, clean, well trained staff and with a awesome pool,
and the way the staff say welcome home when you’ve been out shopping for the day is a great feeling.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
646,Good experience overall,40,November 2018,"Good experience overall, has gym (small and basic ) and nice options for breakfast (compared to other hotels I stayed in bali), swimming pool is awesome, very clean and visible water had a great experience swimming.(depth is less overall)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
647,Sarthak Goyal,40,November 2018,Good hotel. Value for money. Has a wide variety of food and provides a decent menu for vegetarians that is generally difficult to find in Bali. This hotel also provides a shuttle service to Kuta-Seminyak and also has a 7/11 store nearby. Must Visit.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
648,Birthday Holiday,50,November 2018,"AMAZING.... fantastic rooms, fantastic staff, fantastic pool, BRILLIANT food. Could not fault it, sure there were improvements they could do, e.g. music was a bit loud and not to my taste (dance club music that played at breakfast and too late into night) but once in room couldn’t hear it and AT breakfast when I asked them to turn it down they did, the wooden flootboards around pool and restaurant area needed fixing (was scared I’d fall through) but in no way did this affect my holiday negativity. After all a holiday is what you make it. Area - it is a fair way from anything and this worried me before the trip but so easy to get a taxi, they will book it for you and minimum price into Seminyak $3AUD. I highly recommend this resort and will definitely be back. Was amazed could get such a lovely resort at such a low cost, thank you to all staff and management at Ramada Encore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
649,Great stay,50,November 2018,"Really good place to stay with friendly staff especially Aliando, Alit and Bob! Breakfast is amazing, so many choices at the buffet.
Location is maybe far from the centre, but there is a free shuttle service.

I will never forget Aliando!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
650,Perfect! but a bit out of Seminyak,50,November 2018,"Can't find fault, at such a low price we were a little worried. But the whole place is Fab. Staff lovely, rooms clean & well equipped. Pool area perfect, breakfast everything you can imagine is there, from cornflakes to curry! Bar is well stocked & a good place to social drink & chat to other guests. Guess everybody was out & about all day because breakfast was a little busy, but the rest of the day you had the pool area almost to your self. Guests from all parts of the world. If it wasn't so far from the UK I would definitely go again.
But very few places around to walk to, it was 1 & half miles out of Seminyak but that's only £1.50 in a taxi. So it's peaceful location might be a down side, or as we found it a bonus!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
651,Great Hotel,40,November 2018,"Had a lovely time at this hotel.
Great pool and couldn’t fault any of the staff.
Meals were all good.
The only feedback I would give is that there could be two toasters for breakfast and maybe some muesli wouldn’t go astray.
Will definitely be back.

653,Great Stay - Close to everything but private,40,October 2018,"I had a great stay at the Ramada encore. Despite waiting a little while to be checked in, once we had checked in, it was a breeze from there. The room was very clean, the beds were extremely comfortable and I was happy that we had a T.V that had english speaking channels. The Ramada is not on the main street in Seminyak, you will have to order a taxi through the front desk, but that is easy enough. I like how you can just ask for a taxi and sit down and relax and wait. Then they come to get you when your bluebird taxi has arrived. The pools were very relaxing and cold. I would only suggest having signs regarding pool towels as we did not know at first how to get one. The food was good. A large variety. I wouldn't eat there everyday. Overall a good stay and worth your money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
654,Great service,50,November 2018,"Great place! Good food, swimming pool is nice and great service! The staff are very welcoming and happy to help. Highly recommend, I’ll be coming back again. It is not to far from the beach or airport either. Gusna is a great employee. Look out for him.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
655,Very Good with some notes,30,November 2018,"Hotel lobby are amazing, breakfast and other food are good, room are excellent


however room service is another story, late room cleaning and a laundry are not being pick up

Building design also had issue with the lift placement it is annoying which is far back behind hotel, some corridor need more lights or white wallpaper color

Breakfast music was horrible! The playing DJ club music in middle of morning breakfast. Is making the entire feeling going badly",Primera Hotel Seminyak
656,Worth for money,50,November 2018,"Enjoyed staying , excellent room and customer service. We had the best room service and infrastructure. The food was excellent but we had a feedback to add on that. As we booked for vegeterian dish, we had quite less number of vegeterian dishes in the resturant.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
657,"Beautiful, clean, great staff",50,November 2018,"We stayed here for 6 nights. We were a group of 9 and the reception staff managed to put all of our rooms close together. The pool was immaculate, as was the rest of the hotel. If you were to walk around you would find someone cleaning something all the time. The rooms were big, the air conditioning worked, the bathrooms were a little small, but adequate. The only things that I can complain about is the fridge in the rooms- we had 4 rooms, and not one fridge was actually cold, the pool towel system is a little confusing and it’s a little bit far from the main hub in Seminyak. Otherwise, there is nothing to complain about here. Highly recommend staying, and if I come back to Bali, would seriously consider staying here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
658,Best price deal,40,November 2018,"Our stay in Ranada Encore is unforgettable. It was near to major destinations. Once we arrived early around 9AM and it was not yet our check-in time, they offered 1 room wherein we can put our luggage and preferably change into something comfortable to start our itinerary that day. That made an impact giving consideration to visitors who come in earlier. We booked 2 rooms. The rooms were very clean and staff were very courteous, The breakfast buffet was very good but would be better to have it earlier (open at 6:30AM) since almost all visitors have early itineraries it would be better if they open at 6AM. Another downside is the Spa wherein they charge double than the others outside of the hotel. Overall the best price deal for a 4-star hotel. Will definitely come back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Our room was at 5243 which was AWAY from the elevator (I got lost that time), the corridor was dark & narrow. Room was spacious, good bed quality, but unfortunately it was no-smoking room, and we aren't allow to open the window. I think they didn't have any smoking room, but i'm not so sure. Bed quality was good, hot water worked properly, drainage also good.

We loved both pool and pool-bar. They have a huge & nice pool. FYI, you have to take a pool access card on the receptionist to get free towel. They have lots benches and several cabanas.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

662,"Location is very bad, not even a supermarket is within a walking distance.",10,November 2018,"We spent only one night , despite we paid for two night non refundable , we left the hotel after one night. Nothing special, we thought it is a Wyndham hotel but it isn’t, they use the name Wyndham for misleading. We came from Wyndham in tamansari which is luxury, to Ramada, disappointment. You get what you pay for .",Primera Hotel Seminyak
663,Great place,50,December 2017,I loved staying here. It is a little tucked away but great none the less. Loved the pool. My kids loved room service. Would stay here again. Hubby loved the massage. The breakfast buffet was nice. We stayed in a three bedroom apartment with two baths and kitchen. Very nice.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
664,Nice 4 star hotel,40,September 2018,"Stayed for 4 nights here. Its a good hotel for the price, facilities, service. Breakfast is very good, lots of choice, quiet area. Big pool, rooms just right size. Definitely coming back if i can get good deal.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
665,Review,30,October 2018,"It's a good looking hotel with a nice big swimmingpool and nice and clean rooms. The staff is very friendly but also very irritating. When you finished your roomservice order they call you to ask how it was and if i'm already finished. Then they say put it outside the room. This call will come everytime when you order roomservice and they don't mind how late it is.

Also the big point is that I got VERY SICK of the food in the restaurant. I got a bacterie and needed to go to the hospital for medicines and hydration. For me this is an indication for a kitchen what is not clean and food that has expired by date.

After all, we had a nice stay but after my sickness I didn't dare to eat in the hotel anymore. Please be carefull what you are order.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
666,Nice big pool,40,November 2018,"Been here many times, but just for a meeting with my clients. Always want to swimm here as the pool positioned in the mid of the hotel which is mean its on the shade. I can swimm anytime i want without wory about geting burn. I am sory, Asian woman always scared to get dark haha..
I do love to swimm here. The entrance ticket also affordable and include welcome drink, towel and meal. Juices also fresh.
Happy to swimm here. No wonder my friends always stay here whenever they visit Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
667,"Great accommodation, great holiday trip.",50,October 2018,"We have just spent 7 days in this gorgeous hotel. Everything was excellent, especially the staffs were so friendly and helpful, they are well trained, I am metioning to Ika, another girl that I talked to in front of the entrance to restaurant.
We were arranged the warm, neat and beautiful Executive Deluxe room on 4th floor, which has perfect view down the pool and silent area.
I love the pool with creative design, I love the noon we spent almost 2hrs to enjoyed calamari rings, swam, read books and set mind free.
I will be back then soon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
668,Anniv Vacation,40,November 2018,"Overall, we had very comfort sleep during our days in Bali..
The little one like the pool a lot..the environment are also nice..
But, Im wondering why the all floor in room are always wet? Eventhough we not use the bathroom?
The surprise ‘happy wedding...’ text on bed are also beyond my expectation.. thank you so much..
Will be back again someday!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
669,Good stay,30,November 2018,"The hotel has all what you expect from a four stars hotel, it was so crowded (specially of Chinese people) but even that it was quiet. Nice pool, it’s a hotel for holiday stays or business stays too.
The restaurant offers standard quality meals and the rooms are good enough, a bit small for couples in my opinion but perfect for a single one.
Well located and the staffs are so gentle and professional.
I just post one picture to remind the good cappuccino I enjoyed, the pictures you can see here or in the hotel website is the same you’ll find, no surprises.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
670,Superb service expect bagus,50,October 2018,"Hotel is clean, beautiful and not to mention the amazing service. Staff is so friendly and warm. The breakfast buffet had a good spread. If u are staying there u must try their amazing spa. We only had one bad experience, a staff member called bagus clearly hated us for some reason. He refused to give us a late check out (we were willing to pay the 50%) rest of the group got the late check out without an issue because the other person at the reception didn’t make any fuss. But bagus hated us and refused to accommodate our late check out request. Next day morning we checked with another person at the reception and she happily accommodated our request. Regardless this issue I still think this is a good hotel. Just avoid any interaction with bagus at the reception. They had shuttle service, we didn’t use it but I’m sure it’s useful for the travelers.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
671,Mrs,50,November 2018,Fantastic hotel! We received a free upgrade to a pool view with a balcony. Air con and room service fantastic. Hotel staff can’t do enough for you they are so polite and professional. Service round the pool is also excellent and the food is amazing!! We booked breakfast too which was great with a wide selection. Spotlessly clean. We booked for a massage and spa treatment during happy hour. Rates excellent and treatments amazing! Would definitely return to this hotel,Primera Hotel Seminyak
672,Couldn’t ask for more,50,October 2018,"Stayed for five days as part of a cruise package. Wasn’t sure what to expect and was delighted to find a lovely hotel with great facilities. Staff are attentive, food is delicious. The pool is lovely but loses the sun late afternoon (4pm ish). The spa is fabulous and the prices there are good too.
Directly outside on the street isn’t very scenic but a very short walk will take you to shops and some restaurants and a taxi to some of the best places won’t hurt your pocket. We went to jimbaran beach to a seafood restaurant on the sand and watched the sunset. Seminyak beach also nice, ku de ta had delicious food. Kuta beach I didn’t like - too busy and commercialised. A trip out can take you to some of the most beautiful areas, waterfalls, temples and wildlife.
A taxi from the airport is around £5, only use bluebird taxis they use meters and don’t rip you off.
The hotel is fab! Loved it",Primera Hotel Seminyak
673,Worth it,40,October 2018,"Very nice, cleaned, breakfast is super. Worth the money and well centered. If you are looking for something safe, cleaned and you’ll be spend most of the time our then is the perfect place. Leo the driver was very nice and organized some trips for us . He was also a good company during our trips - safe and discreet in general. Thanks again Leo",Primera Hotel Seminyak
674,Cost effective and good,40,November 2018,Good and cheap hotel with all amenities. The only negative point is that it is situated inn very interior in Seminyak. We stayed for 2 nights and it was a pleasure. Food was good. We took the added breakfast and the spread was quite vast.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
675,Chefrobertson,40,November 2018,"Room adequate staff very friendly and helpful.food good beer cheap enough wine very over the top.£21.00.for bottle you would buy at home for £5/6.00.

677,Fantastic resort,50,October 2018,"Stayed here for 10 days. Beautiful resort; nice rooms, fantastic breakfast. Staff are amazing very friendly and always accommodating.

678,Nice Hotel for the prize. Location may be not the best...not worst either,40,October 2018,"I stayed here with my Wife for 2 nights. Not bad. Menu even has distinctive indian options. Room and service were good. Breakfast okay...no complaints there.
It has a nice large pool which is the most distinctive part of the property. Overall a nice hotel for the price. A little far (about 3 km) from the semiyank beach and semiyank-square. But they have free shuttle service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

We went there with our 20m.o daughter and found nothing but happiness from her. We loved the swimming pool, the bedroom is also great and the services were great from the staff.
It is very recommended place to stay :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak

682,Comfortable stay for couples and families,40,October 2018,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was a pleasant experience. I'd recommend booking pool facing rooms which offer a great view of the resort. Breakfast is reasonably good, with plenty of local and international cuisine options. Staff is friendly, however needs to be more pro-active. The only drawback ( kind of) is it's located a bit far away from Kuta beach and walking there can be very challenging. However, hotel staff is courteous enough to book Blue bird taxis if you need them.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
683,Leanne,50,October 2018,Awesome place would definitely come again. Staff are very friendly and pricing for accommodation and bar/food is reasonably priced. Families and couples would definitely love this place. Thanks for a great holiday 👍,Primera Hotel Seminyak
684,Amazing staff and service,40,October 2018,"Staff members are very helpful and sweet.. beautiful view of pool from the room specially in night.. totally loved the stay and would give a rating of more than 4, breakfast can be made better as too monotonous if you are staying for more than 3-4 days",Primera Hotel Seminyak

686,Excellent Hotel for the price,40,October 2018,"Superb pool, good rooms, reasonably priced food, excellent buffet breakfast!
Location slightly off so you always need a cab to move out, walking not an option, although not a deal breaker.
The kids loved the pool.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
687,Hidden but comfortable stay,40,August 2018,"The hotel is a bit hidden, off the main road so if you don't have your own transport, its rather inconvenience. We liked the room as its very spacious especially the balcony which is facing the pool in the courtyard. There were free wifi and good selection of amenities. The staff was polite and quite helpful. I wasn't sure if it because of the undergoing renovation but they placed the elevator far back from the lobby so a lot of unnecessary walking just to get in and out of the room. Overall wouldn't hesitate to stay there again in the future.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
688,Hmmmm,20,October 2018,"Hmm not really sure to start with this review. I’m gonna keep it simple..

good points:

Friendly staff
Pool was never too full
Food was reasonably priced
Nice large reception area
WiFi worked well in room

Areas for improvement:

Rooms are noisy - we had to move 3 times to try and get a room quiet enough to get a good nights sleep I was so disappointed after looking forward to relaxing so long needless to mention moving room was very disruptive!! Even in our final room far from reception we could still here people in the pool, we were on the 3rd floor and at 5.45am every morning you can here the man downstairs (ground floor) sweeping.

Cleaning staff were inconsistent - as I moved rooms a feeble times I noticed that some staff were more meticulous than others. For example in one room it took us ages to get a hand towel and when we did it would not get changed. Towards the end we also noticed are bed sheets were not changed, not sure if they were changed since we had been there. Under the beds were not cleaned.

The pool area is dangerous - please if you do go be careful. There are wooden panels around the pool area that are very loose. I tripped on them a few times. My friend also fell but ended up in hospital with a fractured foot and twisted ankle. Staff were slow to respond and offered us a late checkout for free as if there was any other option.

There were a number of petty issues but I’m not trying to slander the hotel. I personally would not stay there again and would not recommend it to others.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
689,Paradise,40,October 2018,"We stayed there for our honeymoon and we had an amazing time. The staff were so friendly and helpful.
The lagoon pool was fantastic, clean and the lounges in the shallows was so relaxing.
The food was top class, and the buffet breakfast was awesome.
The spa was so beautiful and relaxing and the spa staff were wonderful and thoughtful.
The only negative was not large enough shuttle cars, the could do with a mini bus have such a large amount of guests, and the dace music that plays morning till night.

They could have a pool movie night and that would be popular but other than that it was awesome.
Happy honeymooners",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The deluxe room we had overlooked the pool and restaurant, the beds and pillows were very comfortable all in all a very comfy room.
The staffs are giving a warm services, good smile, so helpful.
The breakfast varieties is ok, it serves a western food and asian food including indonesia food. But the quality of the breakfast is just OK & plain taste, more flavors added will be tasted better. The receptionist could help out the guest for booking a taxi.
Satisfaction is accepted for this hotel! Good job team",Primera Hotel Seminyak
694,"Good Hotel, Bad Transportation Handling",30,September 2018,"Ramada Encore is a good hotel with a good location that close to seminyak and kuta. But with it spot is at the end of an alley, what really bother me is they won't allow us to book online transportation such as Grab Car and Go-Car instead they opt for the expensive travel that cost 10x then usual price. I won't recommend to stay at this hotel if you don't rent your own car.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
695,Very Good Hotel,40,September 2018,"Staying with my wife for two days from 4-6 September 2018 booked through MMT. I opted for Pool facing Executive Deluxe. Room is very good.

Thanks for guest relation Tish who helped us alot with recommendation! Hope she enjoy a gift we left for her! We'll definitely come back next year!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
698,"Excellent service, customer suited infrastructure and a refreshing stay",50,September 2018,"One of the best things about Ramada encore that we loved was the way the staff treated its guests. Everyone had a smile on their face and they were very helpful and welcoming. Thats the part we will remember about Bali most.
We had stayed for 5 days in the month of September and were celebrating our daughters first birthday. The room service made it extra special by decorating the room for us and providing us with a beautiful baby cot. Our little princess was just delighted with the setup.
We were given a Delux room which was clean and spacious with a balcony facing the pool. It had good safety glass in the balcony so our kid could not crawl out. The view is excellent. The pool is really well maintained inspite of being spread across the hotel. It is always refreshing to look at the pool from the balcony.
Housekeeping staff was very through with their job and always made sure our room was well supplied and clean. The service requests were also quickly responded to by housekeeping unlike some other hotels.
Staff at the restaurant like Linda and Arta have a very pleasant and smiling face and are very helpful to the guests. Linda particularly made our daughter want to come back to the restaurant to say ""hi"" to her. They were were nice and made our restaurant experience very pleasant. If you go, try to ask for them and they will be very helpful :).
Tita the manager at the reception is one of the epitomes of service that I have seen. She ensured that our stay in the hotel and Bali was well looked after and checked on us regularly to make sure we were comfortable (the big deal- she was on holiday when we checked in and still made sure our stay was good).
The hotel has a kids corner a gym and a pool - all of which is well maintained and with working equipment. You would need to walk a little to reach the main road but then the climate was really good for a walk so we did that. You can try a taxi if you dont want to walk.
Overall, the hotel was lovely and we recommend it for a relaxing stay. We look forward to go back if we get a chance.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
699,Nice property but dissappointing check in service.,30,September 2018,"The property is nice and clean, but a bit remote so you have to take a taxi to go to the eating places. Nice swimming pool and restaurant. Good internet connection. Unfortuantely very dissappointing check in service, we were a group of 4, arrived at the hotel at about 2:00 pm and was requested to wait for another 30 minutes to make the room ready but after some question, we got our first room at about 3:30 pm and just after some strong complain the second room was ready only at 4:45 pm.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
700,Nice hotel but THIEF STAFF !!!,10,September 2018,"We stayed this hotel in the beginning of my first trip to Bali with my girlfriend. Our room was very good with pool access and comfortable. The breakfast was very good and the restaurant is perfectly nice. Service, food quality was really good and prices are really reasonable. But...
In our first hours was great at all. Next day after we woke up and when we were out of our balcony side (which is pool access side next to window) one of the housekeeping stuff was come in our room without door knocking and while we are outside. We even did not see him inside and did not know that he came in! Eventhough we saw him few minutes than he came in. After we saw him we told we do not need cleaning. While after he went out and we realized that some of our money (1.200.000 rupi which makes around 80 usd) was stolen from our bag . Same day we have spoken with guest relation staff but they did not anything about this unacceptable situation. ( btw I went to the guest relation desk to talk about that issue very kind way) They just tryed to show me security camera records which is out side of the rooms in next day and that is not prove anything! That robbery has happened and after 1 day they showed us that records!!! Can you belive that ?!
Guest relation clerk told us that staff stayed in the room for 2 minutes and she showed up the records. Imagine, he did not change towels, did not clean the room and did not do anything in that 2 minutes! Except that robbery has happened!
Finally nobody did anything about that situation. We were thinking to extend our stay but we checked out immediately. Except we have spoken about that issue, no one care about us anymore, they even could not look at our face
As I say room, ambiance of the pool, breakfast, restaurant was good but i don't reccomend that hotel because of their thief staff!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
701,Always satisfying,50,September 2018,"Got a room upgrade, delicious breakfast (off the menu, u can request a crispy pork bacon from the egg station), seamless service by great staffs, spacy parking lot and just a minutes drive to Gusto gelato and Seminyak(s) famous eateries, and with a reasonable price, what r u asking more? Definitely recommended. And they gave us a gift since my wife is pregnant. Remarkable! :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
702,The minibar/fridge,40,September 2018,"Beautiful hotel, big swimming pool. The location is quiet far from the beach, but they provided shuttle bus to Kuta and Seminyak area. The thing that i didn't like is their minibar/fridge. They said the fridge is for refreshing only not to make the drink cool. But for me the temperature is too warm, make the drinks that i bought warmer instead of colder, put it outside the fridge is much better, we can put our drinks at the reception, but that's not flexible enough. Please fix about this fridge thing. Thank you.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
703,"Great property, nice amenities = Good holiday",40,September 2018,"Liked the property, good food, reasonable rates and hospitable staff.
Location is a bit out, but you can get all you need in the hotel.

Yup... Large room and nice staff, I had a wonderful time here! I enjoyed it very much! A like home feeling, Thanks for the beautiful memories, So Thank ful for Ramada Encore make my day wonderful, Can't think of anything, really recommended this place ;)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
705,Very average,30,September 2018,"My girlfriend and I stayed 7 nights at the Ramada and left fairly MEH About the whole hotel.

CHECK IN: the biggest issue at this hotel.

Check in is at 3 which is late to start with, and unlike any other hotel I have stayed in they stick to there guns on it!

We arrived at 11am and our room was not ready until just after 3, there were many other people sat around waiting for there rooms and every day we bypassed the lobby there was another group of arrivals waiting for there room!

THE ROOM- very average, good size and nice and clean and comfortable bed.

However there is a random fridge/food storage that is set to be room temperature so completely unecassry. Also the curtains don’t cover the balcony doors so light gets in and out very easily and also the doors do not block out any noise from corridor or the restaraunt downstairs.

The tv picture is very poor and you have to play very loudly to block out surrounding noise.

THE RESTAURANT- breakfast is AMAZING and the best thing about the hotel 10 dollars for all you can eat and can have just about anything you like.

Outside of breakfast the restaurant is very poor.. food is really average and service, Altho the individuals are pleasant and try hard, is just very slow.

The pool is lovely and food and drinks around pool very cheap but due to design of hotel there is only about 4 chairs that have sun on them all day, outside of that you are sat in warm shade!

The staff are all lovely, smiley and polite but the hotel is just a little bit average

It’s also very difficult to order a taxi from the cheaper apps due to hotel and franchised drivers being at war!

Bali is a beautiful place and the hotel looks nice from first impressions but just to many small issues add up to make it very average.

Would probably look elsewhere if I were to return to bali!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
706,Ordinary Location,20,September 2018,"I recently stayed at the Ramada Encore with my daughter, we initially arrived at 3pm for check however room was not ready until 5pm. We the got and “upgrade” however this room was not the room we booked and was certainly not an upgrade, no refund for the inferior room. All food and beverage was expensive and very little choice the breakfast and pool were good. Staff very friendly. Spa is over priced but very good massage. We had to leave the hotel early due to a family emergency and again no refund, just basically thanks for your money and see ya. You have to catch a taxi everywhere, you can’t just walk out to another restaurant. A very upsetting and underwhelming experience at this hotel. We would not recommend staying.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
707,Great service,50,September 2018,"Thankyou to all the staff at Ramada resort especially veta who helped organise my mums birthday cake and amazing friendly service !!! 5 star Thankyou from me, my mum and Kristen we definitely would choose this resort again :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
708,Holiday Trip,50,September 2018,Had a pleasant stay at Ramada Encore Bali. Food was very good. Shuttle to semiyank square and kuta beach walk. Room where very clean and nice. Staff was very polite and friendly. Breakfast was auosome.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
709,Very pleasant hotel,40,August 2018,"The hotel was very pleasant . It is built on a small plot so there are no grounds for walking about in garden. The food was excellent with a good choice for breakfast . The food at lunch or dinner is very reasonable .
Our suite had 3 bedrooms and was ideal for families . The pool is good but there is very little sun after 4 pm due to the fact the buildings put the pool into shadow
The drive into the hotel is not impressive but once in the hotel is good and the spa is amazing and very reasonable",Primera Hotel Seminyak
710,Not nice,10,September 2018,Arrived after 10 pm rooom still not ready. Towels were a disgrace and looked filthy. Room wasn't very clean with under the bed having not been swept. The 'cloth ' used to clean the tables in the restaurant were black. ..wouldn't use them to clean my windows. Hotel was up a dirt track in the middle of nowhere and due to the state of the road and laclick of street lightening not very safe to venture out. Shuttle bus available to take you to Kuta or Seminyak but had the hassle of getting your own way home. The only good thing was that the staff were polite and helpful and we were allowed to keep our room till 5 pm on the day of our departure as my husband had been ill as a result of food poisoning contracted while at this hotel.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
711,Pleasant,30,June 2018,"We had a two night stay here whilst celebrating a friends birthday. The hotel put petals on their bed which was a lovely touch. We didnt spend much time in the hotel as we were out and about. The location of the hotel was ok but was a bit further out from central Seminyak than we expected. There was taxis going from the hotel on call which was great. On our final morning we went down for breakfast, we had not paid for this as a part of our stay but asked if we could add it on for this day. In most hotels its just added on to your room tab, however, they made the fuss of wanting cash there and then. After going back to our room to get money and paying we settled on a table. This table was not set, we politely asked the nearest member of staff where the cutlery was and she replied 'I don't know', shook her head rudely and walked off. When we eventually managed to ask another member of staff he rudely told us to wait and sloped off. After a five minute wait we eventually got the cutlery. On the other hand the breakfast selection was great. The room size and cleanliness were great. No hairdryer in the room. A pleasant stay minus the rudeness of the staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
712,More than perfect,50,September 2018,"The hotel is perfect, clean rooms, nice pool, delicious breakfast with many varieties, the staff is super friendly.
I called Tita before arriving and she offered us a free upgrade because it was our first honeymoon. She also made special arrangement in the room and surprised us with a delicious cake to celebrate our honeymoon. She is super friendly and helped us to plan our visit to Bali although she was on maternity leave. Also she gave me a special gift before leaving the hotel. We will remember her for the rest of our lives as she made our visit to Bali unforgettable. Thank you so much Tita.
For couple, families or even a group of friends I would highly recommend this hotel and definitely come back again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
713,Perfect Hotel,50,September 2018,"The Hotel is perfect, clean rooms, delicious breakfast, very friendly staff, nice pool. I enjoyed my first honeymoon there with special gift from the staff. I would recommend it to anyone and definitely come back again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
714,Getaway,30,September 2018,"We booked via booking.com due to pricing on offer. We didnt realise how far the hotel is from seminyak but walking was a good option for us.
In my review there will be some positives and negatives.
I will start with the positives.
Check in was a breeze. There were a few people checking in late afternoon with us. Receptionists were fast and professional.
The staff are all very young but friendly. Some speak perfect English while others not so.
Our room was on the 2nd floor facing the pool. We had booked a deluxe room.
The bed was a king bed and one of the most comfortable beds I had slept on. The pillows were amazing! The room was a standard size with a kettle and tea and coffee. Milk is the cream in a sachet version.
The pool was fantastic. Excellent size and the design was great but in hinesite not the best for sunbathing. The afternoon sun put the pool in the shade most if the day.
Nearby the hotel are a couple of dairies. They stock clearly for tourists, mostly water, beer, chips, noodles and biscuits. Although the water is free at the hotel. Standard 2 bottles per day it does have an odd taste to it. I preferred buying my water which had a seal to break rather than a twist lid.
On the downside there is smoking everywhere. I thought it was a non smoking hotel, as no smoking is permitted in your rooms. However you can smoke on the balcony and just about everywhere else, such as the pool and even in the restaurant. It was bad enough trying to find a non smoking table when some clown would bring an ashtray over to the table next to you and start smoking.
People even smoked on the loungers semi submerged in the water. I even saw one guy flick his ash in the pool.there are no signs anywhere about not smoking and staff turn a blind eye. Hence if I return to Bali, I would be hesitant to book this hotel again due to the smoking.
The food was lovely and reasonably priced which was a bonus. As myself and my partner got caught with Bali belly we sadly didnt venture out much.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
715,Perfect,40,September 2018,"Perfect place to stay in SEMINYAK area. Very helpful staff and beautiful poor with excellent food makes it perfect for anyone who do not want to overspend. It is bit far from Seminyak Square but they do have free transfer (only to drop off) and that’s helpful. Check in time is 3pm and bit late than most of the hotels and do not try your luck by coming early you may have to wait until 3pm.
Rooms are comfortable and there was nothing to complain about. Overall it is well worth the money you spend.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
716,Room was not ready until 6:30PM!!,10,September 2018,"Breakfast was great but that’s about it.

Our family room for 5 persons was not available for us until 6:30pm after we had arrived right on check in time.

We had appointments at 4pm, which half of us had to cancel as all of our luggage had to be kept laying around in the foyer which had to be looked after. Reception were not helpful at all but blamed the delay on ‘pillowcases not ready’.

This issue seemed to be a problem for everyone both days we were there.

The toilets in the room were not cleaned well.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
717,Bad service,10,September 2018,The service was very bad at this hotel. The check in and out information was written below the listing price very far from a persons view. So i arrived there at 1400 and was only given the key at 1520 and yet the room was not ready and there were repairing the ceiling when i went up. In the end i canceled the room beacause of the bad service. This is the worse service i ever received from a hotel.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
718,Great hotel in convenient location,50,September 2018,"There's nothing negative to say about our stay here. Everything was superb, starting from our welcome to the lovely tropical ambience, friendly staff, lavish breakfast, enchanting cocktails, free drop-offs by shuttle bus, very reasonable food prices ... the list goes on. Will stay only here on our repeat visits.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
719,Enjoyable stay,50,September 2018,"Stayed in the hotel for 5 days. Got a free upgrade. Thank u for that.

Checkin process
Very fast. Booked three room and arrive late but the checkin was smooth.

The room
The room we got is deluxe facing the pool. Really enjoy it. It was clean. The ac was super cold which I like it. Unlike most of the hotel in bali the ac was taken care of quite well.

The bathroom
Too small. Cannot do much about it

Room service.
No complain about this.

Cleaning service.
Sometimes the room was not cleaned. We have to call. But they came quickly.

Restaurant.
Enjoying countless dinner there. Tried the nasi goreng, pork ribs, pizza, salad, pad thai and many others. We love the pizza and nadi goreng. Although some day the nasi goreng get too salty. Need a bit of consistency

Breakfast
The breakfast offer quite varieties. Love the bacon and egg.

Check out process.
Super fast.

Very recommended hotel. Quite and relaxing",Primera Hotel Seminyak
720,Visiting Seminyak,20,September 2018,"Staff at this hotel were friendly and welcoming. However Hotel check in and check out times challenging and shuttle services into Seminyak Central were almost all full unless booked well in advance. And shuttle does not return so taxi is required and due to traffic can be expensive. There was nothing of interest within walking distance of this hotel. Smoking and vapourisers were allowed in the dining area and in the pool. There were cigarette burns in the furniture on my balcony and ash everywhere. Late check out was not available nor were any alternatives offered by staff, other than to hold bag.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
721,Very good quality and value,50,September 2018,"The hotel was quite easy to find with GPS.
The room was clean and spacious. Comfortable bed. Hotel staff are helpful and pleasant.
Nice swimming pool.
Breakfast was really good and everything was freshly baked and made.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
722,Excellent hotel,50,August 2018,"Can’t speak highly of this hotel. Facilities, staff, location are all excellent. The hotel is very clean and the staff are a credit to the hotel so so friendly and helpful. Food is very good. The hotel is out the way a little but this what makes it so good but still only a short walking distance to shops.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
723,Very very nice,50,July 2018,"We stayed here for 8 nights and its was really nice. Breakfast is a buffee so thats really good, rooms are awesome nd wifi vonnection is strong. Staff is very jelpful and friendly, pool area is soooo pretty!!! Oh also food is great!!! So overall, very nice hotel. :P",Primera Hotel Seminyak
724,It's ok and not 4 star,10,September 2018,The hotel is not 4 star quality in terms of services or front office office and room service. Rooms are good and pool has a lovely setup. On floor staff are very kind and well mannered. But still lacks the 4 star quality and luxury you expect . Having stayed in other ramadas this is by far the worst. Too far away from the main road and too expensive rental package.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
725,Very Nice Hotel,40,September 2018,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel, Nice staff, spacious room, and the pillows are awesome, very comfortable, luckily we got a free room upgrade to poolside, and the pool is awesome. breakfast is better than mostly 4 starred hotel in bali, hotel location is not the best, online taxi (grab, gocar) not allowed to pick you up in the hotel area. but you can still order bluebird taxi. its <IDR 80k to ngurah rai airport. there are free shuttle from hotel to seminyak and kuta. Ok, very nice hotel, would be coming back or recommend to friend to stay at ramada encore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
726,Amazing place and amazing staff,50,September 2018,"Ican't describe how much I enjoyed my stay in this hotel, started from when I just booked my honeymoon then I sent a mail to hotel to confirm my reservation then the magic appears called ""titaaaaaa she is the most professional guest relation manager I have ever met, she makes everything possible"" my room was decorated with very beautiful things hearts 💕, cake 🎂, alot of manything else and give me a souvenir ..

728,It’s Okey,30,August 2018,"Pretty secluded from the crowd areas, Ramada is a quiet place for resting, with two large swimming pools for kids and adults. We had a room that took a rather far route from the lobby, so it’s not preferable. Nothing much to say, since we didn’t spent much time at the hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
729,Ramada Encore Stay........ Marisa Steve & Christian,40,July 2018,"First time in Bali with my Family. Staff always welcomed there guests with a smile.
Pool was great, Breakfast was always filling, ( Loved there broth for Breakfast it was the best ) Rooms were spacious and clean...
Gardens were kept so maintained.
We met one of the Garden Maintenance "" Aliando Ali "" nice guy always working hard and looking after the resort ( gardens).

730,Ramada Encore Stay,50,August 2018,This was oor first time im Bali and Thank god i picked the perfect place to stay . Amazing pool . Rooms are spacious and clean . Great breakfast included. Shuttles to centre and Kuta . Would be nice if available on way back as well. Especially a late one . Biggest plus is the hardworking and the staff are so pleasant. Meals are amazing only fault cocktails are very weak. I wull be back for sure. Bargain,Primera Hotel Seminyak
731,We love this hotel!!!,50,August 2018,Ramada Encore has very comfort room and all staffs always smiling to us. The breakfast has many choices and the pool was amazing. Many thanks to all the staffs there and For sure we will coming back again.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
732,Everything is amazing! I have no complaints whatsoever!,50,August 2018,Im really loving this hotel and I would think of coming here again if I come back to Bali anytime soon. The rooms are really good to share. The bed is big enough to fit two people comfortably without touching the other. Love it!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
733,Amazing Pool,40,August 2018,"We spent a week at this hotel, we were booked into a superior room which I thought by the photos had a balcony however on arriving seen that it didn't and had a view of the roof of the restaurant and electricity cables. We asked if we could upgrade and we could for $15 a night to a deluxe pool view room. This room was faultless, a lovely balcony which offered privacy still with the palm tree in front, on the 3rd floor. Air conditioning was perfect, bed was a true king size and very comfortable, a very clean room which was serviced every day. Admittedly the servicing was quite often done very late in the day which was annoying if you were wanting to shower after a busy day and head out for dinner. Location was not the best and took a while to get anywhere but we did know this due to reading other reviews on this site. The 4pm shuttle from hotel into Kuta took 3 hours which according to the driver takes this long every day at this time, maybe this should be brought to the attention of guests before you decide to use it. Buffet breakfast was beautiful, other meals eaten there were good too although a lot of the menu was not traditional but I guess they are catering for everyone. Used the spa for massage and this too was faultless. Staff all very polite and would go out of there way to help. A beautiful pool and outside area, well equipped gym and well maintained gardens. If you are wanting a lovely hotel but don't mind being out of the way of shopping and restaurants then I definitely recommend to stay here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
734,Good place to stay,40,May 2018,"Clean place to stay a bit far out of the hussle and bustle of it all . The massage at resort was amazing staff very friendly , courtesy his into place was good too . Felt safe . Pool area was big , waiter staff doing pool service very attentive",Primera Hotel Seminyak
735,First timer to bali,40,August 2018,"We came to bali for my daughters wedding .. i had never really wanted to travel to bali before..but im now a tad hooked..Ramada Encore Seminyak was perfect for us with all we needed to totally indulge and relax..Rooms clean and comfortable..Food was yum for breakfast ,lunch and dinner.. Must also give a huge thank you to our amazing driver Oka who also is a part of Ramada who was awesome and fun....Will definately stay here again on my next visit Thankyou to all the staff",Primera Hotel Seminyak
736,Holiday,20,July 2018,"Two far away from anything. If your disabled don’t go there. Pay as you use no bookings up to room. Would never stay here again. Staff very friendly. Paid reception $200 AUD to book drinks up to room, make sure you keep receipt as they lost my deposit.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
737,Nice Hotel with cheap price,40,August 2018,"I stay 1 night in this hotel & get cheap price. They also upgrading my room to a better class while check in. They also have a good bar with delicious food & drinks. My room at 4th floor with balcony, but i cant see the view to the pool, because there is a big coconut tree in front of my balcony. For breakfast, they have good food & a lot of variant tho choose. See u in next holiday",Primera Hotel Seminyak
738,Reasonable Hotel With A Reasonable Price,30,August 2018,"I chose Ramada Encore for my family trip consisting 6 adults and 2 kids as it offers the family room of the size 110 meter square with three rooms, two toilets, living room, kitchen area and spacious balcony facing the swimming pool. It is considerably huge. And the room provides water dispenser and kitchen utilities to cook. The price is considerably cheap for less than USD200 and on some occasion can even be cheaper than that (I missed it when I did my booking). And the breakfast is included for all adults. And the breakfast varieties was good enough. The downside, regarding my stay in this hotel is the cleanliness. I just don't feel that the room is clean. I am not sure it is because of the size of the room or the service issue. Because based on my experience, cleanliness is always an issue when it comes with big rooms (eg, villa). And some utilities are a bit old. Location is also an issue as it is quite deep inside, but not so much an issue. Overall it was ok to stay here for such a price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
739,A blast,50,August 2018,"Resort was perfect rooms clean and neat aircon nice and cold shower water pressure was good stayed there for 4 nights
if you wanna go to kuta they have Free shuttle buss or you can just park your rented bike at parking lot without payin any parking fee",Primera Hotel Seminyak
740,Couple Holiday,50,August 2018,"The hotel was very nice and homie.
The location is not at the main road, but just a 2 min. drive from the main road.
Planty of mini stores.
Just a 10 min. drive with motorcycle to the Seminyak and Lagian Beach.
We stayed and the Balcony Pool View.

The point is, very recomended for next visit!
I love it!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
741,Bali Holiday,40,July 2018,"This hotel is very good and clean, with a great pool and a great restaurant. Alk the staff were very helpful, but especially Ricky who was our waiter most nights.
It is only about a $5.00 cab ride to Seminyak or Kuta.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
742,Huge swimming pool,50,August 2018,"It was good experience for me and my family , they have a huge swimming pool and our kid are like it . The staff very helpful too, big parking area. and we will be back for sure!! Thank you for fabulous experience.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
743,Good but not a great location,40,August 2018,"Room was nice but not the cleanest. Tv had loads of great channels. Breakfast was average. Served nice food in their restaurant ( would recommend kung pao chicken, Indonesian curry and ny burger). The pool area was lovely. There happened to be an earthquake during our stay and the staff were very helpful. The location wasn't that convenient. It's about a 10 minute walk to an area of shops, cafes, laundromat. But it's a taxi ride away to seminyak or the sea front.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
744,Can't call to confirm booking,10,August 2018,"I booked a stay for 19-25 August and wanted to confirm my booking via telephone. Tried calling them several times but couldn't connect with them. Please fix this as soon as possible.

Saya menelepon berkali-kali untuk mengkonfirmasi pesanan hotel, tetapi tidak pernah terhubung. Saya berharap masalah ini diperbaiki secepat mungkin.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
745,Not your typical Ramada!,30,February 2018,"I would rate this place average as the location, the rooms, the service, the accessibility is just average. You may choose some other options instead as location becomes an important factor when you travel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
746,"Lovely Hotel, Very Friendly Staff!",40,July 2018,"This was our time in Bali and our first hotel out of the 5 different ones we stayed at. As soon as you arrive the staff are very smiley and welcoming! The open bar, dining and pool area is beautiful. There was always a lovely atmosphere with music in the background. Each night we returned to the hotel and sat at the bar and had a drink. The Buffet Breakfast was lovely, lots to choose from including pancakes, fruit, eggs any way, bacon, breads, pastries, cereals, juices and Indonesian dishes. We did have a light dinner here one night and it was very lovely traditional Indonesian food which was also very cheap. Alcoholic drinks were not too over priced and were reasonable. The Hotel overall was very nice, we felt very safe and well looked after and the rooms were very clean with a lovely walk in shower. The hotel had everything you needed, safe in the room, towels for the pool, gym, free shuttle service etc. I would say the hotel offered us way more than we expected for the cheap price we payed! The only downside is the location of the hotel... it is great because if you prefer the quiet areas you are out of the way of all the bars, clubs and restaurants however if you enjoy both you will need to order taxis to and from this hotel, although taxis were not very expensive. If this hotel was slightly more central to Seminyak square it would be perfect. However we did not mind the taxis and liked being slightly out the way from the hustle. For the very reasonable price we payed and the hospitality of the hotel we would definitely recommend and would stay here again!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
747,Good hotel but far,40,August 2018,"This hotel is clean and good. But it’s not close at all to kuta/Legian/seminyak(it will take -+30 mins). The spa was good,especially we can do couple massage. But room service(restaurant) is not really good, better to buy food from outside.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
748,Family vacation,50,August 2018,"This is our first visit to Ramada encore bali semiyak.when we first day of check in the staff all invite us with their smilling face.nice room it's really suit for a family and very comfortable.the view from balcony is very nice.i would like to say about the staff there Mrs tita she is really very good and friendly staff here.before two weeks i reach here I mail her bout my husband's surprise birthday celebration.she arrange for it in correct time and I really appreciate with the decoration of she did for my husband and my husband also surprised and impressed with the celebration.morning breakfast was delicious have a lot of variety can suit for youngster ,elderly people and also for kids.next visit we will back again to Ramada encore bali seminyak.thank you for all the Ramada encore bali staff.we enjoyed.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
749,Mixed reviews,30,August 2018,"Have given it a 3 based on what I am used to, but suppose compared to what is offered here it could be a 4. Friendly staff, our room was clean and lovely pool. Some quick fixes could make this place even better...like a welcome drink, staff serving to understand English a bit better, spa prices could be looked at, quality of tv signal in rooms, breakfast options and not having to wait so long for your egg omelette and have bacon as choice (not having to ask for it). Loved the COFFEE BAR...good quality cappuccino! Could look at not having smokers under the ‘roof’ section in the restaurant...or even better, no smokers at all!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
750,We were there 5 min and we decided this was a awful hotel,20,July 2018,"The hotel smelled, the balcony door did not shut all the way so you could hear the loud noises from pool and bugs could get in, the aircon did not work well. Overall, not a great hotel. You are better off paying a little bit more for better hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
751,Depends what you want,30,July 2018,"The best part of the hotel would be the service. Then the pool. It also has a great menu and spa selection, but they're twice the price compared to very good options 5-10 minute walk away. Or it's a 10-20 minute taxi to Seminyak, depending on traffic. The hotel offers free shuttles about 4-5 times a day, but book the day before to guarantee a spot. The morning slots get booked the quickest.
I didn't mind being farther away from Seminyak, because it was less hectic.
The worst part would be how thin the walls are.
I think I got my money's worth.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
752,very good hotel and friendly stuff,40,June 2018,"everything is good . except THE LOCATION of the hotel. you have to walk a long distance to the main road . and of course the hotel taxi is expensive and you cant order uber or grab taxi as they dont allow him to enter the street so you have to walk to the main road also to pick you up
I reserved a deluxe pool view room but what i got was a tree view room and very small view to the pool that was very annoying",Primera Hotel Seminyak
753,A 4-star Hotel but I would rate it 3 star!,30,July 2018,"I was staying with my family from 17th to 20th- Room No 2319/2320. Our Wi-fi wasn't working almost all of the time. the electricity got cut off and the bathroom tubelight just came off. Thankfully my little one was not in the washroom at that point of time. The swimming pool is right at the centre and the voice echoes so if you are looking for some quite place definitely this is not a good option.

The food is average. The vegetarian spread for breakfast is hardly anything.

The biggest challenge was to call a Grab taxi to the hotel. Many a times the guard shouted and did not allow the Grab taxis to enter the premises. If you book a taxi from the Hotel it would charge you twice the amount. Please download Grab app and check it for yourself.

The Hotel has definite arrangements with the local taxi drivers hence Grab taxis ask you to come to the main road that is approximately more than a km walk from the hotel. We got to know that Ramada Encore has been not allowing Grab for a long time and he Grab drivers have fallen into major problem because of the local taxi owners.

Please insist on calling Grab from the reception.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
754,"BED BUGS and dirty, stained bed linen.",10,July 2018,"All seemed fine but woke up covered in bite and with blood spots all over the sheets. On closer inspection, bed bugs. Removed the sheets on the bed to find a mattress topper covered in previous blood spots as well as what looked like years of semen, sweat and urine stains. Absolutely filthy. Will need to hot wash all my clothes and throw my suitcase out when I get home. Utterly revolting.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
755,Absolutely amazing,50,July 2018,"This hotel was outstanding. Awesome, attentive staff- very caring and helpful. Loved loved this hotel and we will surely be back. Great location, scooter hire etc. Well known to locals - easy to get to and from. Love!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
756,Mr,50,July 2018,"The service is brilliant and staffs are very humble . I enjoyed a lot while staying in this hotel . The hotel is having very nice atmosphere with Zym , swimming pool24 hours restaurant .One MUST refer this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
757,Good value for the money,40,July 2018,"The hotel is just good enough. You get what you pay for. The location is not the best and your forced to use their taxi service which can be pricey. Walking to places such as Sekiniak Square or the beach is a 25+ minutes.

The rooms and food are average and the staff is very friendly and kind.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
758,Great value for money!!,50,June 2018,"Stayed here for 6 nights during the last week of June. Got a decent deal and to top it off, they upgraded us to pool-side on simply one request at the time of check-in. Simple, elegant and clean room. Polite and ever smiling and helpful staff. Beautiful patio by the side of the pool to relax in the evening or morning. Big sumptuous breakfast spread. Only the location is slightly off the happening places but makes it calmer and taxis are easily available.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
759,"I had a great experience in Ramada encore,Seminyak!",50,June 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Ramada encore in seminyak. The rooms were clean and modern.
Most importantly, the staff were very friendly and attentive.
The breakfast is nice and there is a huge spread daily.

Ambience is great.The best part is the pool, they have a really huge pool with many sunbeds. We had a balcony overlooking the pool which was beautiful.The pool bar service is fantastic.

The location of the hotel is a bit off from the seminyak sqaure which is infact a good thing.They do offer a free shuttle a few times a day. Also, bikes and taxi's are easily available.

I had a great experience in Ramada encore,Seminyak!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
760,Great last leg,40,July 2018,"Stayed in the Ramada on the last leg of our Bali stay after arriving from An 8 hr journey from Gilli T check in was quick and efficient, we decided to eat tea in the hotel and I could not be more impressed with the food, price and service we received, our waiter for evening Eka who was absolutely outstanding. The pool area is quite impressive with lots of beds available, our room was spacious ,clean.
Due to the location you are away from the main hustle and bustle from Seminyak which was a bonus for us as we had already experienced it from the first part of our stay, the hotel offers a shuttle service to various points in Seminyak so you will be able to get to the beach , Kuta and shopping districts.
I have read some of the previous reviews and all’s I would say is that any review is subjective as some of the places we stayed had good and bad experiences for us but in all as a hotel this is great place to stay and relax in",Primera Hotel Seminyak
761,Stay Away,10,July 2018,"My friend and our 2 daughters came away for a special all girls trip. We had the most unpleasant stay here. The bedsheets weren't changed, the safe didn't work, the fridge didn't work, the hotel guests were so noisy and as the walls were paper- thin and you could hear everything, rock hard beds and pillows that were lumpy and look like they haven't been updated in 20 years. This is a property where all the locals stay, and unfortunately we were made to feel very uncomfortable if we weren't covered up. And it is WAY out of the popular Seminyak area. The shuttle provided is slow and much more expensive than the local taxis. However, you can't flag down a taxi when you walk out the door, as there are none around - this property is too far out and down small side streets. We ended up leaving and we lost all our money as the management DIDN'T care about us or any of our problems. ( They did replace the safe after the 5th time they came to the room). A VERY disappointing experience from start to finish.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
762,4 star experience.,40,June 2018,"Well , Ramada Encore is a 4 star experience with all modern facilities in the room and staff being extremely polite and always smiling. Swimming pool was the main reason i had booked this place as this property has 1 of the biggest pool with sun beds. Food was okay to my taste buds , but was reasonably priced. Drinks were quite good and again was reasonably priced. Place is bit off from seminyak sqaure , however bikes and taxi's are easily available. Use blue bird taxi's or just hire a bike on rent. Places can be covered with a short distance of 10 mins by car or by bike. Hotel is always crowded which i generally do not like. Breakfast was having many options and was having live counter for omelets and soups. Check in & check out was smooth too.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
763,Below average,10,May 2018,"Bed sheets wasn't changed every day, had to call reception countless times to have fresh towels delivered, shower was always only warm not hot and the best part was paying 370k baht for mothers day massage promotion and the masseur was playing her phone while massaging with other hand and still continued on the her phone after I seen her doing it. Also brought our own alcohol as bar expensive we took our own made drinks to sit in pool area with the kids and we were told to get rid of our drinks as we are not allowed to bring our own drinks to the hotel",Primera Hotel Seminyak
764,"Friendly staff, comfortable rooms",40,July 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at ramada encore in seminyak. The rooms were clean and modern enough. The staff were very friendly and attentive.
The breakfast is nice, however is scattered across the whole pool area so it's closed off during that time.
The pool is nice however all the sunbeds are in the water, would be nice if they were to the side.
We had a balcony overlooking the pool which was beautiful however very noisy.
The pool bar service is fantastic, the cocktail specials are good anns i tried a range of menu items that were all nice.
The fitness centre is good, spacious and air conditioned
The rooms are set up in a maze and it can be difficult to find your way around at times
The spa is a little pricey however one of the best massages I've had whilst in Bali. They offer great discounts if you go earlier in the day.
The location of the hotel is a bit of a letdown as its further from the town centre. They do offer a free shuttle a few times a day, but beware of taxis trying to rip you off.
Overall it was a nice stay!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
765,Great stay!,40,July 2018,"Hotel was Great! Staff are very friendly esp our Housekeeper Dipa who was friendly and approachable and left wonderful animals made out of towels.

Only thing is that it would be nice to advise guests that it is a bit out of the way in terms of walking access to most places. Other than that, this was a very enjoyable stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
766,"Very bad service, avoid it.",10,July 2018,"Rooms are nice, but service is very poor. Check in took more than 30 minutes as there was only one person at reception during peak hours. We ordered food and have to wait for over 1 hour and none of the staff cared to update or show care or apologise. Avoid staying here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
767,AVOID,10,June 2018,"There are so many more hotels to stay at for less money on Seminyak. Do not stay here, trust me!
I was given a room on the 5th floor that was okay besides the fact that every other room on this floor seemed to be occupied by staff using the rooms as staff areas. Dodgy with staff in and out all hours of the morning, doorbells ringing and doors chapping constantly, trolleys up and down middle of the night - as if the walls weren’t thin enough! I had a non smoking room however the Whole floor smelled like smoke due to the staff smoking.
I moved to a room on the third floor and the smell of mould and dust was over powering. Sheets stained of blood and smelled damp even after watching housekeeping change them. Floor dusty. Hairs everywhere. Furniture dirty. Bathroom crawling with ants. Toilet stained. Towels stained. Electricity kept cutting on and off.

Restaurant staff slow and only move fast when you’ve paid your bill. Waited over an hour for dinner.

Poor management, left 5 days early with 48 hours notice and was refused a refund. Cancellation policy states you will be charged for full amount due to “no show” which doesn’t make sense seeing as I showed up and wasn’t happy with my stay. No apologies. Terrible customer service with lack of information.

Pool is over run by screaming children which is understandable for the summer holidays but you most definitely can’t relax by the pool due to being splashed as the loungers lay in water next to the kids pool where they run back and forth.

Only good thing about this hotel is that the majority of the staff are lovely. Excluding management.

Would never return.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
768,Great for families,40,July 2018,"We stayed here twice - once at the beginning of our trip, and the second on the last night of our trip to Bali.

Service was excellent - staff was prompt, attended to anything we needed, and went beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable. The pool courtyard is perfect for families to swim and play around. Location isn't the best, a bit of a walk to the main road, but they've got shuttle busses to the towns. Also, being far from everything else helps make for a quiet stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
769,Best Experience in Bali,50,June 2018,"I’m really very happy for choosing this hotel for my honeymoon in Bali, they have a very lovely and kind staff specially the gust relations responsible called Tita she is very supportive and helped us a lot from the welcome gift in our room to arrange the day to day activities in very good places and providers and even in her days off she answered us and did what we want, and the breakfast was very good and have a variety and the pool have a wonderful view",Primera Hotel Seminyak
770,Cool place to chill,40,April 2018,"We had booked pool access rooms it was wonderful to chill and relax. Breakfast variety is good and restaurant food too is not too expensive for eat ins.

Hotel has drop facility at intervals for Kuta and Seminyak Square and they are free but book in advance.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
771,Amazing place to stay,50,June 2018,Very nice place to stay and above all i appreciate the warm hospitality from TITA.. thank you team ramada for awesome stay. Few more good things about this place !~ the food and the staff along with awesome pool.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
772,One of the best hotel in Bali,50,June 2018,This is probably the best place to stay in Bali. There are many reasons like amazing staff / amazing room and nice food options. Above all our host Tita took very good care of us and ensure our stay was awesome. I will recommend this place for everyone. And I appreciate the complete team of Ramada for such warm hospitality. Thank you!!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
773,Layback Vacation,50,June 2018,"I stayed at this property for 12 Days and it was an amazing experience - i stayed in the similar property before and this one stunt me when it comes to special promo (e.g. Drinks, Spa ect..)

The service in the Restaurant was amazing the waiters and Waitress were great, all of them were so humble (Special thank to Ricky for his warm welcome and hospitality).
The Bar team was outstanding ""We spent so many late night at the bar :).."" A special thank you to our Bartender Mr. Reja for his great cocktails, jokes and to bare our funny jokes while drinking ha ha ha ha....

This property is busy with loads of Family (Especially kids) - If you like to sleep all day and party all night or explore the island during the day, this is the perfect place to stay - if you like to relax at the pool and clear your mind, you might need to think twist before confirm your booking.

For someone who comes from the hospitality background, Ramada Encore Seminyak had exceeded my expectation. Big thank to the management team to give a free late C/O.

Constructive Comment: The shower in the bathroom needs an upgrade - The phone next to the toilet falls all the time, it above the towel rail and everytime you hang the towel it fall off - More variety of European and Indian cuisine on the menu - Manager cocktail, i didn't know who was the F&B Manager, Front Office Manager, HK Manager, Executive Chef, at such property it will be a great plus to introduce all the Manager at short event once or twist a week.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
774,Relaxing getaway for 2,40,June 2018,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful, amazing views of the pool from our balcony, clean rooms, amazing food and all staff are absolutely amazing and so helpful.

775,Family Vacation,40,June 2018,"Stayed here for a week. As I was checking in, I requested a last minute flowers to put into my Mothers room, the lady at the counter was very helpful and did everything we asked for. I forgot to ask for her name, but I did thank her again on my way out.

Workers in the resturant and all over the hotel were really friendly. Always greeting us with a BEAUTIFUL smile.

My favourite out of all is that I found a great coffee maker. He made my Latte spot on. But my last 2 days, he wasnt working. I wanted to give him a good word and thank him.

The negative thing I've got to say is that we requested a spare blanket 3 times and didnt recieve it. We gave up on the 3rd round. Also, we've put a deposit in to eat at the resturant, on the 4th day we asked the worker to put it on my room number, but she said that was not allowed and we needed to pay cash or card. I don't understand whats the propose of putting a deposit in since we couldn't even use it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The services and nature of hotel staff is superb. They all are too friendly and always ready to help. One must visit the hotel atleast once and enjoy the hospitality. Also the swimming is just mind blowing. 😊😊,Primera Hotel Seminyak
782,"Comfortable room, great food, fabulous pool",40,June 2018,"What a pleasant stay. Our room was very comfortable & clean. Exactly as pictured on the website. The resort was clean and tidy including a great breakfast. Great value for money day spa offer excellent daily deals.

Travelled with other couples and would recommend. Security point check into the resort make a first time traveller to Bali feel more at ease.

Little feed back for Ramada: Aussies love their sports! Staff wouldn't turn the TV channel over to AFL. Sports need to be available on the TV screens around the bar/dining area otherwise you have no choice but to go elsewhere to watch.

Rooms will need a refurbish in the near future.

Very friendly staff, keep up the great work!

Great week away and would recommend. Thanks Ramada Encore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
783,Nice place to stay!,40,June 2018,"Me and family spent 4 nights here..
the pool was huge.. the place was cozy.. strategic i may said.. the staffs were friendly.. not too expensive (worth the price). i will comeback here when i go to bali again! Thank you!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

785,Great Budget Hotel at Seminyak area,50,June 2018,"The hotel is big enough for the budget hotel. Nice swimming pool, nice room. The room also big and their location near the crowd area.
But the staff is not friendly enough, also the security is little bit rude.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
786,The buffet breakfast is dangerously good,50,June 2018,"We paid extra to have a pool access room, and I am very glad we did, it made our time there much more enjoyable.

The rooms are massive, and the beds are extremely comfortable. The pillows are fantastic, where did they get them?

The staff are all very welcoming and helpful, nothing was too much effort.

The hotel is down a few small streets which made it a very quiet and safe place to be, but does stop you from being able to walk anywhere quickly.

Make sure you include breakfast in your booking as it saves you a lot of money each day, but beware, you will eat a lot because the food was fantastic, I put on 4kg in a week lol",Primera Hotel Seminyak
787,Great staycation,50,June 2018,"Say no more... this place might be the best 4 stars around. Thanks to Mr. Febrian who makes booking flawless, and to mbak Dewi who relentlessly meet our demands in diningroom, or i may say diningpool. Boasting with hundreds rooms and tons of parking space, it feels at home whenever we stay here. Did i say the pool is marvellous? You must deep into it to believe. Buffet Breakfast is always excellent with variety of continental and asian. Psst.... ask the pork bacon at the egg section. How about booze? Oh yes...they have great selections with very low prices.
I'm done talking. Get your luggages here....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
788,Twins 18th Birthday vacation,50,June 2018,"Where to start rating this Fabulous Hotel, we have had the most memorable Holiday at The Ramada Encore and will return every time to say Hello. We booked the Deluxe Pool Access Rooms to celebrate our Twins 18th Birthday, from communicating via email with Chintia to Front Desk Staff Tita and Leonie serving a smile around the pool and Antarini in the morning/evenings in the dining area the experience was effortless. The staff go above and beyond to assist you in any way they can they are humble and so friendly. The facilities and amenities are super clean. The food fabulous, the cocktail specials (bang for buck) and the pool Wow it is Awesome, and don't forget a SPA Treatment while you are visiting. The hotel offers a shuttle bus to Seminyak as well as Khuta daily, and exchange rate for currency great. Thank you again for your Hospitality",Primera Hotel Seminyak
789,Great value hotel in bali,40,June 2018,"Stayed here with my family members and had a really good experience. Friendly staff, especially at the counter and baggage, really helped us a lot when booking transportation or giving advice and suggestions.

The room we all booked was the one with the balcony, we originally booked the cheapest room but didn't like the no balcony or window feature and decided to upgrade. Would recommend upgrading if you prefer a bigger space if not the cheapest rooms will suffice. Room was clean and made daily, they give shavers, water and soaps. WiFi connection throughout the hotel is a huge plus, even though there were some difficulties with connection at times.

Breakfast buffet was rather average but the restaurant food was pretty good, recommend the sandwiches, rendang and lasgna. Juices and cocktails are a must try here.

Overall a positive experience and will return to stay during my next try to Bali👍",Primera Hotel Seminyak
790,Nice with note,30,June 2018,"This hotel have a nice pool and dining area. The breakfast good, coffee love it. Room price good. Room nice and clean.
But if you request a dedicated space for parking for big bike (i am a motorcycle tourer) you must make a confirmation call before. It is so hard to talk with the manager if you need something urgently... and you will face the staff that cannot make any decission and might end up with hard arguing. hard to get online cab to pick up at the hotel.
Well for me i will not stay in this hotel anymore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
791,Perfect for Honeymooning,40,July 2017,"Ramada Encore is a great value-for-money hotel and is ideal for couples on honeymoon. The pool is refreshing with a bar on the bay. The room was elegant, clean and perfect for couples. You may have to pay a deposit at the time of checking in, which will be refunded depending on the services you avail. They accept IDR and USD. They also pack your breakfast if are on a picnic or an early tour. Do not miss trying the delicious cheese cake (from their room-service menu)",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Aliando the gardiner was fantastic. Knew magic tricks and taught the kids so they adored him, very friendly!
5 stars for Aliando!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
796,Value for money,40,May 2018,"Room is clean but bit small. Location is bit out of the market place, so less noise. Cab is available on call.Swimming pool is very big, clean and well located. There is play area for children as well. Foord is excellent and cheap for a hotel. Breakfast is excellent. Stuff is very helpfull.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
797,Bali Vacation,50,June 2018,"We had such a wonderful stay in Ramada Encore Seminyak! The hotel staff were amazing - very hospitable and have taken care of us very well! Special thanks to Tita from Guest Relations, who made this trip all the more special for us. The hotel had free shuttles to take the guests to Seminyak Square and Kuta daily, which is a great help for tourists and first timers like us. The hotel’s location is great to get around Seminyak and we truly had a great experience. We will definitely be back!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
798,Best hotel stay ever!,50,June 2018,"If you want a hotel that's quite and away from busy streets, got good rooms and a lagoon pool and has good staff. You found the one.

799,First leg of Bali Holiday,40,June 2018,"Thete is not much I can fault about this hotel!! Accomodation very good, staff very good mostly and food delightful however we were disappointed it was well away and we were advised not to walk the nearby streets after dark and this is what we love about Bali nut as the staff said that is what many people like about the location. This is a minor gripe as they cannot do anything about that and tje hotel was great.
Room staff were a little remiss as on a couple of accasions not enough towels left, not enough toiletries bit when reported was rectified very quickly.
Front staff wete very engaging, friendly amd helpful. Alway very attentative efficient.
Best for last the restaurant was first class with very good food and Cocktails 😊😊.
Brekkie was sensational with a great selection of beaut food that set us up for the day. Thanks to Julup I think her name is who introduced us to Noodle Soup for brekkie and made the best.
Also Ricky and Anand both very attentative and informative and both made us very comfortable at dinner time eacj evening.
All in all a very good hotel with very good staff just that minor gripe that I mentioned previously.
ps. Great pool too",Primera Hotel Seminyak
800,Awsome Logoon Pool !!!!!,40,June 2018,"Spacious rooms,clean and cozy interior. Bathroom is perfect clean with standard hotel amenities. Friendly staff and helpful. Lagoon pool is make our stay unforgettable,large lagoon pool and have balcony to enjoy beer in the evening its perfect choices to enjoy our weekend.
Ramada Encore Seminyak recommended for family time..",Primera Hotel Seminyak
801,Good hospitality,50,May 2018,The hospitality was very good from every staff especially housekeeping. If you are first time traveller ask the staff about the places to visit. Thanks Dipa( housekeeping attendent) for the very good service and for making the stay very worthwhile.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
802,"great hotel, but a bit ""remote""",40,May 2018,"This is a fantastic hotel with fantastic facilities, the staffs are very helpful, the food is good above average. However the hotel location is a bit far from activities' centers and too bad online taxis are not allowed to enter the region.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
803,Excellent stay once again,50,May 2018,"Facilities are great, huge swimming pool
And the staff are great.
My family and i have stayed here 5 times and can say that this place is a great place for familys the buffet breakfast is beautiful and has a huge variety to choose from,
Whilst on this stay we managed to meet a worker there who was such a delight my kids actually miss him and talk about how he had taught them magic tricks lol,
Everyday he would go out of his way to make us laugh and tell storys to us which would leave us in tears of laughter... Family room is great as it has 3 bedrooms and a large fridge,
if you ever stay there ask for aliando ali,
He certainly made out holiday that even better",Primera Hotel Seminyak
804,Need Extreme Improvement,10,May 2018,"I came early in the hotel. Check-in time is 3pm, which is ok and the registration procedure is done directly. I came back to the hotel at 3:15 pm to go into my room. The reception staff once again questioning me about my check-in and registration. After another 10 minutes, I got the room key and when to the room. Very disappointed! Entering the room, I can smell the mouldy scent and directly checked the room and found mould every where Also, a black mould which is Dangerous for a Human being. Especially me with allergies and lung problems. I directly call the staff, and demand a new room, then run out because I started having difficulties to breathe. I keep hearing that it was not mould but stains from paints on several places. Judge yourself seeing the image I attached. So after waiting for another 1hour, I get a new room upgrade and it was 5pm already. Even in the new room, I still can smell the mouldy scents. And yes, I saw yet again black mould on the painting. See the image below below.

Secondly:
The hotel area is not allowing online Taxi (Uber, GoCar or GoJek). There was incident in the past which involved someone got beaten up, and other go to jail. This is not right. As a guest, I find that the hotel limited my liberty on how I want to spend my holiday and money. A 10 minutes taxi drive to my friend’s house cost me Rp. 30.000 or more depends on the traffic, which is not much compare to Europe. But using GoJek or GoCar, it costs Rp. 5.000.

In hospitality business means that you take care that your guests are at ease and comfortable in every way during their stays.

Verdict: Never stay in this hotel. There are many better hotels in this price range.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
805,Great place to stay!,50,May 2018,Visited this place with my wife for her birthday. The hotel staff surprised us with a decorated room. The staff is courteous and helpful.

806,Friendly staff with good service,50,May 2018,"The hotel is beautiful with a lovely swimming pool. Pool access rooms are amazing, you can just open the door and jump into the pool. I would specially like to mention about the supportive and friendly staff they have. There is a beautiful lady named ‘Tita’ who helped me in arranging a surprise for my wife. Tita was always available to help even in odd hours of the day. I would like to thank her for the support. Much appreciated. #Tita",Primera Hotel Seminyak
807,Good breakfast item selection,50,May 2018,"My experience stay in 4 star hotel in Jakarta or Bali, Ramada is the best breakfast selection item. If I compare with others 4 star hotel they have a lot of selection breakfast item like 5 star hotel. I will come back again to this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
808,"Amazing hotel, pool & service",50,May 2018,"Beautiful hotel, service is amazing, food amazing, cheap cocktails, pool is beautiful. Not one single complaint about this hotel at all.

809,Mrs,40,May 2018,"Great hotel, staff are very friendly and always attentive to your needs. Day spa was great value with a 2hr massage treatment only costing $40. We stayed in a pool access room which was fantastic to be so close to the water. Happy hour was all day long with 2 for 1 cocktails and the restaurant menu has a good variety of well priced meals. The hotel location is a little isolated but with a $4 blue bird taxi ride you can get to Seminyak Square in around 10 minutes so you can’t really complain.
Would definitely stay here again",Primera Hotel Seminyak
810,Great value hotel!!,50,May 2018,"We stayed in a pool across room twin share & it has been fantastic. Room cleaned everyday with fresh towels, room service quick & efficient, pool area is a highlight for me. So big & tranquil.
Buffet breakfast has a lot of variety from western, Asian & European foods. Never had a bad meal when dining either.
2 for 1 cocktails all day were a great winner too.
Roughly a $3.50 Australian ride to seminyak centre or they offer a shuttle bus twice daily.
Would recommend this hotel for sure. Great stay thank you team & Tita",Primera Hotel Seminyak
811,Our first Bali trip,50,May 2018,"This was our first visit to Bali from South Africa and the delightful manageress Tita made sure our trip was extra special. She went out of her way to make us feel at home and welcome. This was a great place to stay at on the whole, the menu has a variety of foods with specials every day..

814,Great hospitality at the Ramada Encore Seminyak,50,May 2018,"It was an amazing experience to be at the Encore for my first visit to Bali.A diversity of people from all walks of life and a kaleidoscoop of ctcolours representing the countries of the universe.Having said that what showed out most was the welcome from the staff, the check in made so easy especially after the long journey from Africa,room and restaurant services were excellent, assisting in our tours without any hesitation and as for housekeeping on par.Furthermore, they were flexible on our check out due to our late flight. Keep up the great service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

They always go out of their way to put the customers needs first at any time of the day if I was not happy with something or needed something :)! They even made sure I got a morning wake up call at 12am and 6am whenever I needed to be up for my daily tours I enjoyed my stay and incredible spa treatments. Thank you :)!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
816,Amazing hospitality and facilities,50,May 2018,"Full marks for Ramada Encore Bali as we stayed there with family for 3 days. Spacious rooms with balcony, awesome pool and delicious breakfast.
Hats off to the relationship manager Tita as she made us comfortable and helped a lot in getting cab, arranging scooter. She is always available for any assistance, would love to visit again and stay only in Ramada Encore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
817,Comfy place,50,May 2018,"Quite, relax and nice place to stay in Bali even though the location is not really good. Overall I really enjoyed staying at the hotel. Good place to rest after exploring Bali. It's worth to stay at Ramada Encore!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
818,Not worth the hype,30,May 2018,"We stayed in Ramada Encore for 3 nights. It is certainly not worth the hype. We are vegetarians and non-alcoholic and hence this was not the place for us. They have only two vegetarian options in their menu.This place would be best for people who are looking for 24 hrs alcohol services and non vegetarian food. Also, when compared to other hotels we stayed in Bali, Ramada's room service and staff courtesy was poor. They sure kept the rooms clean but not a place with peace as there were many people drunk and making noise outside our room in the middle of the night. Pros: Location is such that there are many Vegan restaurants around and good Money Exchange places around.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
819,Good experience,50,May 2018,My friend and I stay for 5 days at Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak and overall we had good experience. The best part of the hotel was the pool area is beautiful. Staff is friendly. Absolutely will come back again^^,Primera Hotel Seminyak

Breakfast was great too..they change the menu everyday so i never get bored..

The pool was excellent

Thanks",Primera Hotel Seminyak
821,Great Stay,50,May 2018,The staff were easy to talk. If you have any requests and they can not grant thet deliver a positive response. The room for a 50 SGD price a night was pretty ok. Thry have basic ammenities. The pool view was great to relax. Food was good to for a brekky buffet at 8 USD.Its a little too far from the central but they offer free scheduled shuttle service.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
822,Great Hospitality by Darma!,50,May 2018,"It’s a good budget Hotel.
Has amazing pool. Staff is friendly. Sometimes it gets late to get services however people are good and friendly.
Darma from the room service is amazing and helpful. He is amazing!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
823,Fab staff!,40,May 2018,"All staff in the hotel are brilliant, friendly & helpful with whatever you need. Had a wonderful hot stone massage in the spa (around £20). The restaurant & pool food is a bit of a let down... not much choice, pretty bland, & as much as if you were to go out to a nice restaurant in Seminyak town. They also quite often have run out of things. The breakfast is a standard buffet selection... you have to ask for bacon which is no trouble, we just didn’t realise for a few days! The pool area is beautiful & quiet, no trouble getting a sun bed. Most days we’ve left the hotel & ordered a blue bird taxi via the app (3x less expensive than the hotel taxis & they’ll pick you up just outside the hotel.) The cocktails are pricey (for Bali) and seem to be mainly juice. However, there’s a mini fridge in the room if you’re desperate. House-keeping come everyday & everything has been clean & fresh for us. Fake balcony was a shame...it’s just a small window you’re not allowed to open looking out on to what could be a balcony. Wish this had been specified when booking. Our friends have a poolside room which is much nicer. I’d recommend paying the extra for one of those. Room service has been promp, although food is messily served & as bland as when ordering in the restaurant. Overall if you’re looking for a cheap holiday id recommend & the fabulous customer service & beautiful surroundings make up for the below average food & underwhelming room.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
824,Excellent Hospitality,50,April 2018,One of the Best Place and Best Hospitality from Hotel. Hotel Employee -Ms. Tita helped us alot in making our trip comfortable and Memorable. She helped us in arranging sightseeing places and guidance for each Location.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
825,Our 1st Anniversary,50,February 2018,"Its was one of our best stay in bali. We had best facility with the best price. It was our 1 wedding anniversary Mrs.Tita (our co-ordinator) and she made our stay worth and memorable.
One should surly visit this hotel. Its 10 min away from seminyak square. They also help you out with drop and pick. Best facility for side seen in budget.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
826,Poor Service,20,May 2018,"We booked a room with kitchen and balcony- the room was very good, however, extremely poor service. We checked-in at around 2am in the morning and the receptionist was rude and unwelcoming. Rather offering a seat or water, he took atleast 45 mins to give us the key. Horrible experience. Breakfast was good however when I asked the lady if I can have some fruits in my room as I am not well due to late night sleep etc, she refused bluntly. I requested for a coffee and they wouldn't let me go in my room unless I pay for the coffee. I informed them that I am not checking out and I am not carrying my wallet at breakfast table even though breakfast was included.

In short, horrible horrible service, if you only want to stay in the room your room and enjoy the pool then consider it as an option. You would definitely need a taxi to go anywhere. Too much traffic, will take more than 30 mins to go to the beach.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
827,Nice place,50,May 2018,Hotel premises quiet and calm. Stayed here and my family love it. Good honest staff. Restaurant by the pool has good ambience.Yummy breakfast. Friendly and helpfull staff. Absolutely will come back again,Primera Hotel Seminyak
828,Poorly situated,20,May 2018,"We booked 11 nights in a pool access room for 2 adults and 1 child including breakfast. Room was fine but not even an inch space between fold out bed and double bed so were very squashed in.
Pool lovely for kids so an extra star here!
Breakfast ok but no bacon or eggs (besides omelettes) ever made an appearance.
Our biggest disappointment was the location. Although it states a distance of 2.2kms to say Legian (for example) due to diabolical traffic the distance could take up to an hour, and walking was not an option. The hotel feels like it is in the middle of nowhere so there is no option of walking down the road for laundry, a meal or different restaurants.
Busloads of tourists arrived often and restaurant was very busy each morning.
You are reliant on taxis constantly so we spent the first half of the holiday either in cabs or waiting for them.
We left the hotel 5 nights early despite prepaying in full as it was worth it to go to a more convenient location (for us Legian) and not being jammed into a shoebox. I would not recommend this hotel if you want the true Bali experience.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
829,A perfect budget hotel,50,November 2017,"The room was nice, a bit small however better than expected with this rate, was clean and bathroom was good. Breakfast also was good.
Staff is professional and helpful.
The only downside is the hallways a bit dark and gloomy. Other than this this hotel offers a very good value for money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
830,Ruined our holiday... What a hole !!!!!!!,10,May 2018,"Do yourself a favour and do not stay here.
Room stunk so bad my partner could not sleep when we told them they blamed it on OUR wet pool clothes!!! The smell came from the air conditioning vent and was actually a dead rodent. Sheets were changed once and were stained. The pillows smelt absolutely awful.
Glasses, Plates and coffee mugs absolutely filthy every day at breakfast. Breakfast average and service average.
The only nice thing i’ll Say about this place is the day spa.

Will never stay here again even if they refunded my money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
831,Disappointed,30,April 2018,Beautiful resort but location was awful. Breakfast was really good but had to contend with smokers in the eating areas. The one thing that was most disappointing was the fact that the pool was closed at 8pm every day.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
832,Meghana patil & Rushikesh Bagal,50,April 2018,"We had great time in Ramada encore, Bali is one of the best place in earth, Our trip and tour was easy and awsm just because of Ramada manager TITA a sweet staff ..A good n young heart lady TITA, She helps a lot for spot visits and guided as simple as possible.

833,Overall good hotel,40,April 2018,"My friend and I rented an apartment for 18 days at Ramada Hotel and overall we had a good experience. The best part of the hotel was most definitely the excellent service we received from Ms Tita Pawestri, the guest relation agent of the hotel. She takes her work very seriously and was so helpful for my friend and I for our entire stay! Anything we asked for she did for us in the most polite and helpful way. This was truly appreciated and she really made the difference in the hotel and made us feel comfortable, hope to see her again!

Pros :
- Pool
- Gym (although very small)
- Staff

Cons :
- Have to buy something at the restaurant to play pool which is a really strange concept
- A little bit far + no Grab/Go-Jek allowed (only drop-offs)
- Food/beverages are overpriced",Primera Hotel Seminyak
834,Should replace the staffs,30,April 2018,"Pro:
-Mid-range budget hotel.
-very big swimming pool
-the food was quite cheap for a hotel.
-breakfast was awesome.

Cons:
-I have to wait for 3 hours to get a room because the room still being cleaned? Come on manager you should train more your housekeeping team. So many hotel guests waited at the lobby and angry at the front desk staff.
-Had a 8am flight and hotel breakfast served to public at 06.30am so I called room service about 5am. Called many times and no one answered. So I checked out with my toddler hungry that morning.
-No bell boy at the time we're checked out. Have to dragged our luggage on our own.
-When we were on a pool enjoying snacks and coffee, there was a worker cutting down the palm branches and it fell to the pool and the debris flews and drops on our foods.

BAD SERVICE HOTEL.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
835,Shambolic!,20,April 2018,"Check in is at 2, didnt get into our room till gone 3. Housekeeping is poor - didnt replace towels, shower gel etc. Room is rundown and the soundproofing is awful (expect to hear other peoples bedroom activities and shouting drunks in the corridor). Breakfast buffet is quite big yet mediocre quality (bacon is provided if you ask!!). Feels like there is a lack of management here - it felt like the reception staff had never worked in a hotel. I give 2 stars not 1 because the place is cheap as chips so you shouldnt expect much from it, and the majority of staff were nice, despite the failings of the hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
836,Amazing break,50,April 2018,"Changed to hear after not enjoying hotel in Ubud and was great ... Pool is great size no fighting over sun beds. Food had wide variety and was also great. Arrived early and couldn’t get in our room so they upgraded us for free. Good location can cab into seminyak for 30000rph with a blue bird taxi. Pool tables foozeball and various activities. Gym was great although quiet busy think could be bigger.
Wish I speant two weeks here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
837,Nice,40,February 2018,"The rooms could have been a little cleaner, wash the curtains and bed skirt at least once a week. I liked the location, I could actually walk into downtown Seminyak.

Very Happy Guest😁😁😁",Primera Hotel Seminyak
841,Staff Stole our property and tried to access our safe without us knowing,10,April 2018,"Hotel is tidy, clean and food ok not great but ok they have a fair selection, Rooms were neat not overly big but sufficient for what you require.However whilst we were there we had left an iphone x charging in our room and it was stolen.Hotel assisted with attending the police station but still no return of our phone, my husband thought it was in the car until he had spoken to me which is when I advised I left it in our room on charge. we were able to view CCTV which had shown two staff members had been in the room. the staff were questioned and denied any knowledge, stating they only change the bed and do the floors. The following day our safe had 'apparently been left open' and was locked with a different code when we got back to our room. First, it had a low battery and then we were told it had been left open. So I asked if they only clean the floor and do the bed, why are they looking in the wardrobe at the safe! Again, blank expressions. Thankfully nothing else was taken. At this point, I told the manager not to bother sending anyone else to our room to clean it or change towels etc. The following day we didn't answer the phone at about 7:15pm. A few minutes later a man arrived at the door with a bath mat and asked if he could change our bath mat. Thankfully we were in the room at this time, but it seemed very strange to attend a room just to change a bath mat when we had asked that no one attends to the room!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
842,Relaxed and Refreshed,50,April 2018,"having read some not great reviews I was worried about staying in this hotel. No need for worrying. The hotel was wonderful. The service was prompt and accommodating. The breakfast was epic and the chefs were more than happy to cater to the Aussie desire of Bacon!!! The head chef even came out for a chat and would happily tell you how to make any of the products on offer. Everything including the bread is made on site and you can tell by the freshness. The pool was in a great location and the depth of 1.2m throughout meant that you could walk around or swim whichever you desired. The location is set a little out of Seminyak but it is a very pleasant walk into Seminyak Square or even a nice 13km stroll to Kuta Square. If walking isn't your thing, the taxis are available from the hotel , either the hotel cars or you can ask them to call a Bluebird taxi for you. $3AUD into Seminyak and roughly $8 AUD into Kuta depending on the time of day. Not expensive by anyone's standards. The spa had a 40% off deal when we were staying there and it was definitely worth the visit, the girls were professional and very competent. The hotel rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. I can't fault the rooms or the cleanliness. My room boy Santika was efficient and welcoming. If there is one complaint about this hotel it would be the price of the local beers. $5.20 for a beer at the pool is a little steep in my book. Apart from this very tiny blemish, my 7 night stay was just what I needed and I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone who wanted to relax but still be able to mix it up in Seminyak and surrounds.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
843,"Lovely pool and restaurant, good for family and kiddos",50,April 2018,"Located near Seminyak area. Hotel premises quiet and calm. Stayed here and my family love it.

Just a few pounds/dollar trip into town and s free shuttle bus. (Advice: use Blue Bird taxi). The only minor criticism was that the WiFi keeps logging out after a few minutes activity but that’s my only criticism. Overall, highly recommended, you will not be disappointed,",Primera Hotel Seminyak

I am travel consultant from Travel.Life.Freedom in Mumbai, India. We booked Ramada for one of our client because it is most value for money branded hotel in Seminyak, Bali.

858,Not good enough,10,April 2018,"Absolutely shocking!!!
On arrival had to wait 3 hours for for check in, then I still had to ask if I could get my room and was told to wait longer.
Booked 2 ground floor apartments with breakfast included and only to receive 2 top floor apartments with no included breakfast.
House keeping is atrocious! Bedding not changed daily, bathrooms not replenished, tea and coffee not replenished daily and when asked for a sachet of coffee that I wanted for my breakfast I was told to wait for 2 hours.
Common gaming room area only allows 2 games only if you purchase food or drinks regardless of how much money we spent over past days
We were denied a 3rd game for our kids even though the common area was like a ghost town.
We decided to vacate 3 days early even though we paid in full in advance.
Unfortunately it reflects bad on some of the friendly staff, this is appalling service from a world wide major holiday provider.
Rethink before booking with this company",Primera Hotel Seminyak

861,Nice but ....,40,April 2018,"Just stayed at this beautiful hotel at Seminyak area in Bali on April.
The Ramada Encore Seminyak in Bali is very beautiful hotel, comfortable with cozy cafe pool view and very green with the trees.
A lot of visitor stayed here just to enjoy the hotel facility specially the pool, you can take sun bathing here, lunch, coffee or dinner.

I don’t give full rating about this hotel because the hotel location is not easy to reach on foot, quite far away. The surrounding just villas and exclusive spa, quite far to the convenience store.
The hotel is not suite for visitor who wants to go around such as bar or club, you need to order taxi or rent a motor bike.

With the location of this hotel that quite far away, remember don’t you ever order an online taxi such uber or use local apps to order taxi, unless the online taxi driver will get in BIG trouble.

I saw this morning at the hotel that a visitor trying to order an online taxi, when the car arrived, the concierge of the hotel knew that it was an online taxi and the visitor was not allowed to ride, although the driver already left the hotel, the concierge still trying to chase with motorbike.

For visitors just remember do not try order an online taxi in Bali, it’s just for the safety of the driver.

When arrive in Bali, just book a taxi from the taxi counter, don’t take taxi from someone who offer taxi to you because you will be charged unreasonable price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Yes it is in a very secluded area but to us that’s a plus as you can get a taxi very cheaply to anywhere you want to go then come back to the peace and quiet and beautiful pool and lovely helpful staff......we will be back",Primera Hotel Seminyak
865,Just ok,40,April 2018,"The hotel is in the middle of nowhere and if you dont have a scooter or car it is quite a distance to get anywhere.

Large rooms but tiny bathrooms and the rooms are quite dirty and tired. Lots of stains all over the walls and we moved rooms and each room was just as grubby.

Large pool but only gets sun at certain times of the day. The buffet breakfast was good.

The rooms need a spruce up as the walls are dirty and the cleaning of the rooms was often quite poor. Our friends room had the balcony rsil covered in bird droppings and staff either dont notice this or don't care.

In general the place was just ok for the price but there are far better options on the beach side of Sunset Road.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

-breakfast serves at buffet style and has good verity
-the hotel offer free shuttle bus to Seminyak(4 times a day) and Kuta beach(2 times a day). but you should reserved it in advance
- rooms were spacious and nice.
- bed is ok.
- free toiletries charges every day
- restaurant price are reasonable and food is deliciouse

We had a pool access room which was just perfect. we just walked out of our sliding door/llanding and stepped down into the pool It's a very big beautiful lagoon pool with sun lounges in the shallow water outside our room. Yes, its miles from anywhere but the hotel ran a free shuttle bus to Seminyak Square and Kuta. Very friendly, helpful staff who all spoke Engish (some better than others). Would definitely go again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
870,Seminyak April 2018,30,April 2018,"Staff are very friendly and helpful, but very slow at actioning anything such as food and drink orders, also not all speak English which becomes an issue especially when ordering taxi and food. We had a pool access room which was great but not exactly on the pool, we also asked to be in the same section 2 rooms however 1 was at the entry end and the other at the far end of the hotel, so request was not fulfilled. No issues with the rooms or food everything fine and needed nothing. However the hotel is situated off the main area so it was a bit far to walk anywhere with kids, so you were constantly getting a taxi, if that dosent bother you then that is fine. We did book and hop on the complimentary bus once! It took an hour to get to Kuta which is not that far away so it was very frustrating and we never got on there again. Breakfast was included and they had a wide variety of foods available. The one thing for me that i really didn't like and find quite rude, was that there were smokers everywhere, even at breakfast, so be aware there is no smoking designated areas they will light up next to you with no respect or concern for people eating food or non smokers. The pool was lovely and quite large, but could probably do with more lounges and bean bag floating chairs. I would stay again as it was relaxing and only a 10 min drive to the heart of Seminyak.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
871,Less then average,10,April 2018,"Far away from Seminyak street, you should take a taxi which costs around 30.000 Rupiah. The road connection to the hotel is not safe for ladies. Staff were friendly but it is not enough to talk positive about the hotel. Rooms are really small without balcony and there in nothing in the room. Only bad quality shampoon and that is all. Climate is working too noisy and bad and it makes you ill. Bed was not comfortable and the pillows colours are yellow instead of white. Swimming pool was dirty. Foods and drinks are bit dela and expensive. I can not recommend this hotel to anyone. Ramada should think about changing the name of this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

I would like to highlight that there was loud rap music (Eminem) being played with sensitive lyrics which could easily offend many guests/visitors. I am assuming the choice of music is controlled by the young male bar staff. My preference would be for more soothing background music especially during a lunchtime. Save the rap and heavy rock for the night time and parties.
Did enjoy our drinks however apart from the intrusive music.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

But unfortunately, i got a room with dirty floor, it's like there is a dirt sediment and i don't know why. I ask the room service to sweep and mop the floor twice, but the dirt still there.

The pool was amazing as well. Lagoon style with heaps of room to swim.

The location is a little bit far from everything but we just got taxis and a scooter which made it easy to get everywhere.

The staff alone here should get a 5 star. They were honestly amazing and went above and beyond for us. Thanks so much to all of you!! Thanks tita !!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
885,Fine,40,March 2018,"For the very reasonable price you pay for a room at this hotel, you get great value for money. You need to catch transport to get to anywhere, but that is fine. The hotel is at a standard you would expect. It is very nice, without being perfect. If you want everything perfect in terms of rooms amenities etc, then pay more money and stay elsewhere. But this is great value and very nice for the price",Primera Hotel Seminyak
886,Compare to room hotel amenities and service are good are good..🖒👏👌,40,March 2018,"Room was good but H.k service wasn't good, last two days H.k forgot to change towels, even i made complain once, then later we decide leave it next day during our check out day we took clean from H.k on hallway in the exchange of same dirty towel. But rest of things are good. Also they are well in 24 Hr security and food service . Also they are good in wel coming guest👌👍, it was too good compare to other countries hotel i was stayed. Breakfast and their service's are good they personally cooked fried rice without egg for us that was excellence👏..",Primera Hotel Seminyak
887,Saad Nafai,50,March 2018,"I have been in Bali for 15 days .Ramada Encore was my last 4th hotel and last 3nights in Bali..Actually I wish if I have stayed minimum 10days of my vacation in your hotel..I loved the view of my room balcony directly to the huge well designed pool ..the all dining restaurant has a big display for brkfst : live eggs station with minimum 2 chefs ,hot section which can satisfy vegetarians ,(cold section need to work on it : should have 2 differents cheese sliced not cubes some mortadelles..) bakery section has a lot of variety.. Waffles and pancakes live station ..the most big issue in that restaurant is the 3 coffee beans machines: ( normally if I have a coffee bean machine in my restaurant it should give a good espresso not an Americano or brewed coffee.!!? ) the machine is set up to give more water for the small granded quantity of beans..!!? Some guests they don't eat in the morning but they like to have a good espresso coffee ..I have had a small brief with the restaurant supervisor and shared with him my comments also about room services.where I would have appreciated that his manager who were present to attend me..!!
Please keep in mind that my stay was fantastic and the staff are just amazing and service oriented (some lake of language communication..) the service team in SPA are very professional as well as the therapists will not forget the HK team ..please transfer my gratitude to all .. Will visit you again definitely..

888,Hotel with Good Services,30,March 2018,"This is not the first time to stay here (4 times) and this is the 2nd review for Ramada. The location is not in the main road and far to the beach. The services still good. The staff hotel are very nice and friendly. Hotel still good but need routine maintenance especially for bathroom since the sealant at glass shower box is leak and the water flow to dry area. Access card twice invalid so have to swap the card. Thanks to Ms Yuni and Mr Pandu. They are very nice and helpfull handling the complain. One of lifts hotel under maintenance but there is no information in the lobby so we have to use stairs or we used another lift at the other side building. The TV program does not good quality picture. The picture not clear as fibre optic or satellite tv.
Breakfast good enough with pool view. Restaurant and Pool are big. Ms Dewi the staff in the restaurant is very friendly.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
889,Review,40,February 2018,We loved our stay at Ramada encore.located at quite place. we had initially booked only for 3 nights and then extended it for 2 more nights. Very warm welcome at the hotel.our room was also upgraded.rooms we're very clean. We had requested for fruit plates in the room as we would missing the breakfast. The staff there did oblige and had kept 2 fruit plates in the room. As we our vegetarians we had less options to eat in breakfast but the staff was so good that they freshly prepared some hot vegan food for us. The spa service is of average quality.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
890,Very poor quality Hotel,10,March 2018,"The rooms were not cleaned as you would normally expect, the towels and linen were not up to standard, the curtains were not clean. We had to pay for ice to be delivered to our room, no ice maker on the floors as in normal Hotels.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
891,"A tranquil place, friendly staff, recommended.",50,March 2018,"Ramada Encore is not surrounded by main roads and hotels so it's comparatively quite. The facilities are generally well-maintained. We used the swimming pool and experienced massage there. Services were very good. The only thing to pick on might be the lack of a changing room on the ground floor, but towels are provided if you want to swim.

The setting of the 24-hour bar and restaurant is something not to be missed. Facing the pool and bound by indigenous music, you can enjoy breakfast and happy hour there with a very refreshing mood.

Staff members speak good English and are very patient, which are commendable.

If you were looking for a standard hotel with a fair price, I would recommend Ramada Encore to you.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
892,Average Hotel,30,January 2018,"We stay there for business, quite closed to main road just need to walk 10 minute from sunset road, don't walk around in the night because there some bag butcher around there, I got that problem but luckily I can keep my bag safe but i got bit injured cos fall down, they are not afraid even I was with 2 man foreigner around me, just be carefull",Primera Hotel Seminyak
893,Money Grabbers - AVOID,10,February 2018,"CHECK IN: Checkin was quick and I as given my room within 20 Minutes.

ROOM: Room is pretty average, there is nothing worth mentioning as their deluxe room is like just a standard room in any other hotel.

BREAKFAST: I was travelling with my 6 years old and even though we mentioned it in our booking they charge 75K IDR extra per day for breakfast.

LOCATION & TAXIS: The hotel is at a location where UBER or any other online taxis are not allowed because of the TAXI MAFIA who scan every single car which is not a taxi and are located 100 meters outside the hotel and always access an application which tells them which cab is in the area. They also have a Rate card for Taxi fares. TAXI to the airport costs $200K IDR where normally it costs 45-50K IDR.

The price for the stay is just a BAIT - Beware!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
894,Relaxation you need,50,March 2018,I was pleased with the friendliness and hospitality of the people in the hotel. They always wear a smile on their faces. The rooms are clean and soooo posh! the ambiance was really a big factor that will make you feel more relax. Will definitely go back there!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
895,Great place to stay with excellent pool,50,March 2018,"I stayed in encore for 3 nights, Pool access room. Swimming Pool is main attraction of this property and well maintained, suggest must book pool access room only. ambience is very good at pool side restaurant. The only problem i had is 2 beds joined together as 1 bed for my room. Brekfast is good except as suggestion they should try adding few indian breakfast cusine. Drainage for my washroom was a bit slow. Location is good, very close to semniyak. Lobby taxi charge way more than normal blue bird taxi, please avoid. Also uber and grab are not allowed towards hotel due to monopoly of locals, so avoida coming by grab or uber. Rest i enjoyed my stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
896,Perfect Hotel for a Stay in Seminyak,50,February 2018,"It gives me great pleasure to write this review - Not enough is said when a hotel exceeds expectations !
Could not fault this hotel - We were pleased to be upgraded to a room next to the pool - Perfect for a morning swim - Must say the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in !
Staff so friendly - EVERY one smiled and said good morning ! My opinion of the Balinese whilst good before is now is off the scale !
Breakfast Buffet had everything we wanted - Western , Indonesian - Eggs cooked to your liking and to perfection
Shuttle bus to the centre - Seminyak and Kuta
Wonderful Stay - Cannot recommend more highly - Thank you Ramada Encore",Primera Hotel Seminyak
897,Amazing stay experience at Ramada Encore Seminyak,50,February 2018,"The stay at Ramada Encore, Seminyak, Bali was truly a great one.. the facilities are amazing, the rooms with kitchenette is the best part of the hotel.. In particular for Indian who are VEGAN - can self cook in the room. The rooms are very spacious and the balcony with pool view are simply awesome. For the break fast we requested the chef to prepare us some veg food and he made us some very delicious rice with veggies.. you will have fruits and chocos to munch on apart from these (FOR PURE VEGAN only)..overall a place surely recommended for stay.. its clam place and lovely environment around. Thanks to the TEAM RAMADA ENCORE to make our stay very comfortable and memorable.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

900,Good Food Quality and Breakfast Coffee,50,February 2018,Very good food quality for lunch / dinner. Remarkably best breakfast selection and the best coffee breakfast available at Bali. Enjoyed a good coffee while looking at the swimming pool on a beautiful weather.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
901,3 nights stay as a part of honeymoon,50,February 2018,"I stayed at Ramada encore from 23 to 26th feb'18 as a part of my Bali trip , I must say it is one of the finest properties in Seminyak , very peaceful. The rooms were really cozy , we got a free upgrade from the hotel along with a honeymoon cake and wishes from the staff especially "" TITA"". The breakfast was very extensive with lots of items to choose from, the staff was so polite and cheerful at all times. I will recommend this place for someone who really wanna have a peaceful time and relax in the poll",Primera Hotel Seminyak
902,Relaxing and rewarding getaway for solo traveller,50,February 2018,"6 nights in one spot might seem excessive to the adventurous traveller but for the weary or those happy to take advantage of the cheap private tours and taxis Seminyak and in particular the Ramada Encore are perfect. The staff were delightful, knowledgable and went out of their way to help make my stay both relaxing and rewarding. Other than a minor mishap with my laundry, which was painlessly resolved I cannot fault the service I received - 10 out of 10.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
903,A wonderful time.. cool staff,50,February 2018,"I spent 4 days in this hotel in Bali. had a great time.loved every moment. staff was cooperative, helpful. got a free room upgrade, had pool view from the room. very large swimming pool . enjoyed every bit. The served buffet breakfast was excellent",Primera Hotel Seminyak
904,Excellent place to stay with great staff,50,February 2018,"We recently stayed here for 2 weeks and our stay was great. Must mention how kind and friendly Dewie was along with all other staff in restaurant, Gita, Riski, Leonie, Sri. Always felt at home with the high level of service provided. Aliando the gardener was great and kept gardens well maintained and was always up for a chat to recommend places to go. Must mention Dipa from housekeeping as was very efficient and maintained a high level of cleaning in our room each day. Also thank you to all involved who arranged the decoration on our bed for our 8 year anniversary. Rinni for the great coffee every morning with breakfast was great. Just miss the theme nights that used to occur during previous stays. Highly recommend this place to anyone as it feels like my second home now.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
905,An awesome choice for your vacation!,50,February 2018,"I stayed at this place and it's definitely a great place to stay, you don't even have to leave the resort, there is a gym, spa and their restaurant serves really tasty food. On my next trip, I will definitely stay here for the whole duration of my trip. The staff are super friendly, they even remembered our name whenever they greeted me and my partner.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
906,A lovely base for exploring beautiful Bali,40,February 2018,"We booked this lovely hotel as our base for our 13 night stay. During this time we went on a 3 night trip to the Gily Islands, but kept our room at hotel as didn’t want to drag all our luggage. However, most guests tended to stay a few nights and then move on to different areas on the Island.

We also explored many other places during our stay which were very easily accessible. It makes sense to hire a driver for the day and schedule specific visits into a daily trip. We done this twice.

The facilities at the hotel were brilliant, the pool was amazing, gardens lush and pretty and the staff were very friendly, polite and accommodating and nothing was too much trouble for them. Our room was beautifully clean, fully equipped and very comfortable. Breakfast wasn’t included in our price but we chose to buy as and when we required. The hotel restaurant was good and offered a good menu selection to suit most guests and room service for restaurant food was readily available if required. English and European plug sockets in room were a bonus also!

The hotel location was slightly off the beaten track - so were most other places - but worked well for us. There is a scheduled courtesy shuttle service provided by the hotel which runs a couple of times a day into central areas and the official Bluebird taxis were very cheap. I would advise using the latter at all times and requesting hotel book for you when you are going out from there. You can hail Bluebird taxis on Street when returning to hotel or install an app on your phone to request yourselves, or ask restaurant/bar to order for you. This information was given to us by other holiday makers staying in the resort who had been advised regarding this at establishments where they were staying.

The thing we liked least about our stay was being hassled by other taxi firms when we were out, some of which are simulated to look like Bluebird (and some that quite possibly are not legit taxis at all) but are more expensive and trail the streets, hooting and stopping all the time and asking if we wanted a taxi when we so didn't.

Also to advise that our trip to airport for departure via Bluebird worked out to be very much cheaper than our transfer on arrival which was not Bluebird.

One final point regarding taxis was that on departure, 2 hotel guests were advised by hotel to pick up a shuttle service (not courtesy shuttle provided by hotel) to their next destination on island. They declined offer and requested a Bluebird taxi which took them to destination and worked out to be a sixth of the price quoted for shuttle. Something to bear in mind is that the price you are offered on desk initially may not be the best deal but I’m sure staff will negotiate if requested.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ramada Encore and were very pleased with our choice of hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
907,Australian Family Vacation,50,February 2018,"Ramada Encore, great family vacation spot, friendly customer service... food is fantastic... the Balinese people and there culture is a rewarding experience to be part of, I will be coming back here definitely. I’m so very pleased with the service and medical attention my son received while we were here and a special thank you to Giri and the Ramada management team, for being very caring and applying first Aid treatment... and organising medical services. I also enjoyed the daily conversations I had with Dipa during his room service visits....very lovely gentleman who goes above and beyond to ensure your room is fully stocked and super clean....
The Ramada Encore is truly a blessed location I will miss the friendly smiles and watching the workplace huddles... until next time Encore Ramada I will be planning my return visit.... thank you for everything.....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
908,Perfect place to relax,50,February 2018,"We stayed 5 days at the hotel, the staff were amazing. The food was great with lots of choices. Beds were comfortable. Air conditioning a necessity. Rooms were a little dated but ok. Quiet location. Great pool. Sun beds always available.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
909,Best place to stay in Seminyak,40,January 2018,"It was a wonderful stay at Ramada encore Seminyak. Good hostpitality, always smiling and helpful staff. The food was amazing. It was a great help especially for requesting veg food , the chef smilingly prepared for us everyday.

Tita at the reception was very friendly and guided us about local traveling and Balinese culuture. Thx Tita for helping us have a pleasant stay at Ramada .

We recommend travellers to stay at Ramada encore to have a pleasant stay and experience in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
910,Stay after cruise,30,February 2018,"This hotel was chosen by our tour operator.
We arrived late evening from our flight from Singapore, check in was a breeze.
Our room was 4205, 4th floor, we overlooked the back of the building so very quiet.
The room is in need of modernisation, in the bathroom were cracked tiles both on floor and ceiling, the towels were an off white colour, the main sleeping area was large, the bed was nice and comfortable.
Made up daily with fresh bottles of water daily (don't drink any tap water). Only had 2 coffee and 2 tea sachets per day, could have done with a couple more.
The buffet breakfast was great, with a large number of different nationalities they catered very well. Continental breakfast, cooked breakfast, noodles etc, apple juice, pineapple juice, iced tea, to name a few. The fresh bread was very tasty.
The evening meals were good value, we ate there every night, didn't feel the need to go out to other hotels. For pudding one night I ordered Banana fritters, when they arrived they were topped with cheese, (looked strange but tasted great)
The staff wore different clothes/styles every day. They were all very friendly and helpful.
The pool was excellent although I think a few more sun loungers would be better.
They do provide a shuttle service but we could never use it as it was fully booked all the time.
They had a Spa but didn't make use of it unfortunately.
I would go back there again should I return to Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
911,Loved iy,50,February 2018,"My husband and I were visiting Bali for the first time and spent 3 nights at the Ramada. We could not fault anything about our stay. The staff in particular were amazing. Everything single member of staff we came into contact with were super friendly, helpful and with big smiles on their faces. The hotel isn’t a little bit away from the main part of Seminyak but that didn’t bother us. We like to walk and would walk in the morning and use the very fairly priced taxis in the evening. There is a shuttle bus that takes you into Seminyak 4 times a day and twice to Kuta. I cannot comment on the restaurant as we didn’t eat in but it looked really good. When we return to Bali and would have no hesitation staying at The Encore Ramada",Primera Hotel Seminyak
912,It was nice and pleasant stay with Ramada.. Food and room service was very good.,40,February 2018,"Room ,Food, Service and hospitality of management everything was awesome there.. We like their concern that when we had a early morning flight,we were unable to have breakfast So they packed breakfast for us.
its bit inside but they have free shuttle facility to drop at Kuta and Seminyak square.

cons -Only they have poor internet connection in the room.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
913,Great stay,50,February 2018,"Great service from the whole crew, from front desk to restaurant. TCheck in process was a breeze, even as I showed up at 2AM. Room was clean and comfy. Feny at the front desk, Ngurah who helped me with my suitcase and the ladies that greeted us in the breakfast areas was super nice.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
914,Decent place to stay,40,February 2018,"So I traveled solo to Bali and stayed here for 3 days (not the best place to stay solo unless you plan on a relaxing pool side holiday)

I reached the hotel early and requested for a room to be given early if possible. They made me wait 4 hours and only for the room at 1.30 pm.

Facilities wise, it's got a spa which I tried. Took the 2 hour deal and was quite relaxing. Plus pints to the masseu as she had just the perfect pressure application and spent the right amount of time catering to each body part.

Their pool area is their plus point, beautiful setting and can spend a whole day here. Good food menu and the variety and taste is great.

Location is a bit towards the inside and definitely away from the beach, and no Uber/ grab is allowed to pick you up, so if you have transportation sorted, you'll be ok.

I wouldn't come back to stay here, would probably try something closer to the beach, and if I want a resort experience then I guess there are much better options out there",Primera Hotel Seminyak
915,Challenge Bali,40,February 2018,"This location was chosen by our tour operator it’s a little out of the way very quiet. Minus point a fair walk or quick taxi ride to main town if that’s want don’t stay there. It needs a bit of updating in the rooms and common areas,it’s pot luck if you have a room that overlooks the pool area agin if it’s what you want pay extra. We found the plus out weighs the minus. One could complain all day, that’s what some people do. The rooms were adequate and clean, few cobwebs and updating bedding and towels need to happen soon. There was no traffic noise and if you know Bali this is good. The breakfast is a buffet and considering the different nationals that stayed it was very good. More than enough unless you are a pig. Around the pool area and the dining room you can be served a good snack or evening meal. The cost is fair and we found plenty to eat as my wife is not an exotic eater. Drinks good price depending on what you need. The services around the hotel was on par to what you would get UK or better and cheaper. You can go to the town or the busy streets and get equal and cheaper choice is yours. Personally I hate being pestered as I walk down the road for massage, nails etc. There is an adequate gym used many times by me ideal to keep the pounds off. The rooms are cleaned daily and restock with water(don’t drink tap water). The staff are very helpful and they do try to please especially the rude customer which I have seen a few. Air conditioning noisy but effective. TV don’t watch but fox movies show some good ones. On the whole we would return again, it served its purpose.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
916,Very good value for money hotel.,50,February 2018,"All the staff at this hotel are very welcoming,friendly and attentive. Special mention to Tita at the front desk who was very accommodating and Dipa who kept our very comfortable room clean.
The pool is a top feature of the hotel and great to relax in or around. To those who moan about the location being away from the centre of Seminyak, we used the shuttle both to go into Kuta and Seminyak and to return used taxis at very little cost. We therefore did not find the location as being a problem.
The hotel arranged a very good Valentine Day meal for couples at a reasonable price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
917,Slow check in.,20,January 2018,"Arrived 5 PM room was not ready, no compensation except your normal welcome drink. Got room within 30 minutes, the room was not ready (no bathmat and NO PILLOW CASE) it's a crazy thing and the most important thing is APOLOGY is not their culture. Room facilities was fine, head shower spill water everywhere, towel quality was poor (yellowish). Breakfast was good, a lot of option, as soon as i entered restaurant for breakfast they pushed me to pay in advance, they so worried I’m just running away without paying (Crazy). Struggling to have late check-out till 4 PM, I need to explain what happened on check in and he only give me extension 2 hours. SPA staff refused to pass the umbrella and asked me to get own umbrella by asking hotel staff not staff from SPA. TAXI online can't enter, if you want to use TAXI online have to walk 3-5 minutes, rumor said Hotel Security work together with local transport to report if you use TAXI online (haven't clarify yet, CMIIW).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
918,Incredible stay with Ramada!,50,February 2018,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Ramada for 10 nights and had an incredible experience. The resort is lovely, the staff were fantastic, the food and drinks top notch. We cannot fault the place in the slightest for the entirety of our stay. Ramada Encore is situated about a 20min walk from Seminyak Square, which we found very easy to do each day, or a simple $3.50 AUD cab fare, which the staff organise for you with ease. There is also a free shuttle bus travelling into down multiple times a day. I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to any family and friends.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
919,Value for money.,40,February 2018,"Had a gr8 time here.. Everything was up to the mark. Comfortable stay, beautiful swimming pool, clean rooms, cooperative staffs, well maintained.

Only disappointment was the bathroom. Needs upgrade.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
920,Lousy and isolated,20,January 2018,The hotel did not live up to our expectations. Either water problems or pool out of order. Better places to stay in Bali. This should definately not be on your list. Policies are lousy and not tourist friendly. Holiday is definately to break routine.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
921,"Relaxing, but disappointing reseptionservice",30,February 2018,"Good rooms, very clean hotel, relaxing big pool and area, good breakfast and polite staff. All over- a great hotel. What pushed the rating down is the food in the restaurant, it is not very good, so this was a disappointing experience. Also, the service we experienced when we had to change room because of a very disturbing loud noice from the roof was not very good. We stayed there for 10 days and was very good customers, but still they made this seems like it was our problem, which caused us a lot of stress and extra packing. I dont´t think this was very good service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
922,Relaxing Holiday,50,February 2018,"Just got home from Seminyak staying at the Ramada Encore and it was a great place to stay and relax. The pool is lovely, I recommend getting a pool access room. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the hotel is very clean and they have a good restaurant although the prices are quite high, so definitely cheaper to eat out, but service is great.Our room attendant Dipa was very friendly and cleanliness was spot on thanks Dipa. The hotel is in a quiet area and taxis are required to go shopping or bar hopping $5 for taxis into Seminyak about 5 minutes worth paying for.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
923,"Friendly, couteous, professional,",40,February 2018,"Room is good, staff very polite and helpful. Bar could have been open longer time after 2AM, more help needed for booking trips i think can do more. Maybe could have stayed 1 night then found other place for more of a personal service, the hotel was very big, pool was the highlight for me, enjoyed that very much, plenty of sunbed to relax around the poolside and let yourself unwind. Reccoment this very much for few nights if your alone, grreat for family thing, if you want more pampering and bali style hotel head for other, non western, hotel, i found it very generic and western, i wish i choosen more Asian type of Hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
924,Quiet Hotel,40,February 2018,"The location of the hotel is a bit far inside. Access is small and stuck. But the hotel environment is very comfortable, the flagship is a clean pool in the middle of the hotel and equipped rooms that have a direct path to the pool. Cleanliness and service are excellent. the achievement to the rooms is a bit far too. Ordinary food, nothing special. But suitable for those who seek peace.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

I really hope you come up with flexible options. Overall the hotel is great , n you will enjoy your trip with this property if you rent out a car or a bike which is highly recommend, though there's one bike rental down there in that lane , they act pricey n cranky, but negotiate to around 50000 - 55000 rupaiah.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

930,Good hotel,40,November 2017,"We had a deluxe room however it didn't have a good view and you could not open the windows. The room and bathroom was clean but did not look as good as the pictures.
The hotel is pretty good in itself however the corridors/hallways are extremely dull. The staff were very kind, room service was even better, they were very fast and the food would arrive hot. The hotel is far from the beach so I would advise getting a taxi or a scooter. We hired a scooter for our entire stay. We also had a couples massage at their spa which was good, they always have special offers for the spa.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
931,Ramada-Encore without Core,30,February 2018,"Ramada encore is a nice hotel, as the brand name says however we had a weird experience during our trip!

While checkin we were told that hot water facility isn't working for next few days. On asking why, they couldn't explain much and surprisingly the lady at the reception couldn't give any alternative. Infact she ended up asking - do you want to continue stay or want to cancel booking ? Shocking !

However i took a stand and expressed meeting with the manager. It was a manager who changed the entire unfortunate experience into a memorial retreat for us !
She took cognisance of situation and immediately not just apologised but upgrades us to executive rooms with hot water facility intact! She ensured that we checkin smoothly and we are not left stranded.

932,Excellent property with excellent swimming pool,40,January 2018,I would say the hotel is really good and well maintained. Swimming pool is awesome. morning spreads are decent. during our stay the hot water was not available. hence they upgraded us to a better room. helpful staff,Primera Hotel Seminyak
933,Good hotel but need improvements,30,January 2018,"Best location very calm place, all the staffs here very polite and good service but product knowledge must improve they are not comfortable for any kind of basic question, looks like great place to relax but for my view staff knowledge must improve.
1. No one told me while check in that I need to deposit some amount of money to make my stay more relax and comfortable. I can’t sign under my room( where ever I go I need to carry money to pay for the bill) which made me disappointed.
2. Laundry good service but I would recommend to pack in a way that i can see the cloth without removing cover.
3. Overall I felt food and beverage service side need much improvement in terms of basic knowledge for staff. (if I consider as 4 star that is more important to develop)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
934,Great Hotel,50,January 2018,Staff was super friendly and helpful. Food was good. Rooms were nice and big. Pool is nice. Lots of foreigners here! Hire a driver and car or rent scooters as you will need go far for beaches and shopping.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
935,Pleasure HOTEL,50,January 2018,"We Stayed only 3 days in here, and at the second day, I have a great and comfortable moment. So we extend more day in here 2 days. We stayed about 5 days, and still cant get enough so extend more day.
So we stayed 6 days, from the first time arrived i only want stay 3 days, Because the comfortable, very nice and friendly staffs, and the breackfast so adorable. Its become 6 days in this hotel. Its Highly Recomended for someone looking adorable and pleasure hotel in bali.
Thank You RAMADA ENCORE BALI SEMINYAK",Primera Hotel Seminyak
936,Explore bali,50,January 2018,"We stayed three days in Ramada encore Bali and it was unforgettable, the hotel staffs are very very friendly and helpful, they provided free shuttle to city which is great, we had our meals in restaurant and it was nice , generally everything good and thanks to all staffs in Ramada encore",Primera Hotel Seminyak
937,Wonderful hotel and best service,50,January 2018,"I had been to Bali for a short trip in January 2018 and stayed at this hotel. The hotel is just a 5 minutes drive from the Seminyak beach, the rooms are very spacious and above all the pool view is amazing. The hotel staff over here are very polite and friendly. I would like to specially thank the Guest relations officer, Tita for all the wonderful arrangements for the trips and also for being proactive in making our stay memorable in Bali. When we checked in to the hotel we were surprised to see our bed fully decorated with roses and as the next day was my wife's Birthday so they went an extra mile to surprise my wife. When we came back from the sightseeing that day, our room was decorated will balloons and roses once again. Also a delicious chocolate cake was present in the room fridge. I would also like to thank Rudita, our room attendant for all these wonderful arrangements and working on the surprise planning with Tita. Thanks to Esa, the bellboy for being so polite and ever smiling. Overall we loved our stay at this hotel and would like to come back again in future.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
938,Still here,30,January 2018,"We arrived on the morning ( early hours of my husbands birthday) ok I didn’t contact the hotel prior but they quoted the date on our arrival.
The room is basic but we had 2 rooms 1 for a friend accompanying us from the UK. To be fair for the cost it is adequate. The pool is fantastic 😊
The restaurant is good but have to question the cocktail make up and the alcohol content for the cost 😳
The shuttle service to the town is quite spaced out so plenty of walking occurred and to be fair the road is a little dubious with smells etc. obviously out of the hotels remit.
The staff are all super friendly and cannot be faulted.
Personally due to location I would not book again. Due to inaccessibility to other restaurants and services. You are trapped once here so spend your money in their restaurant. 5 pm is the last free trip, one way.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
939,Lovely hotel but the most awful service I have ever had,30,January 2018,"My friend and I are currently staying at the Ramada Encore the room is very nice and the pool is great. The check in was farcical we were waiting for over an hour as they hadn’t prepared the rooms.
The service in the bar, restaurant and pool area is literally the most terrible service I have ever experienced, we are left waiting for ages whilst the vacant looking staff stare into space or chat amongst themselves. The prices are extortionate and they add on a 21% service charge which is particularly galling when considering just how awful the service is. Also they do not allow you to book an Uber from the hotel as surprise surprise they have their own taxi service. The trip to the airport through their service is 5 x the price of an Uber.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
940,3 night stay,50,January 2018,"Rooms clean amazing beds and pillows so comfortable hotel was clean check in easy
If you want to take the shuttle to kuta or seminyak square it must be booked we were turned down when we just showed up
Far away from beach but did have a great pool we had great pizza by the pool 2 for 1
Drink specials were good prices
Would stay again",Primera Hotel Seminyak
941,Stay away!,10,January 2018,"We stayed here for a week and despite trying our best to give management plenty of leeway, our experience at Ramada soured our first (and probably last) visit to Bali. Let's start with the positives. The pool is large and is a nice place to cool down after a hot day of activities. The other positive is that the beds are comfortable. Unfortunately from here it's all downhill. Beware, the location is remote and you can't reach any reasonable quality restaurants or shops via foot. The hotel does provide a free ""drop-off only"" shuttle bus to Seminyak Sqaure and Kuta which runs 4 times a day however there are only 15 seats available each time. This is grossly inadequate given the size of the hotel (300+ rooms according to a staff member we spoke to). Your only other option is to use the hotel's taxi service as they don't allow you to hail a local taxi from the hotel. This was really annoying as the hotel taxi charged an expensive fixed rate typically 3 times what the local metered taxi would charge. We tried walking to the main road to hail a taxi but this is a good 15 minutes walk and not really viable if you have young children or are elderly or need to do it at night because of the lack of street lighting.

There are hygiene concerns both in the rooms and at the restaurant. Our room had advanced mould on all the curtains and drapes. During the buffet breakfast, staff busily wipe the tables, benches and bainmaries with dirty rags and to our horror, we witnessed them using the same cloth to wipe the cutting boards used by guests for slicing bread for their toasts. I hate to imagine what happens in the kitchen behind closed doors.

The buffet breakfast is OK. Despite being called different names each day, the dishes are essentially the same each day and is monotonous after a week. A bit of variety would have been appreciated.

The ""fridge"" in the room is not a fridge by any stretch of the imagination. It barely cools despite being turned on to the maximum setting. Based on other comments, it's apparent that other guests have had the same experience. For a supposed ""4 star"" hotel this is poor.

There was some really heavy rain mid-way through our stay and the main (and only) road leading into the hotel was flooded. This was obviously not the hotel's fault and we were all stranded for almost an entire day without anyway of getting in and out until they were able to pump the water away. The hotel advised that they would shutdown the hotel's water supply until further notice for fear that the storm water would mix with the water supply located in the flooded basement. Given however that there is a distinct wet season each year, the hotel appears to be inadequately prepared for handling it. Luckily we hadn't booked any tours that day or had to catch a flight. Some guests weren't so lucky and we saw people wading through the waist-high water with suitcases hoisted above their heads. Although it wasn't widely announced to all guests, we requested and were given buckets of water for flushing the toilet and washing hands. When they did turn the water back on there was no hot water. It was still like this when we left 2 days later.

When we checked out we were advised that there was some ""stains"" on the bed linen and that we were allegedly already advised by the hotel housekeeping of this. Not true on both counts. We were extremely annoyed as they were obviously trying to make us pay for something that didn't occur. An apparent stunt that shows the short-sightedness and blatant money-grabbing mentality of the hotel management. They quietly backed-off when we reminded them that we were stranded in their hotel for an entire day without water and had been taking cold showers and yet had not made a complaint nor sought recompense. I am generally reluctant to make complaints but when there is so much mismanagement and lack of fairness I have been compelled to warn others.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
942,Staff should learn more about hospitality,10,January 2018,"Their plus point its only a large swimming pool. Other than i only see a negative point.
No greeting, got a room with still a rubbish from previous guest. Didn't get my room make up after i leave it until the evening, with a clean tidy room expectation when i come back to the room. But, well need to ask them to make up room, in the end. Meet few staffs in the corridor but they did not even say hi. Nor greetings. Their face looks so stressed. Rent a motorcycle and ask them to prepare it at 4pm. But well reception call me for 3rd times just at 3.15PM. And when i come down, she doesn't even know that i rent a motorcycle. Then she said. The motorcycle is not available anymore. Oh wow, i said 4PM then they ask me to going down just before 4. So funny. Make up room. They just clean the bed and leave the sofabed with mess pillow position. Definitely bad experiences and will not coming back for sure. Oh maybe because i am indonesian guest so i did not get any special greetings??",Primera Hotel Seminyak
943,Bad!,10,January 2018,"I’m very sorry to give such a bad report but I’ve not had such a bad experience.
We arrived at 1am. It took 30min to locate our booking and check us in.
Our room smelt so bad (like Tabacco and dirt) that it was almost too unbearable, room was dirty (human hair still on the ground and loads of dust) and run down (Level 5), no hot water and the toilet was broken, constantly running loudly.
We would have told the front desk and asked for changes but we just needed sleep.
We left by 7am.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
944,"Excellent hotel to stay at Seminyak, Bali",50,January 2018,"The hotel is located closed to the main road of Seminyak, Bali. The hotel staff members were just fantastic in their job.

The rooms of the hotels with pool view are well maintained. The hotel also have an Indian food menu for its Indian guests.

We strongly recommend this hotel to all the travellers who wish to stay at Seminyak, Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
945,Would rather give no stars,10,January 2018,"Would give 0 stars if I could.

Stay was brilliant until flooding occurred which we didn’t realise would happen during wet season. We were stuck in the resort until 1:30pm and only decided to leave due to the hotel cutting off all water to the bathrooms including the toilets.

We then got stuck out and unable to return to hotel or contact them. They refused to refund this night as we didn’t contact them - however unable to and couldn’t check out as all our personal belongings stuck in the room. We were more worried about finding somewhere to stay than calling the hotel as assumed they would understand the predicament of finding accommodation last minute - ended up sleeping on the tiles of a family members room elsewhere.

We were only able to get a refund for the 1 x remaining night. We were offered free transport to our next hotel which took 30 minutes to organise and when questioned how much longer realised they still hadn’t called anyone.

Would not stay - according to locals floods ALL the time. Not good enough when the toilets get cut off which is a huge environmental hazard and poses health risks for all.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
946,Excellent Service for Accommodation & Facilities,50,January 2018,"Our Room Stay, 2303,2304 & 2307 is was excellent . The good choice for our stay & location. Next trip, sure we will choose Ramada Encore Hotel. We love the swimming pool very huge. The staff Very friendly & helpful.

Service Hotel Front Office & concierge was excellent. 5 star for them. Thousand thanks for the Welcoming Drinks upon arrival.

Sure, i will recommended to friends to stay in Ramada Encore BALI.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
947,3days at Ramada,50,January 2018,"It was our first time in bali, and i wasnt sure where to stay. The ramada encore was a good choice. The hotel is very central to everything but not right on a main road. Staff were fantastic,especially Tita for being such a wonderful host.She was very welcoming and helped me in arranging a surprise to my husband.Rooms were clean and bed and pillows were great! Pool was lovely and we enjoyed the sumptuous breakfast well.The restaurant was fresh and nice.They play good music and we totally enjoyed our 3 night stay at Ramada ❤️🤗",Primera Hotel Seminyak
948,Okay for the price,30,December 2017,"I have mixed feeling about this hotel. First of all, I just want to question their policy of not allowing guests to request for even 1 extra towel without renting an extra bed. Seriously. The only way you can get one extra towel is for you to pay for an extra bed. In all of my travel experiences, this is the first time.
Second, the location is a bit of an inconvenience. You have to drive a bit to the inner roads of Seminyak, and quite far away from where the shops are in Seminyak. I honestly wouldn't mind the walk cause hey, we're in Bali. But what stopped me is the big signages ""Beware of Bag Snatchers"" plastered everywhere on the small streets leading to our hotel. Considering that I travel with two small kids, I'd rather not take the chance. The hotels do offer shuttle services to the shops in Seminyak and to Kuta though. But only for dropping you off, not taking you back, which another thing that confuses me. I mean...the shuttle is making the trip to those places several times a day anyway, which means they are making the trip back to the hotel anyway...why not take some guests back to the hotel while they're at it? Doesn't seem like an extra effort to me.
However...the hotel is really cheap, so...yeah. The pros are, friendly staff, clean room, huge pool, nice restaurant, cheap beer, reasonably priced breakfast buffet and room service options.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

It was nice to be in an air conditioned space with relaxing music and no hussle and bussle, unlike the massages on the street or beach. They were a good price too. Buy 1 get one free deal meant they only cost $15 per person. Recommended place to stay for families and couples.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
950,Great food with cozy room,40,January 2018,The location is good. quite but not far to the city. food was great and the breakfast was excellent. Check out needs bit time and the bell boy too slow for helping get the bags to taxi. Overall the room was great,Primera Hotel Seminyak

Room is clean and brand new and love the view from the balcony which is facing the pool. Breakfast is good and the spread is variety.
Somehow rather, Hotel should provide more multi adapters though. I have difficulties of charging my cell phone and each time I got to down to the reception and asked for the receptionist to assist.

The rest was perfect!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
957,Isolated hotel,30,December 2017,"Our friends arrived first and had to get into a massive disagreement with staff because they booked adjoining rooms but there were ""none available"". After much insistence they managed to ""find"" adjoining rooms. then we arrived about 11pm and we were not allowed to sit near the pool to have a drink because it was ""sleepy time"". So we had to sit at the bar, which was literally 3 metres away from where we wanted to sit. then in the morning at breakfast because there was a group of 13 of us (Parents with children), we pushed 2 tables together, which brought out the manager to tell us that it was not allowed because if we did that, then everyone else would want to do that too. Then my friends son had a nose bleed and they were CHARGED 100000 ($10) for laundry because they had to change the sheet !!!!!!! We accepted the hotels ""Eco"" friendly tips not to change our sheets and towels everyday during our stay, so clearly they were saving on laundry, but to then charge my friend for his poor boy having a nose bleed on the sheet.....it's just shameful Ramada Encore!!!! This review is as ridiculous as it sounds!! But its all true. the cocktails are watered down, the food not great, the staff not helpful. the rooms were smelly from mould, the curtains were black from mould, there was mould in the bathrooms, and the taxis from the hotel into wherever start at $10-20. My 23yr old daughter literally lost a sandal from her room??
How, just how does a sandal go missing??! One sandal not the pair??!! I've stayed in Bali before and this hotel was a huge disappointment.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

959,Amazing Stay,50,January 2018,"Located at the Seminiyak its a bit on the interior. The only modes of transportation from hotel is hotel taxi ( lot pricier) or walk down to main road (1 Km) for an Uber. Yes they do not allow Uber 7 Grab taxi pickup from Hotel. However they offer free shuttle to Seminiyak Square.
Miss Tita at reception is a wonderful lady always ready to help you out. Upon arrival she upgraded our room to a pool facing room & also during checkout she offered a complimentary extension in the checkout time to make us comfortable as we had an evening flight.
Hotel ambience was great though the rooms were a bit on the smaller size. Pool was huge and the highlight of the hotel.
Overall we had an amazing time at this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

961,Cat eating the pancakes @ the buffet table,10,December 2017,"We stayed here for 5 nights in December, staff are very friendly , no problem checking in , lobby and buffet Resto is okay, foods terrible, taste like 2/3 days old. Hotel is far from Seminyak Square, shuttle will drop guests off but will not pick up. The worst experience was when one morning we were going for our breakfast , a cat was on top of the buffet table eating the pancake , it was disgusting. The cat was in the restaurant the whole time we were there.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
962,Many Issues. Environmental Health Inspection Required... Salmonella,10,December 2017,"My partner and I stayed here from 29/12/17 - 03/01/18, and experienced really quite a rough time during our stay. The reasons are as follows:

- Towels in the hotel room were in poor condition - frayed and held dark stains.

- Location; as many other reviews have acknowledged, Taxis are required to transport guests pretty much anywhere due to the isolated nature of the property. Lack of storm/surface water infrastructure along the entrance road to the property means that this road floods significantly when there is rain, and therefore guests certainly cannot go anywhere by foot.

- Noise separation between rooms. We had Room No. 3306, which has an internal flank access door to the adjoining neighboring room. This would have been ideal for a family to be spread between these two rooms, however the considerable exchange of noise between rooms completely destroyed the amenity of the individual room.

- General amenity of the property. My mother called whilst I was there, and from her end of the phone, she actually thought that I was in a shopping mall (that's how loud the background noise tends to be). Generally, the hotel could be described as a junior aquatic centre with wrap-around second-rate accommodation (the property has a scheme whereby the pool is available to the public through the day, which generates significant levels of noise). This is NOT accommodation for a 'quiet and relaxing' vacation.

- Serious food safety concerns. As mentioned above, we arrived on the 29th and given the isolated location of the hotel, my partner and I resolved to eat ALL meals at this hotel as due to the traffic, it was a mission to get a taxi anywhere else and back again. On New Years day, I was struck by a serious illness which revealed all the generic signs of food poisoning. The final two nights in the hotel before flying back to Australia were a blur. Sunken on my side with my pants down on the patient bed, with my doctor carefully prying my rectum for signs of abnormalities, I had only one thought.... 'why did I go on holiday to Bali?' A stool sample and blood test confirmed Salmonella poisoning. The incubation onset of which occurred within the clear time-frame when I was 'ONLY' eating at this hotel.

Not only has this experience been physically traumatic, but has been even more punishing as I've had to take sick leave from work, putting my fellow colleagues and clients under substantial pressure.

Given the details listed above, I would not recommend this accommodation to anybody, and I will not be returning to Bali ever again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
963,Highly recommended,50,January 2018,"Hi everyone,
Me and my friend stayed here last week for new year’s. We had an amazing experience all together because of TITA. We adore her for the way we were welcomed and greeted throughout our stay. It has a peaceful view on the poolside also the breakfast buffet was good enough to start a day. Prompt and clean service with all smiling faces.
Couldn’t ask for more Tita, you really made our stay comfortable.
You guys can also try their shuttle service.
Highly recommended 👍🏻",Primera Hotel Seminyak
964,you get what you pay for !,20,December 2017,"we decided to go there for new years with our friends for 2 nights (GALA dinner was included in the price).... upon seeing the room prior to our booking, we noticed that the smell was very very bad. the humidity was horrible. we were told that the room would not smell this way when we would arrive...
so on the 30th we were told we had to wait for our room... Tita made sure we had our room at 2 but this was not the case... we waited until 3pm. never did we receive a welcome drink ... only the following day but that was because we had to ask for it. the rooms are small and not very clean... there is a water heater to make some coffee ....which is quite nice but they could provide more creamer and more coffee.... I had asked for 2 extra towels and they straight out told me no... i explained that we were 4 in the room ( 2 small children) and finally she said yes....
the dinner in the evening was alright... small portions and not too tasty.
the breakfast buffet was a real joke... tasted and looked like the prior evening leftovers... they harass you to pay upfront your iced coffee... i said once i am done with my breakfast I will pay. tissue is not provided on the table and when you ask for it they look at you as if you are asking for money...
anyways breakfast was not good at all and the service sucks !!
that day we were not lucky as it had rained all day... so we were stuck in the room with 2 kids... but that was ok, it was not the hotels fault.
the bed sheets and pillows smell awful... the humidity is horrendous !! i was unable to sleep with the pillow... but if you look at the curtains.. you can see the mildew and how awful it was !
NOW... the dinner... what a deception... it was called a gala dinner but it was ridiculous ! same setting as the morning buffet.... look again like leftovers... there was nothing GALA about this dinner. tasteless and really bad ! the desserts... ?? there were only 3 choices for the desserts ! and no ice cream for the kids !! no i am sorry... my husband and even my friends were disappointed... the next day breakfast was the same and the desserts from new years eve were there at the exact same place....
We were told by TITA to make a review in order for us to get a good price... I hesitated a lot before doing so, but i did it giving a 5 star (with my original account)... NEVER EVER write a review before going to a place !
what is the point of even writing all of this as I have noticed in the past, these hotels do not care about what their guests write... they will pass it on the their management bla bla bla bla bla !! I am one to complain about a few things but for this time I just let it go because the price was quite cheap and we were there to have a good time on new years eve... they could do so much better... i do not recommend this hotel at all ! a disappointed !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
965,"Never stay at Hotel if with Family , Worst Location & Services Even threatning to family",10,January 2018,"After great stay at Mahagiri Resort we came to Ramada but from the start from check-in to entire stay worst ever experiences , details as follow for clear picture for anyone considering for stay with family :
1) Check-In : Worst way of check-In , even waited till 4pm to get room ,hence have to leave luggage and go out to city for time being , which is off beat and expensive every time from Bali standard .
2) Location : Worst possible location as have to take Taxi everytime you have to anywhere and also you are at hands of Hotel staff for taxi either their own which is super expensive they will charge you 200000IDR which normal taxi will charge 50000IDR , Grab /Uber not allowed for pickup & hotel staff even will threaten you directly & rudely be aware of specific bouncer kind guy Oga who is main incharge for their own taxi.
3) Taxi Booking : They do both their own booking (which should be No ) & Blue Bird Meter taxi which is ok but due to location its always expensive according to Bali standard plus again that staff at hotel entrance are aggressive & we could take fight if you don't want to use their taxi.
4) Breakfast : Bad as too many customers and less staff to handle that plus choice is extremely bad tried different time from 8am to 10am but same story and would not recommend for family to struggle from start of the day.
5) House keeping : Daily cleaning is bad & everytime you reach back hotel after day of activities you will find no towel , no soap/Shampoo etc & you have to almost call everyday for basic things , too tiring as staff is rude & we actually bought own soap & Shampoo from market to avoid these daily shortcomings.
6) Management Response : No one cares when you escalate on phone in hotel & no way to contact higher authorities as they always are not there as per reception & room service staff , tried several time and looks like mails are only way to contact them which I don't tried as too busy with own busy schedule.
7) Food at hotel is ok & can be considered
8) New Year night dinner & snacks just rip off as entire plan went to worse there & should have booked other good parties which we actually did after 10Pm as it was real bad.
9) Only one employee named Devi was considerate enough to give advice but nothing improved from hotel.

Overall worst place for family & don't expect anything for good stay",Primera Hotel Seminyak
966,Tita is the Best,50,January 2018,"Hi,
We were initially skeptical about booking a hotel in Bali as we wanted a private villa but everything was booked because of New Years. But it turned out to be the best decision we made. We were assisted by Tita during our stay. She is probably one of the most helpful person I came across in Bali. The entire staff was very good. They are all on their toes through out the day. The service is excellent.
It's a much recommended place to stay in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
967,Good,40,January 2018,"I stayed here for nearly two weeks on my own. I've seen two rooms as I upgraded as I really wanted a balcony. Both rooms were nice and clean, beds are super comfy! It is a little walk from town of Seminyak, but there is a shuttle 4/5times a day so it was easy to nip in, hang out then jump in a cab home. I actually preferred it being a bit further out as it was quiet and so much cheaper than staying in one of the four stars by the beach.
I found the staff pleasant, I haven't eaten here much, but it's okay, cheapish resort food, just as expected.
I have enjoyed my stay here especially as the pool is lovely.
There are staff selling trips on the front door, haggle with them. I got 30,000 off one trip.
If you are coming away to get pissed in the trendy bars don't come, but if you are a family/couple or solo and want to relax/pop into town/swim do day trips then stay here for a good price.
The wifi has been good, but not good enough to watch Netflix unfortunately !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
968,Stay :(:(,20,January 2018,"Very nice swimming pool but it is only highlighting thing about this resort. Decent breakfast..Standard rooms are at average standards. No proper response from reception/ house keeping & poor room service (short of people). Out of all, you will be literally robbed by their own taxi service (Be care full about the staffs at front who recommends such taxi's) .. must cheaper local taxi (Blue Bird) is not allowed take pick up from hotel.. Not close any of the Bars/ Mc D/ shops etc...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
969,"Room smelt, we checked out early",10,January 2018,"We were there for 2/3 nights but had to check out early as the smell was too much. Very run down room.

The food was ok but the staff were incredible slow until it came time to pay and they then moved like lightening!

No other rooms available. No offer in price reduction when we checked out early.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
970,Nice stay,40,January 2018,"When we are in Bali usually not spent much time at the hotel. So we choose this hotel because it has good room, reasonable rate and beautiful lagoon pool.
The room not elaborate, just standart in everything.. but good enough for 4 star resort hotel.
The service is good but seems short of hands at the peak hour.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
971,1 Night Stay,40,December 2017,"Stayed for just 1 night before leaving on an night flight so didn't experience the hotel fully, however the pool area was lovely and the family room we stayed in was really big and much better than we expected. Food in the restaurant/pool was okay although service wasn't very good. Location not great as not close to any shops - have to get a shuttle bus or taxi.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
972,Great Family Resort,40,January 2018,Although is it away from all the main bars and restaurants this was a great resort. 15 minute walk from main Seminyak strip. Perfect for families and couples. Staff were great. Do be careful of the staff at front trying to rip you off with inflated taxi fares.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
973,Noisey,40,December 2017,This place is friendly but very noisey at night. Breakfast is medioaker I think. Hot water well is like warm. Sink getting blocked and to top it off the fridge isn't cold enough for drinks. No hotel transfers to or from airport.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
974,Just great,50,December 2017,"This is my second or third visit at this hotel. Everything just great. All the staff and services were great.
Breakfast was nice, room’s clean, reception’s staff was really great

Will be back to this hotel again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
975,Nice resort but nothing around,30,December 2017,Was a nice place to stay the staff were amazing as was the pool very out of the way though had to have a driver/ taxi everywhere you wanted to go😬there was a shuttle to Seminyak and Kuta every day but no return shuttle so you had to pay a taxi to get back just found it a bit to far from everything,Primera Hotel Seminyak
976,"A Little Bit DOWN, but still OK",30,August 2017,"Was an excellent experiance stay at Ramada Encore in early year they opened,
* Bed and pillow are comfy
* breakfast had a lot of variety
* relax in balcony at night was nice (on weekdays was quite)
* wifi quite fast

came back again this year, "" a little bit DOWN, but still OK""
* Bed and pillow, expecially pillow "" LIMP""
* breakfast still had a lot of variety
* balcony still nice
* wifi not as fast as they used to be

what happend to water in the pool ? chlorine was massive",Primera Hotel Seminyak
977,A Great Bali Base,40,December 2017,"First impressions - thought it was a little rough around the edges and our room did not have a balcony that we expected, HOWEVER the staff were more than happy to move us to a pool view room which we had been expecting. Staff were so polite and helpful, thank you.

We suffered with rain and more rain during our stay, but a nice little spa close by helped ease the pain of the rain.

The large pool and gym meant there was no excuse to avoid a little exercise whilst away on holiday. This was helped by the fact that breakfast was a great start to each day. The usual stations were available with a mix of Asian and European options. Ask for the bacon if you need some to accompany your omelette!

In summary, rooms were a good size (once we moved), pool, breakfast and gym all great. We also made good use of the shuttle bus (although heavy traffic going on to Kuta meant a few wasted hours ... clearly not the hotel’s fault). On reflection we wish we had spent a few more nights going in to Seminyak.

Thank you for a lovely stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
978,Worst service and experience,10,December 2017,"I booked this room for 7 days and had a worst experience with them including lifts not working, no one picks up the phone, frequent ac problems, they don’t change the menu for the breakfast. And the major and the important one was that the location was terrible for the hotel and they don’t allow uber and grab inside the premises and there own taxi is way too expensive. On the way to the hotel at various places warning posted “beware of snatching”. Have never expected with a brand like Ramada.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
979,Excellent hotel with extra romantic environment,50,November 2017,Really a gud decision to choose Encore Ramada for our honeymoon visit. I am overwhelmed with the response from the management and a surprise cake arranged for us. Special thanks to magmnt and ofcourse Tita for making our stay comfortable to the highest.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
980,Great for Short Stays!,40,June 2017,"The past week spent Bali was quite a blur and never long enough. Some notes as follows from the hotels we got to stay at and visit:

Ramada Encore Seminyak.
Hotel location quite deep and away from 'Seminyak' but close to the mainstreet of Sunset Road and thus fairly easy to get to anywhere. The road to the hotel is across from Jl Kunti that does provide a number of decent restaurants like Taco Grill and the neat little Bali Deli supermarket.

Layout of the hotel was cosy with a small lounge area as well as a pool table and Foosball table to while away the hours. Just to the side of the Reception are the Hotel Restaurant overlooking the lagoon type pools. Certainly cleverly designed to be a type of oasis within this unique compound.

As we got into the rooms, we were pleasantly surprised that they were quite sizeable and that main King size bed was a good decent size, pillows were awesome and super comfortable. There was even a long lounge chair which could serve as a adventurous temporary bed for any of the young-uns, so the hotel is clearly catered to families as you dont have a need to pay for an extra bed. Bit of a shame that we only got to stay for a night as we arrived late in the afternoon and had to leave the next day.

Unfortunately for us, while the room was delightful, we were actually positioned right above the bar and during the night there was also a loud 'gong' noise due to the water pump being right near our room, so wifey didnt sleep too well. After a tiring day traveling, the relaxing evening swim and a few games of Foosball with the boys, I slept like a baby. 😅😂

Breakfast was standard, nothing above average, its (relatively) quite expensive to pay ala carte, considering the offering (at time of writing about Rp150,000/pax and Rp75,000 for children below 12, and they only provide 2 Breakfast per room, but of course the hotel itself is tucked quite deep within what seemed to have been a housing estate, so obviously a 'monopolistic' rate would be expected.

The other good point the hotel does have is the decent pool along with the lounge chairs where you can get a tan from Balis hot sun but dip your feet in the cool waters.

All around the service with a smile (and willingness to help) was evident and I'd definitely try this hotel again for a longer stay there, but even for our short-short stay it was just great.

Thanks Ramada Encore Seminyak!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
981,Honeymoon Visit,50,December 2017,Very good resort. The service is good.Great variety in breakfast. Perfect place for a holiday. My wife and me had a blast. The pool is very good.Very comfortable.Outstanding service in the restaurant. Very prompt room service also.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
982,Lovely Pool,40,December 2017,"Thanks for upgrading us to higher room category on the 2nd floor with pool view. Breakfast score in my opinion is 7 out of 10. I would prefer to have warm pancakes/waffle and bacon, couldn't find it... ;) beside that, the hotel missed my request for giving a little birthday surprise for my husband upon breakfast. But overall we had a great time especially at the pool...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
983,Best experience ever with ramada,50,December 2017,Me nd my wife had wonderfull experience with hotel environment nd staff support. All hotel staff were really supportive and helpful all the time with great food and ambience experience.

986,Amazing property,40,November 2017,"We stayed in the pool access rooms. it was the best thing to do if you are travelling with a kid. All the parents will agree with me. there is a lot of dip in the pool ..come out of the pool ...and repeat.

The hotel has all the amenities and they really take care of their guests. We had an extended stay there because our flights got cancelled(Thanks to Mt. AgunG!!) but it was really really nice!!

I have taken away one star away from this property only because it is a little far away from the main street and doesn't have a great connectivity .",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The room was big, clean and comfortable.
All the staff from the reception to the housekeeping were really friendly and helpfull (keep it up guys)

Thank you very much :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
988,Peacefull days,40,December 2017,"We stayed 7-11 dec'17. it was great to be there. I'm not choose the wrong place where i have to spent my short holiday.

I decided Ramada Encore Seminyak first due to the location, must be quiet area, not so much hear the machine transportation. its perfect for both of Us. I got great room with the pool view on the 3rd floor, i have my own balcony and relax in the sofa to enjoy the morning. The bedroom with the comfy bed its perfect and for sure I have the clean bathroom for daily. The pool is big enough, love it.They have friendly staff. To make you stay more easy there they provide some shuttle schedule to seminyak and kuta and its helpfull.

I have a little problem with the AC on the first day we arrived not so cold, after i reported i got fast response and they trying to make it better.The good one also until the second day they still check the AC even it is already fine, its sounds like they have to make sure that you will have the perfect stay there.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
989,Best Stay for Honeymoon,50,December 2017,"I stayed in this hotel from 6/12 - 9/12 and I really love it! The room is nice and clean with romantic honeymoon decoration for me and husband. Thank you so much!

990,Poor service,20,December 2017,"I visited for one week and stayed at Ramada
For 4 nights. I knew location was remote but I had scooter so could get around.
Service at restaurant and bar was terrible you had to wait forever to get served.
They have a package for outside guests to visit and use the pool, so heaps of screaming kids in the pool and they get treated better then paying hotel guests. Got asked to move from a sunbed because outside guests only coming to use swimming pool were going to use sun beds , couldn’t believe I was asked to move. I asked what about hotel guests is there a reserved area for them , the waitress said no. Guests that had come for the day were treated better then hotel guests and served quicker then paying guests!
On the upside the massages are great!
Wouldn’t stay again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
991,Great place to stay.,40,December 2017,"This place is very family oriented and the staff are very friendly. I love the fact that access into the pool was very easy compared to other places I have stayed at. The rooms are lovely but at times the hot water wasn’t very hot. The meals in the restaurant are delicious and very affordable.
I would highly recommend this place for anyone to stay at.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
992,Good properties average staff,30,December 2017,"We were here on Dec 9-10.
Only one night.

The properties is very good
Room is clean
Pool is big and nice

When we check in, the receptionist who handle us was good.
In the afternoon, when we go to the pool, the staff where we ask for the towel is a little bit not good.
We ask for the towel, he asks us back to go to the receptionist for getting pool card which we don’t want to do it because we are in house guest. Logically we can use hotel pool.
Also, after more than 30 mins swim the staff come to us and tell my husband “excuse me, it’s not allowed to use shirt for swimming” when we try to answer, he’s LEAVING just like that.

Last,
When we check out,
The receptionist (woman), asking about the pool card but when we try to explain that we don’t have it (as we refuses that day to go to the receptionist) she said “you should have it (pasti ada pak)” and then before my husband answer I said “no we dont have it. Because we don’t want to get it from the receptionist”
why don’t she checks first to the pool staff? Why she insists that we have the pool card without check it first? Why she has no manner to local like us?

Advice:
When the guest check in, better the receptionist give the pool card directly. Because NOT ALL guest understand that we should get the pool card before use the swimming pool.

Thank you

During the day you can chill by the massive poolside, or in your heavily AC'd rooms while room service bring you drinks :P...or if you wish to go out somewhere the staff are incredibly helpful with information or organizing transportation.

The pillows stunk like mould, there was mould covering the curtains, I stayed 9 days and the bed linen wasn't changed, only made up!
The pillows were changed but quickly became musty.
The alcohol is fake but charged at high prices throughout Bali, I once paid $28.50 for a single shot of vodka with a .90c can of lemonade!
If you drink the terribly flavoured Bintang you are up for a cheap beer $2.50 but yuk seriously!
It's a bogans paradise without a doubt!
Get your tattoo and have a bintang haha
The north and northeast are worth a visit and great views of rainforest and cool Villas on beaches etc, and the people are much friendlier.

Good luck.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1000,Best hotel to stay in Bali,50,November 2017,"The facilities are superb, but given the hotel is quite large you may expect that. The pool area is lovely and the staff are friendly and attentive. Their in-house restaurant is excellent. I found the pool well equipped and well maintained. The breakfast is faultless, really, offering a plethora of options and all very well executed.

We got whatever we wanted and much more. Special thanks to Ms.Tita, she has been very helpful and made our vacation even more pleasant. I have never seen a hotel go so out of their way to suit our needs.

There are plenty of activities in which one can indulge in, right from quality of rooms with perfect pool view, variety of cuisine, small section for indoor sports and a super spa.
Will be our first choice of stay in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

All thanks to Tita Pawestri....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1002,One of the best experiences of our life.,50,November 2017,"Room No. 4202

Ramada encore is one of our best experiences, currently I’m staying at the hotel itself. The major reason for me to review it now is that I couldn’t stop myself from praising it. Currently the situation is such that we had our flight tickets back home but it got cancelled due to Mt. Agung volcanic eruption. Hence we had to extend our stay, and we didn’t give a second thought before choosing to stay back at Ramada itself. I would strongly suggest to take this hotel especially the pool view delux room, as they have one of the best pools in bali. Also the service is excellent.

We are pure vegetarians so they also prepared special vegetarian breakfast for us. The staff is really very polite towards the patrons.

Special thanx to “Mr. Agus” at the reception, he is one gem of a person, he also upgraded our room and helped us with a lot of information about the situation. I would give and extra ⭐️ for him.

Thank you once again “Ramada encore” for an amazing hospitality. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1003,Double check on halal food as pork is also served in Ramada encore Bali hotel during breakfast.,30,November 2017,"Overall stay and ambience was good.But when it comes to 🥘. No staff had a idea about halal products. According to staff halal means no pork. They didn't knew the real meaning of halal food. I took up for breakfasts when one of the staff told me there is no pork in breakfast but when I ordered omelet from the kitchen it was under one roof and pan same omelet and pork was cooked.

So even after paying for breakfast I had to go just on vegetables and snacks items.

So request to all Muslim not in every place you get halal food in Bali - Indonesia. Please double check for halal foods.

Secondly I have travelled to many places including Newyorker hotel in Newyork and other whyndham group hotels in New Jersey but till date I have not received my loyalty rewards 💳. Would appreciate if u can look into it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1004,Very good hotel.,50,November 2017,"I stayed only one night, but I really liked the place.
Friendly receptionists, fast checking in. I even got an upgrad, since the hotel was fully booked, and I guess the room I had booked was taken. Really nice.

The room was lovely. It had a little balcony area and access to the pool, which was cool. And it had all the accessories a hotel room should have. Soap and shampoo, toothbrushes, water, tea and coffee.

The food in the restaurant was good, and they even had popcorn. :) So childishly happy for that. The breakfast buffet was extensive and had all you could want, and then some.

As I said, I really liked it. A little feeling of luxury for a reasonable price. :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1006,Pleasant Holiday stay! Amazing staff!,40,November 2017,"Had a nice stay here at this hotel, the staff were amazing which were the best part of the hotel, all staff that we had the pleasure of dealing with from reception to the waiting staff, to the room cleaners every single one of them were so friendly and always asking how our day was etc. My friend had treatments in the spa and commented on how great they were and competitively priced too! Bed was also very comfy too. My only little niggles and reason for not giving 5 stars is the fact that there is really annoying, distasteful music played around the pool which could be heard from our balcony and is not very relaxing. Also the amount added to your bill in the restaurant/ bar equates to nearly 30% extra in service charges/ government taxes. We found this exceptionally high in comparison to other bars/ restaurants and hotels in the area as they were all around 20% standard. It's a shame that it was that little bit more as it put us off tipping the staff anymore as they all worked so hard :) :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1010,Better places to stay,30,November 2017,Had mostly good reviews but a little dissapointed with cleanliness of room and daily cleaning/refreshing. Staff is nice but sometimes hard to communicate. Breakfast options were great on the buffet and an overwhelming amount of guests using their hands to pick up food that should be using tongs. Stolen bread is not uncommon so watch your bread closely. The free shuttle is ridiculously small and very hard to get in. It has limited locations for drop off and they will not pick you up. Highlight of the hotel was closeness of the Murano Spa located on the road leading hotel. Went everyday.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

I was thinking if our room wasn't ready, I would then asked for a favour to keep my luggage and did something else in Seminyak area. But to my surprise, the reception offered to upgrade our room without any additional charges and was ready for us to stay! What a pleasant surprise! The room was great, clean, and we enjoyed the swimming pool a lot. Thank you for a great service!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1017,Service and facilities could have been better (but the pillow is amazing!),30,November 2017,"Pros: Very comfortable bed and (especially) pillows. Enough space in the room to move around, unlike other similar budget hotels. Big pool.

Cons; Service could have been faster and more efficient; they were nice but not efficient enough. Location is pretty far from Sunset Road and you need to use car/motorbike to go around. Also, online taxi is being harassed in the area so they would not come.

A couple of foreigners broke into our room around 3am; they didn't immediately leave the room; probably too drunk to realize they were in the wrong room.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1018,Sorry :(,20,November 2017,"I booked 2 rooms (1308 & 1309), but when we checked-in on 2pm, just room 1309 have ready to stay and we must waited for 3hrs more for them to finish repairing something on room 1308. Why they give us those room even they are repairing the door???? Why not other room?
After that, the service is veryyyy slow. The housekeeper who bring the key for connecting door not coming yet after we remind them almost 5 times to open the connecting door.
Other problem are, the doors not automaticlly closed, so we must push the doors to make sure it closed if not someone outside can open it. And i heard someone knock our door from outside at 12 midnight.
In the morning we got bad experiences in the resto. The host woman asking me to pay additional breakfast in unfriendly speech, well i know breakfast for 4 people but we are 5people, but actually my sister don't want to eat, she just eat my food. If u want me to pay more it's ok but i don't like your intonation of your speech, girl!
Sorry to say but me and my family really dissapointed!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1019,Budget Hotel at Best,30,October 2017,"Booked two Superior Rooms. The hallways & rooms were dark & musty. On the first night we were woken by a bus load of extremely rowdy Chinese looking for their rooms. This went on for over half an hour where other guests who were also woken were now in the hallways yelling for the noise to stop. Upon complaining at reception the next morning we were upgraded to two poolside rooms. (There seemed to be quite a few guests complaining about the same thing) These rooms were much nicer & quieter but did have a mouldy smell. The beds are extremely comfortable & the Air Conditioning worked well. The mould was a concern. Especially on the curtains. Both rooms were the same.

The staff are very friendly & can’t do enough for you. Breakfast was average & catered for the bus loads of Chinese & Indian guests that seemed to arrive every day. The pool area is a big plus. The restaurant was average but the prices reflected this.

The hotel is surrounded by villas & you can’t really walk anywhere. You have to get a taxi every time you leave the hotel or you can wait for the hotel shuttle bus which only leaves twice a day.

Would we stay there again? Probably not. Mainly due to the location & the bus loads of tourists. For such a young hotel it is already looking tired.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1020,Nice Hotel in Isolated Location.,40,October 2017,"We found the Hotel perfect but unfortunately it is too isolated.
There are no shops or restaurants around the area.
Every time we went anywhere we had to use a taxi as there is nothing around this vacinity.
The hotel does have a shuttle service but it doesn't run offten enough, plus it only drops off, no return service back to the hotel.
Apart from the isolation everything else was great, lovely rooms, good selection buffet breakfast plus a beautiful pool. To eat at the restaurant was reasonable price but be aware of the + + taxes they put onto your bill, nearly 40%.
Loved the Hotel the staff were wonderful but unfortunately due to its location we wont stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1021,RAMADA YOU BEAUTY!,50,November 2017,"first time in Bali and this hotel was basically the cherry on top!
have never experienced hotel staff being so warm and welcoming til i stayed here, Yuni and Tita YOUR AMAZING! Highlight of my stay was basically that beautiful pool thank you to reception for upgrading our room on the spot when we realised the view of the pool was too good to miss! Ive already recommended Ramada to my friends and family will definately be coming back!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1022,Great Experience !,50,April 2017,"We stay for one night in this great hotel
The staff is really perfect specially Ditha who is really concerned about her job, and who made everything to make our stay perfect.
Room clean and perfect, restaurant delicious and pool is incredible",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1023,very far off from beach and market,20,October 2017,"hotel is very far off from beach , market or happening areas.there are no fans in balconies . Mosquito problem is also there. Rooms are not properly lighted. House keeping services can be availed once only. BREAK FASTis just normal",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1024,smelly/poor ventilated room,10,November 2017,"smelly/poor ventilated room , staff couldn't help , they didn't allow me to open the window to circulate air , its was terrible experience.
I wouldnt recommend this hotel . photo didn't reflect the reality , smell i think due to humidity",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1025,Couldn’t ask for more at price ; Super staff ; great pool 🍹,40,October 2017,"....location was ok for us but required a taxi to get anywhere not even a convenience store in walking distance; while it is only $5au to get into Seminyak it’s something to keep in mind.
Sadly the first 4 days were great ; then a tour of Chinese families arrived who took over , the pool it was crowded with screaming undisciplined children, the restaurant overrun, the facilities taken over ... on two different occasions witnessed men spit it the pool !!!.. Not ok and while it is not the hotels fault it is also something to consider as it IS a hotel chain that caters to the Chinese 😏",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1026,Overall fine stay... Near Seminyak Market,30,October 2017,"The rooms are good and the connectivity to Seminyak market is about 7 minutes on foot. The market close-by have many shops including handicrafts, souvenir and many restaurants. The food at the restaurants can be improved,",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1027,A hotel / resort worth considering.,40,October 2017,"The hotel which looks like more of a resort is worth a stay. Its a huge property with a very large swimming pool, well lit up with a huge restaurant just by the pool side. The menu is very wide and you will love it if you are a non vegetarian. But if you are a vegetarian, you will have to do a lot of brain storming with the chef to prepare a full veg dish and they will gladly do so. It has a well stocked bar as well. The rooms are large and some are pool facing while the others are city facing. The rooms are with full amenities. You will love the pool view from your balcony. Assure you..! It is located in a small residential area with a few villas here & there but is very peaceful and silent. The staff is very warm and courteous. The breakfast is a wide spread out one. Plenty of food all over. The only minus points are...its a few minutes from the city main road and its lack of vegetarian choices in the menu.

But inspite of it, I will highly recommend it. I visited in Oct 2017 and stayed on the 4th floor for 4 nights and just loved it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1028,Relaxing Holiday,50,October 2017,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, location and facilities were amazing, beautiful and well looked after. Staff were incredibly helpful, friendly and professional. Would stay here again!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1029,Exceptionally friendly staff,50,October 2017,"Property is a short taxi trip away from the hustle and bustle of seminyak square and kuta shopping district. Service is excellent, rooms are very clean and the pool area is great to relax.
Breakfast is amazing with great choice. Pool bar and restaurant has a large choice of snacks and evening meals.
Cost $18 aud from airport ( pre booked).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1030,Our Stay,40,October 2017,"Most of the sun chairs were in the water and sometimes was a case of the towel or something else dropping into the water.
The set up of the resort meant a lot of the sunchairs were not all day in the sun and there were not enough chairs avail for the number guests at all. We found ourselves sitting at a table in anticipation of someone moving from a chair so found ourselves most days getting out of the resort so we could be relax in the sun for the day. Breakfast catered a lot more for Asians too.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1031,Excellent value for money,40,October 2017,"Crashed here on the end of a late night flight and it was exceptionally good value for money. The staff were acomodating, beds supremely comfortable and all up incredible value for money. Buffet breakfast was only 8,500 and very good value also. Would definitely stay here again for a first stop post airport landing.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1032,Good hotel to sleep,30,October 2017,"I've got upgraded to a deluxe pool view room. The pool was very excited, there was an inflatable pillow in the pool. But the location is on the dead street.

Location is good,away from noise and traffic.
Seminyak street is also nearby for shooping and beach.Hotel provides shuttle bus service to go seminyak.
Can suggest all to stay here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1035,Budget hotel,30,August 2017,"This is budget hotel, u cant get more service from budget hotel. But they have a very good pillow.

Location is far from any attractions, not recomended if u dont have transportation. U cant use uber, etc in this hotel area",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1036,It's all about taking your money,10,October 2017,"The room really smelled like mould, and there was visible mould on several areas, with tiny creatures crawling everywhere. At first we were scared they were bed bugs but they turned out to be booklice - not a relaxing night at all!

They try to get money out of you for everything. They only call taxis from blue bird for a huge rate, usually twice or triple the normal cost. Probably they have a deal with the company.
To play on their very, very bad pool table you have to spend a certain amount of money buying overpriced drinks, and only get 2 games. Only the bar people can reset the balls so you have to walk over there every time you want a reset, providing you keep buying drinks.

They don't even have a map of the city! Just a bad quality copy of a printed map, which doesn't cover anything.

Probably the management is really bad",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1039,Great value for money. Amazing food. Shame about the cba attitude from the staff apart from a young girl,40,October 2017,Very good value. Stayed in the deluxe pool view. Big room. Nice balcony and view. Clean room. And clean towels daily. Food was great surprisingly good intact but breakfast was a left down struggled to find anything I liked and I am not fussy. The staff though lacked enthusiasm couldn't be bothered apart from one young girl who really worked hard. Had to keep taking hand to get attention from huddled up group talking or clearly showing it be obvious they was ignoring us as they didn't want to anything especially to clear plates. Reception staff were great. Cleaning staff great and friendly. Pool very clean. Had a heaven on earth package at the spa... was amazing!!!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1040,Getting improved,50,October 2017,"One year a go exactly, i stayed at this hotel, this hotel getting improved, so clean, fast response staff. The breakfast very nice and simple. The restaurant very great, taste of the food very good. Appreciate with chef umar, he made a very delicious thin pizza ever, same like european taste. Nice choice if we go to seminyak area.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1041,Excellent Quality & Value For Money,40,October 2017,"The hotel is typical of the high standard of the Ramada Chain. One draw back is it's location. Being far from the beaches, restaurant areas and malls. I was disappointed the staff did not assist guests with more economical modes of transport such as Uber, Grab or Go-Jek. All readily available and would have easily overcome the distance issue. I recommend the management sponsor utility staff with English courses. All staff were extremely helpful and proficient. With a few fluency in English is needed.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1042,Per total ok,40,October 2017,"We staid here for 4 nights. The swimmingpool is looking great. The breakfast is good, medium variety of food ( european and asian ), but if you are a coffee drinker you will be a little dissapointed. We had ground level rooms with direct acces to the pool. The rooms are clean ( 8/10 ). The problem that we all had and also other clients was the humidity in the room, creating a bad smell. We requested several times to change the complete bed sheets but it didn't help. Food is in the restaurant is good but the portions are quite small. No acces of uber, grab car, etc. Per total it's a good hotel but don't expect to find a true Bali experience here as this is a multinational hotel group.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1043,Excellent value,40,October 2017,"Throughly enjoyed our stay here wonderful staff,clean rooms,great pool area the only thing it was a little to far from everything you have to get transport all the time but that is a very minor negative",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1044,Not good,20,October 2017,"The staff at this hotel are amazing. Great service for the most part. If you get a massage ask for Drimi, and if you want a pedicure ask for Puto.

Unfortunately the rooms, while OK, need help. We had black mold in the shower. The bed linens are quite fatigued, nice and white but aged. We will choose a different hotel next time.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1045,Great stay!,50,October 2017,"I stayed at the Ramada Encore for 14 days.

Would recommend to stay here in bali. I loved it! Only negative is very slow internet.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1046,Good relaxing place to stay,40,October 2017,"Stayed here for two weeks with a friend and found this a lovely clean hotel in a quiet locality, rooms and pool area are kept clean and well maintained, all staff members are pleasant, helpful and polite at all times. This is a good value for money hotel which I would not hesitate to recommend.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1047,Great cheap place to stay,30,October 2017,"Stayed here for two nights with my sister.
For what you pay ($70/night) it's quite a nice place and we were surprised at the beautiful garden and pool especially.
Rooms were clean and comfy.
Breakkie was good.
Staff were ok- not really over welcoming or friendly.
The ramada is a 5min cab from seminyak and 10-15 to Kuta.
We went to order a taxi from front and they wanted to charge $20 aud for taxi without meter... absolutely ridiculous- trying to rip off tourists. I knew for a fact a taxi with Meter was only about $5-$8.
So they ordered us a taxi which took about 10mins and what do you know cost us $5 aud.
Overall a good stay for cheap nightly rate.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1048,Disappointed,30,October 2017,"Staff were friendly and helpful however, the condition and cleanliness of the room is disappointing.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1049,Happening Place,30,October 2017,The hotel was good if considered for value for money ! The swimming pool and activities are fun ! Also the staff was helpful. The hotel is bit on the inside so location access is bit difficult. Also the bar and restaurant was fun place to sit and enjoy !,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1050,bit difficult for transportation,30,October 2017,if you dependable to online transportation then dont choose this hotel. online transportation like grab or gocar or uber is not allowed to pick up passanger from this hotel. instead they charged by their own taxi service with ridiculous fare. to nearby they charge 50 thousand idr. and shuttle bus they provide not allow any luggage carried also. but for breakfast is okay. room okay. if you want to stay in hoel and not intend to go around outside then okay,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1051,Great pool and clean room,40,October 2017,"Located in Seminyak, this hotel has pretty big pool. The room and bathroom is clean but I found out the sofa pillow is a little bit stink. There's a lot of parking space very near to lobby entrance. The staff is friendly and overall still a great hotel to stay and worth the price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1052,Great stay but some improvements possible!,40,October 2017,"This was our first time staying in Bali. We were looking for somewhere to relax for our initial 5 nights and somewhere with easy access to the centre.

In terms of relaxation, this hotel ticks all the boxes. The pool is amazing with fabulous loungers in shallow water, excellent for refreshment in the hot sun! Our only complaint about the pool was the constant smoking by other guests. Our deluxe room was very comfortable and had a huge bed!

We were slightly disappointed in the breakfast. Some of the breads were stale, the juices weren’t great, and the hot food options were a bit strange! However we occasionally ate in the restaurant for lunch and dinner, and were not disappointed. Would highly recommend the Kung Pao Chicken!

Location wise, the hotel was slightly further from the centre than expected (ie. we could not walk back at night). The hotel did however provide a free shuttle service but drop off only at Seminyak Square or in Kuta.

All in all, we really did enjoy our time staying here. The staff were great and always willing to help.

4/5",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1053,Fantastic hotel,50,October 2017,"This hotel is beautiful. I cannot fault it at all, it was lovely. The staff were absolutely delightful throughout and the hotel was exceptionally clean and tidy. The pol area was immaculate, and the food and drink served by the hotel was excellent quality and price. Especially the cocktails. The hotel is about a 5/10 minute drive from Seminyak square, but taxis are exceptionally cheap. Bluebird taxi group were great and reasonable. The hotel also provide a shuttle service to Seminyak and Kuta which were reliable and could always book onto them. I truly could not find any fault with the hotel, staff and the service provided. There is also an excellent spa a few minutes walk from the hotel called Murano spa.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1054,Love love love,50,October 2017,First time goes to Encore Ramada and it was amazing place for my family...great pool n services....i will come back another day,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1055,Great short holiday,40,October 2017,"Staff very friendly. Always willing to help. I was upgraded to a studio which wad very nice. Breakfast service needs to be upgraded. Selection was more local food. Needs more healthy cereal s breads, yogurts etc. Overall great affordable getaway.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1057,Worth Every Penny Spent,50,October 2017,"Where do I start?!! The moment I entered I knew that I am going to enjoy in this place. It's a great place. I just stayed here for two nights in my four nights trip to Bali. I really regret the decision now. I wish that I booked this place for all the four nights. I am actually even shocked to see negative reviews about this place. I really loved this hotel. We are totally 6 adults. So, we booked three rooms. We all loved this place. Being a vegeterian, food is always a concern when we go outside. But this place has wide variety of options which helped us to relish delicious breakfast. Pool looked spectacular. Also, the hotel provides free shuttle service to kuta beach and Seminyak square which is actually very helpful if you have a free day. The staffs are very friendly. Particularly, Mrs.Tirta (spelling?!) helped me a lot and offered assistance through watsapp even before i reached Bali. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1058,Relaxing holiday,40,September 2017,"Stayed at Ramada Encore Seminyak for eight nights with family. Amazing staff in the restaurant, very good quality of food at breakfast with wide spread of buffet and live egg station, fantastic lagoon pool, very welcoming staff at the reception in particular Tita was very helpful, the young man from housekeeping who serviced our room was good. Only negative was the soundproofing in rooms is awful to the extent you could hear people in the adjacent room, talking in the corridor and the lift calls throughout the day and night... also in our room, there were these tiny insects like the ones develop because of moist conditions - coming from behind the panel near the coffee maker, may be worth investigating...

Overall a perfect relaxing holiday!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1059,Ok,30,October 2017,A lot of walking required at this hotel. Rooms are spacious and well equipped although fridge was completely ineffective. If you are staying here I would recommend upgrading to a pool access room. Otherwise pool access is a bit complicated and not terribly convenient.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1060,Place to chill,40,September 2017,Ramada Encore is a really good place to chill with family and friends. There are shuttle services to nearby markets and temples. The lagoon pool in the center of the hotel is an excellent place to relax and spend lazy afternoons.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1061,Excellent Room,50,August 2017,"Room was big enough for 3 person to move around. Amenities provided was great. Location of the hotel is far from the main road, perfect for getaway. Swimming pool was amazing!! Also the bar. Keep up the good service!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1062,"Nice hotel and swimmingpool, friendly staff and good...",30,September 2017,"Nice hotel and swimmingpool, friendly staff and good breakfast. Maybe in the future add some gluten-free bread.
We had a superior room, and the bed was very good. The only bad thing, it was very noisy on the hallway. Late at night and early in the morning you woke up many times because of the noise.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1063,Not what I expected,20,October 2017,"I came to this hotel hoping to get some rest and get some work done. I tried checking in straight after I arrived from the airport and they were trying to charge me 4x the price it said online on multiple websites, even though it was after 12 midnight. I ended up booking it online but it wouldn't let me book for the night I needed it since it was after midnight, so I stayed the next night. I ended up going to a neighboring hotel in the middle of the night since Ramada wouldn""t allow me to book the room for the same price as online. I loved the neighboring hotel and it was way cheaper and so so peaceful, I would have loved to stay there the next night but my booking was unrefundable at Ramada.
The next day I arrived for my stay, check in said 3pm so I arrived at 3:15, I was told my room was not ready and I waited over 1 hour to check in. I was given a rancid tasting strawberry drink that I didn't want as a gesture to rectify the situation.
All the rooms are surrounded around the pool which have many children playing all day and screaming loudly. It's a very noisy hotel, i could hear people walking and talking in the hallway at all hours of the night. I got zero work done and not much rest which was the reason for my stay.The wifi went out every 5 minutes as well. That was a huge contributing factor to the lack of work I got done.
It also just so happened that the night of my stay, there was a huge party right outside my room. There was a DJ and they were blasting music until 10pm, I actually had to change rooms because it was impossible to even think with it so loud in my room and balcony.
When I changed rooms, the wifi got worse.
This was a complete waste of money.

The hotel should make it clear that it's extremely kid friendly and loud with children screaming in the pool from 8am-6:30pm",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1064,Not so nice,10,September 2017,"The people and staff of the country were very nice and friendly well that's some of them
The service in the restaurant was very poor and you had to wait a hell of a long time to order eat and paid for your meal well over 15 mins for each service.
The room was dirty and dust was everywhere. we had to asks for our room to be clean.
The sheets well let's not go there.
After travelling for such a long time to get to bali I was very disappointed and won't be going back.
The advice I will give anyone going to bali for the first time is not to stay at this hotel and check your room accommodation before you leave..our view was a field with cows in it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1065,Service recovery,40,September 2017,"Firstly this is my 3rd stay at the Ramada and what I love about it is the hospitality I receive from a lot of the staff, especially Gita and Dewi who have always ensured my stay has been pleasant, Novi at the bar and Aliando who always ensures the gardens are looking there best but always up for a chat and help with any questions you have. He is a friend rather than just an employee and I sure other guests feel the same when they meet him. Hermanto from housekeeping is an asset ensuring my sisters room was well kept during her stay and executing a special birthday message, and whilst he did not clean my room this stay, he has done an amazing job previously for me.
However this is where the negatives begin, my room was not cleaned twice during my stay this time round and whilst this may not seem a big issue, water is not refilled, towels left wet on the floor with no clean ones to dry yourself and bins overflowing. An apology was made for each occasion however steps should be made to ensure this does not happen.
Also a guest next door became intoxicated and disturbing the peace for not just me but other guest close by and as a result I had to move rooms twice in the same night resulting in me loosing most of my nights sleep by the time the resolution was in place. Once again an apology was made but that was about it.
I have not once had an issue with this hotel but this time I have left feeling a little underwhelmed by the service recovery standards.
Overall the hotel is lovely and the pool is the centre piece and would still stay again but Management need to ensure that basics such as housekeeping are being done as scheduled and maybe some systems to effectively deal with poorly behaving guests.

1066,Location is not great.,20,September 2017,"This hotel is quite far from the beach. The rooms don't even have a minibar and yet it calls itself a four star hotel. The fridge in the room barely gets cold.

1067,Not so good,30,September 2017,"We stayed here for a week. The hotel was not so good. The pictures they posted on website was so deceiving.

1068,It's okay,20,September 2017,"The hotel needs a little bit of refreshment.. not much (day)light in the room and the bed sheets doesn't smell very good even after they've cleaned it.

Other than that the hotel is overally good.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1072,Super nice hotel!,50,September 2017,"The hotel is very nice, very big and clean pool, the buffet for breakfast is literally amazing, also the food from the 24 hours restaurant is very good. Please try blueberry smoothie. Everyday the clean the rooms (not very well to be honest and my room had to many aunts) by even do I will come back to this Hotel.
Bed is super confortable and the staff is the best that you can find. Tita, thank you very much for everything, you are amazing!
Internet works perfectly!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1073,Pictures are so deceiving!!,20,September 2017,"Stayed here for 7 nights with my partner in an executive deluxe room.

Negatives - Looked very clean in pictures however was very old and stuffy with ants everywhere and dirty sinks. Curtains were very dirty so was the sofa in the balcony. Air con was loud. Refrigerator was loud! Housekeeping would be knocking on your door at 7:30 in the morning. Lack on english with most staff to the point where you have to break things down so much and use your hands to describe something which was so draining. Stuffy corridors. Lastly you can only sunbathe during certain hours of the day as you don't get any sun due to buildings around the pool area blocking the sun.

Positives - Friendly staff. Food was good. Drinks were good. Cheep hotel. Location was ok. Live music and entertainment on some nights of the week.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1074,Hôtel et prestations correctes!,40,September 2017,"we had a great time and we especially thank dewie, hendra, suantari, rita and diah for their kindness and professionalism top service! it is so important to have perfect staff especially in a foreign country it is very appreciable therefore still thank you infinitely for your attentions !!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1075,Very liveable,40,September 2017,"We stayed at the Ramada Encore for 7 nights and enjoyed it all. Only thing was we had a noisy air con but that was easy to block out. The menu has a huge variety, as does the breakfast buffet and spa. The price was what you paid, nice but nothing over the top. We loved the pool chairs in the water plus the super friendly staff. Used the shuttle into Seminyak- just a shame it doesn't pick up. Reception staff super helpful when it comes to help, they booked taxis and figured out everything with ease. Really enjoyed this place and would recommend to anyone.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1076,Value for money,50,September 2017,Good hotel for the price you pay. I should appreciate the front office staff as they upgraded my room before my arrival. They are very cooperative and ready to help you. Specially appreciate Ms Tita for her support.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1077,it is siutibale for all ages.,50,July 2017,"my favroite part was the gym. and also the swimming pool with kids zone.
Staff is friendly and peaceful. They have babysitters but there is not a proper kids plaground. Rooms are big enough and cleaned.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1078,Not a bad find!,40,September 2017,"Not a bad find, staff helpful, pool lovely, food (breakfast) could be better but not bad. Decently priced but doesn't seem like the place to hang out in the ending for young adults.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1079,"Superb... Off the main Seminyak tourist stretch, which translates into peace and quiet",50,September 2017,"It is surrounded by villas, so it is may seem like it's in the middle of nowhere, but it is just 1 km from the main road Jalan Sunset. For the price you pay, we have no complaints. Plus, it was our wedding anniversary and we were given a free upgrade and rose petals on the bed reading Happy Anniv

What we loved:
- THE POOL, the amazing pool! Not a fallen leaf in sight.
- the quite sufficient breakfast buffet is spread in all directions.
- the food was great at dinner.
- the coffee was great, though cheesecake not the best.
- the very attentive staff especially Asri who checked us in and helped us throughout.

What could be improved if we were nitpicking:
- open up the lobby area instead of having two sitting areas back to back
- one part of the lobby is quite dated.
- extend pool hours, since the bar is 24/7, and there is nothing to do after 9pm.
- some carpeting in the room. The floor was super-cold all the time.
- more frequent round-the-clock shuttles out of the hotel; even if with a small fee.
- more coffee/cream/sugar in the room.

Other plus points:
-There is a lovely spa down the road, Murano Spa. Value unlike anything you'll get in Jalan Seminyak. We went there almost every day we were in Bali. Just Rp200,000 for 2 hours and you get the works, including a scrub and flower bath and a small private garden each.

The only minus point:
-The airport shuttle is terribly overpriced.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1080,GREAT BREKFAST,50,September 2017,"ground floor room, a few steps and your in the pool.

1081,A hotel that suitable for family,30,August 2017,"I stayed 2 nights here, although check in process took long time (even we're late check in, about 6pm and no long queue at that time), finally they upgraded our room to suite with pool view.

The room is spacious. There are wardrobe area at front, suitable to put your luggages more freely.

Breakfast have not many options, the food taste's so so, but the restaurant ambience is nice, it directly face the pool.

When I stayed here, most of the guest are also group of family.

Hotel location is remote, need car or motorcycle to reach there. Parking lot is spacious.

The have big swimming pools.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1082,Our favourite hotel,50,September 2017,"I would like to say how much I love Ramada Encore in Seminyak . We are a family of 5 and love the family apartments . The staff are just lovely and we have got to know some staff quite well.
Dewi is such a lovely waitress and will help you with all your requests . Aliandro is a friendly guy who does a great job in the garden and always smiles and then there is Adi who is a driver at ramada and we just love him . Ramada Encore is our home away from home and we always stay here and it's people like the ones I've mentioned that keep us coming back",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1083,remote location..but big pool...nice hotel,30,November 2016,"i stay at this hotel for 3 days...hotel with big pool...but remote location...you need a motorcyle or a car because it is far from the main road....average room, good bf and delicious...love this hotel but its hard if you havent had a bike or car...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1084,Perfect,50,September 2017,"From start to finish all the staff was very helpful and extremely friendly, it was my first time in Bali and I felt very welcomed! Me and all my family made good friends with the gardener aliando , and he helped us out in anyway he could . From ordering taxis to giving us good advice about his beautiful country! The wifi was extremely reliable too! The food was very fresh and tasty! Would recommend this hotel to anyone. And don't forget to go find Ali for help 😀",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1085,there is no hospitality like understanding,50,September 2017,"stayed here for 3 nights, hotel has an amazing decor, beautifully lit pool, delicious food and very courteous staff...
this is fairly a new hotel and rooms are very clean.
Food at Mahadewi restaurant is amazing.
Great breakfast spread.
highly recommended to stay here...

Special shout out to their Guest relations manager Ms. Tita for her great support in planning our tour, arranging bikes, booking our tickets etc. very understanding and friendly.. :D",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1086,Just magnificent!,50,September 2017,"Our stay was really awesome! We required some special services and they provided us with all what we needed. The staff is very prpfessional, service is just excellent. If we come back to Seminyak, we will certainly book here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1087,"Facility is great, service and shuttle not so much",30,September 2017,"Me and my girlfriend stayed for two nights here. The room and pool were great however we were given dirty towels on both days, the shuttle service was very poor with only two times per day limited to 16 guests from the whole hotel, so availability was scarce. We ended up spending a fair amount on taxis so factor that into your stay. The food was good on the whole but service was terrible, hard to get the staffs attention but they were friendly. The gym is also fairly limited but ok if only there for a day or two.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1088,Excellent,50,September 2017,"Excellent hotel, very friendly staff that are more than happy to help with any issues. The wifi is very good with a steady strong connection, I would especially like to mention the Gardner Ali he is a very helpful and friendly guy he goes above and beyond his duties as a Gardner to make you feel welcome and helps with any questions you may have! He also keeps the grounds looking beautiful! I would definitely recommend this hotel! Anyone visiting Ramada encore be sure too look out for Ali 😊",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1089,A paradise in paradise,50,September 2017,The hotel looks amazing and the staff are really friendly and polite. The only downside I experienced are the large groups of rude Chinese tourists. They were very loud at don't respect the house rules.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1090,6 night stay with kids- Cant fault it,50,September 2017,Stayed here for 6 nights with 2 kids aged 16 and 6 and really enjoyed it! Though a short taxi ride to the main shops of Seminyak (around $2aud) this was a great place to stay. All the staff were extremely helpful and we had no drama getting an upgrade to a poolside room but I must single out Tita for her amazing help on a number of things. She was adored by my young son Reef and she is a credit to both the Ramada brand and herself. Would highly recommend to anyone who is after a high quality budget conscious stay.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1091,Great hotel and great staff,50,August 2017,"We stayed here for two weeks and I honestly can't say enough great things about this hotel.
When we arrived we were upgraded to a better room for free with a balcony overlooking the pool. The balcony itself is massive and it was enjoyable to have room service out there at night.
The cleaners are amazing here, some days we wanted a lay in and wouldn't leave the room until after 12, I hadn't expected them to clean the room after this time as I know they do them in the mornings...however anytime we left the room we would come back and someone had cleaned it! I didn't expect it so it was a lovely surprise!
Other reviews say about dirty bathrooms, ours was spotless and everything in the room worked as it should.
We often ate out but a few times had lunch at the hotel which we found to be nice with good size portions.
All of the staff here are really friendly and make an effort to talk to you, even one man who was painting the railings outside our room. The bar staff come and set up the pool balls for you when you play as well which is really kind. The reception staff are happy to order you a bluebird taxi, we learnt in the evenings this can take about 10minutes so we would ring down and book in advance.
The hotel is about a 5 minute drive away from restaurants on the outskirts and about 10minutes (depending on traffic) from the main area of Seminyak but I liked the hotel being away from the main area. The security on the gate is great as well and was reassuring. Very happy with this hotel and would stay again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1092,Great friendly staff,40,August 2017,"We chose this Hotel as it was in the price range we wanted ,which was good value for the 10 nights we stayed .
A few complaints , firstly there was a little mould on the curtain backings which gave a slight smell but having said that the aircon was great & cleared the air quickly & was very quiet.
House keeping could have been a bit better , some days better than others but not consistent in cleaning .
The pool lost sun at around 4 pm but it was a good pool & well maintained with poolside bar .
On the upside , bed was super comfortable & I slept well every night which is a huge bonus from me. Nice little balcony to enjoy an evening drink & area to dry clothing .
Breakfast was ok , not a huge variety of food but still good apart from coffee ( need to leave resort for a good coffee)
Although hotel is located short distance from main area of Seminyak , it's still a little out of the way. We did walk many times but due to the crazy traffic this can be scary at times . It was only about $2AUS in a Bluebird taxi so not a huge issue.
Although not as close to beach as other hotels , still a good place to stay to save $ , we still had a great holiday , even with the few minor negatives",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1093,Srinivas & Family Amazing Stay @ Ramada encore - Vacation to Bali in August 2017,50,August 2017,"I must be humble and honest in Admitting one thing that Ramada Encore was my Second During may stay in Bali. The staff was amazing and so cooperative, being with kids we had the challenge of appropriate food for Kids and they were really very supportive in helping us get the desired cuisine. The Rooms were clean Pool was great and I must mention about one special person Miss. Tita She was more than an Angle in accommodating and catering to all our needs and requests. She is the best Host I have ever met considering my stay in almost more than 50 hotels that I have been world wide.

Thank You Tita : She organized our trips, our transport and not to miss she took care of our healthcare needs when me and my daughter fell sick, she was prompt in sending a doctor to our room and helping us with the appropriate medication and care.

If not For Tita our Trip would not have been so great.

Simply Superb Experience in Ramada Encore its a great value for Money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1094,Do not be confused with Ramada sunset road,30,September 2017,"Yup, I was confused between Ramada encore and Ramada sunset road since they both are in Seminyak area :D

Note:
Room #2225 and 2229
Standard room, no breakfast, twin share and double room.

+ nice pool and lounge area.
+ helpful staff although the service is really slow.
+ good lighting.

- bed sheet with several stain.
- it's not soundproof, I don't expect much but even someone walking normally can be heard from my room!
- The air conditioner fan cannot be adjust, it just completely shut down if you adjust the fan to low.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1095,Pleasant stay,40,August 2017,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our Bali trip. The reception upgraded us to a bigger room which was nice, however we were on the ground floor, which left little privacy and we couldn't really use our patio doors as there were always people in the pool -even at night. Breakfast was excellent, lots of choice and good times, and the hotel offered a shuttle service into Seminyak centre which was good. However, the shuttle service was infrequent so we usually had to get taxis to and from the hotel. The hotel staff were friendly but they didn't seem to know much about tourist trips and excursions which other hotels in Bali did. If you want a clean, safe, pleasant hotel in Seminyak then this is great. If you want something more Indonesian and less western then this is not for you.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1096,Good value for money.,40,August 2017,"My wife and I stayed for seven days 26/8-2/9/2017.
We had a relaxing time. The pool area is very nice.
We stayed in a poolside room. This room has some small maintainence issues, however it has a comfortable bed, hot shower,widescreen tv, bar fridge, safe etc, and easy access to a fantastic pool.
The room was serviced everyday and restocked with 2 bottles of water etc.
Thank you to the housekeeping staff, particularly Sima Jaya for the great service.
The breakfast was enjoyable and plentiful.The food and beverage staff friendly and courteous.
The hotel has a free One way shuttle service.
We also had the front desk organise a bluebird taxi on several occasions, and never waited more than 10 mins for them to arrive.
The front desk staff and management are very friendly and helpful.
Arranged for a late checkout till 3pm free of charge on our day of departure.

We thank all the staff of The Ramada Encore for an enjoyable stay and good service.

1097,"Excellent Hotel - Great staff, Very good service, Had a pleasent stay",50,August 2017,"We booked this hotel based on our previous experience of staying in Ramada chain at other places. We have always found Ramada to offer excellent services and this time also they met our Expectation.

I would like to start with hotel, The property is very good, rooms are spacious, and bed is comfy. The hotel offers all the basic amenities like toiletries, slippers, e-locker facilities, 24 hours hot shower, dental kit, shower cap, etc.

The rooms are really good. But the best part about the hotel is Pool area, which is excellent. The pool has a kid section, a pool bar, Pool recliners, etc. The hotel has a in-house restaurant and offers a free buffet breakfast, which is decent.

Location of hotel is decent. You can rent a bike from hotel which cost you 70,000 IDR (350 INR, or 5$ approx) which is very cheap. Once you rent the bike you can visit various restaurant which are nearby in a range of 1-2 Kms. Seminyak area has lot to offer for food-lovers, and shoppers.

However I was most surprised by the excellent services by hotel staff. This really made our stay wonderful. The only reason I am writing this review is because I want to let others know that services of hotel staff are just excellent.

Our Guest relation officer was Mrs. Tita, and she made sure that even in a foreign country, we get all the facilities without hassle. She went beyond her duties to help us.

Our Room cleaning staff was Mr. Hermanto, He paid attention to the smallest of details and was available on a single call throughout the day.

Extremely polite and friendly staff, Just loved it.

Thanks to Tita & Hermanto and whole Hotel Ramada for making our stay wonderful. The memories of Bali will be cherished throughout our life.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1100,Relaxing holiday,40,August 2017,"My husband and I stayed at the Ramada Encore and we had a lovely time. The hotel staff is really nice, professional and very helpful. The pool is really nice and the athmosphere is good. We stayed for 8 nights, had a room with a balcony on the second floor. The room was very nice with a super comfortable bed, couldnt falt the room at all and the cleaners did a creat job. The only negative would be that some of the sunbeds were not so comfortable, the food in the resturang was ok. The hotel was lokated slightly outside the Semiyak town cetre so we needed to take a taxi there and back, didnt cost much and the hotel hd many waiting outside the whole time. Free shuttlebusses was also avaliable. A minutes walk from the hotel was a super nice spa with very ok prices. Would defenatly stay at the Ramada Encore again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1101,Quiet getaway,50,August 2017,"Really enjoyed my stay. From check in to check out the service was wonderful. Loved that they are an Eco friendly hotel and give you the option of when you want your bedding changed, saves on water. The bed was big and they have black out curtains for a cosy sleep in. Aircon worked awesome. Tucked away but close to everything. Room service nice, pasta pesto was my favourite. The pool area is gorgeous. Very happy overall with my stay and would stay again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The restaurant is by the pool, so it's a great location. Non vegetarians have no trouble, for vegetarians, if you meet the chef the previous night, then you can get some veggie food for breakfast. Else, you must be happy with bread, toast, coffee, cheese, cornflakes etc. Normally, the pastas and fried rice are made with eggs. If you specify, then they ll make it for you specially. We got pasta and fried rice done. Very polite staff. Don't change your currency there. The pool is excellent. Very pleasant stay. Uber is competitive than the hotel transport. They gave shuttle to the airport but they don't reply mails easily",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1105,Not 4 star!,20,August 2017,I recently took my family to bali for a week and stayed at this hotel. I was very disappointed. First our room was not ready and we waited over 1hr to access the room but kept getting told it would be ready in 10min. The towel were very dirty grey color and in despirate need of replacing. The house keeping was very poor and did not bother to clean the bathroom properly. The pillows and doonas were stained and many of the staff dont speak much english. The vents in the room for the aircon had so much dust it looked like they had never been cleaned. Dont waste your money go somewhere else.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1106,Good hotel for family holiday,30,August 2017,"I have been staying 5 or 6 times at the Ramada Encore in the last two years and this time might have been my last time. The hotel is located in a very quiet area of Seminyak, which I personally prefer, but you can walk to the busy part with shops, restaurants and bars within 5 minutes. I tend to stay in one of the Pool View rooms with balcony but at my last two stays I really found the room too noisy in regards to the screaming coming from the pool area. At my last visit I had requested a quiet room as I came for medical treatment and also had a fair bit of work/writing to do, this was basically ignored. I am not sure if the hotel is under new management as the house keeping was pretty bad at my last stay (August 2017), I had to ask for missing things such as shower gel or soap nearly every day. On occasions they seemed to have run out of clean towels which then were brought later in the evening. Once I got a 'fresh' sheet with fresh blood stains. The covers of the outdoor furniture (on the balcony and the restaurant) look like they have not been washed since months.....
Having said all this the staff is very friendly, the breakfast buffet is very good and the pool is huge. I believe this hotel is a great choice for families, for single travelers, business or a romantic get-away for couples maybe not so good.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1107,Beautiful staff,40,August 2017,"Our room was spacious and bed was very comfortable, However the empty mini bar was terrible it would not cool anything. We had to borrow a esky from our driver and buy ice everyday. Also the resort is beautiful but to far out from shops or anything interesting, so have to catch cabs if shuttle bus was unavailable (shuttle was 4 time to seminyak square or 2 times to Kuta Daily) nothing at night.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1108,Great affordable property!,50,August 2017,"Pros:
- 24 hour room service
- Comprehensive meal menu
- Great range for breakfast
- Big lagoon style pool
- Friendly staff
- Nice small but comprensive gym
- Complimentary shuttle drop off to Seminyak Square areas
a few times a day (very handy as hotel location is quite isolated from everything else!!)

Cons:
- Not enough pool lounge chairs in the adult area of pool area (to be away from the noisy kids/shallow pool area

Great choice! Would recommend and would consider going back in the future.

Thanks Ramada Encore!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1109,"Clean room,average service",30,August 2017,"Hotel was pretty serene compared to other hotels in Seminyak area.

They have a lovely pool and well maintained guest rooms compared to similar hotels that operate within the same years.

The room was clean while the bathroom was a bit small though.

Lobby and restaurant area was nice. However, the design of room corridor and the guest / bathroom room door was poor that made it look like a student dorminatory.

We did not have our breakfast due to our early flight",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1110,Nice hotel,40,August 2017,"We have a great time at Seminyak - Ramada Encore Bali

Thanks for all",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1111,3rd stay at this hotel - there are Pros and Cons,30,August 2017,"The rooms are becoming tired because they're not being maintained. Ie, mould on shower curtains, dirty curtains and wallpaper, small holes in linen, grey and well used towels ~ simple things that would need to be improved for us to stay again. Over the past 2 years we've stayed here 3 times, the rooms are going downhill quickly though which is a real shame. On the upside, we don't spend a lot of time in the rooms, the pool is huge and amazing, warm and child friendly featuring a large kids pool. Plenty of sun loungers and the staff are the friendliest we have encountered in Bali. The buffet breakfast has a great selection and we find the quality great. We especially like the automatic coffee machines for a decent coffee with breakfast. The pool side rooms have inter-connecting available, which is good with small kids there's no stress of a balcony either. The hotel does offer a shuttle bus on schedule, however this time the hotel appeared fully booked so the shuttle was always booked out and unavailable, so a $5AUD taxi fare to Seminyak was required daily. You can walk but major footpath works along the way currently make it too unpleasant and it's not a nice walk as such (nothing to see along the way). Overall used to be good value, but unfortunately we won't stay again unless they improve the room quality as this time we couldn't overlook the lack of general and simple maintenance. (I killed a small spider on the wall one day, afterwards the whole baby wipe was dirty from the wallpaper, not the spider, that was my turning point that we just won't stay here again).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1112,Lovely hotel & staff,40,August 2017,Rooms were very spacious with balcony overlooking hotel. Location is a bit far out from main seminyak strip - around 30 mins walk but they have shuttles that go there (i think 4 times a day) which you should book your spot the day before. Pool is great. Breakfast was okay with lots of options.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1113,Quite and nice hotel,40,August 2017,"We visited Bali last week and we had a great experience at the Encore Seminyak hotel.
Staff very friendly and helpful. Good breakfast. Beautiful swimming pool.
The hotel offer guided tours to the main attractions in Bali and motorbike hire.
We really enjoyed our stay!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1114,Comfortable stay in a quiet area,40,August 2017,"Stayed here for one night with my wife. The hotel is around 25-30 minutes drive from the airport. The staff was courteous and also helped me with an early check-in. They do provide free shuttles to Seminyak and Kuta areas, multiple times a day but ensure you book it in advance. The food tastes good and is moderately priced.

It's quite far from the beaches and the ""commercial hub"". So if you want a quiet stay and are willing to travel to the night life spots (minimum 10-15 minutes by taxi), then Ramada Encore makes sense.

The lagoon/pool area is really beautiful and guests do spend some time in it. Overall hotel looked busy (not chaotic/noisy though).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1115,Enjoyable,40,July 2017,"My stay at the Ramada Encore was very enjoyable. The staff were super friendly and the rooms spacious and well looked after.

From our room we could step right out into the pool area.

A special thank you to Ditha Maulana Tasik (Guest Services) for her dedicated assistance.

The Ramada seemed to be a very busy hotel but we still felt it was a haven from the busy Seminyak life.

Thanks again Ramada Encore and staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1116,Excellent experience with Travel Advisor to Bali,50,August 2017,"The trip was well planned and executed trip to Bali....
1) The travel triangle executive Ms. Seema was very supportive in all aspects and helped us a lot in a friendly way. She customized the itinerary many times according to my wish without any hesitation.
2) At the Hotel we were received by Ms. Ditha Tasik and had a pleasant welcome with a complimentary welcome drink. stays, transfers and sightseeing are great n fulfilled our expectations.
3) Ms. Ditha helped us with an extra bed in our room for my kids. On one occasion we forgot our belongings at the hotel lobby and Ditha was kind enough to keep it safely in her custody and arrange it to be kept in our room.
4) On arrival their driver Mr. Matey gave us a local SIM card. He had a good knowledge of the roads and the places in Bali.

1120,Enjoy somw R and R,40,August 2017,Ramada Encore was nice but we felt just a little too far out from the General Shopping/Restaurant Precinct. Altho' a shuttle is offered and taxi's available we found we would just like to walk out our Hotel and be able to shop etc. The Staff were exceptional and the Hotel very clean.. We felt the Pool should have been closed at 7pm instead of 9pm.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1121,Relaxing Stay at Ramada,30,August 2017,"My brother and I choose Ramada Encore last minute as we had never been to Bali before and wanted a low cost hotel stay as we would be outside the hotel the majority of our time in Bali. Hence, our main motivation for choosing the Ramada Encore.
While the reviews were mixed, we generally like to decide for ourselves and weren't put off by some of the more nasty reviews we read.

Our transit from the airport to the hotel was a quick 25 minutes and we arrived via Emirates around midnight to the hotel.

The main reception area was very basic and there was only one man working the desk at this time which delayed the check in only slightly while we waited for other guests.

When it came to our turn, the man was super polite and friendly and assisted us as quickly as possible in arranging our room.

A porter assisted my brother and I to our rooms (3314 & 3315) which faces both the quiet ""town"" area and also the balcony pool facing.

Overall, first impressions were it was tidy and very basic but expected from the reviews I read.

We unpacked and headed down to the bar and pool area around 1am and found guests still enjoying which was nice to have some atmosphere. As well, we ordered some food which was ""ok"" and returned to our rooms to rest.

Overall impressions of the pool/bar area were that it was nice and seemed suitable
for adults and families alike. Honestly, we have not spent much time around there as we have been outside the hotel.

We did use the gym which is ok but very basic, and fills up once 4+ people are inside.

Also, location wise, this hotel is at least 12 minutes driving from the main city area. They do provide a shuttle bus that you sign up for that will only take you into the city center. You arrange your ride back home, which is easy enough, just be aware that all drivers will try to overcharge you.

The only negative from my end, is I found a really gross hair piece by the sink when I was brushing my teeth. As well, there appeared to be some mildew aligned along the mirror. It really grossed me out as I am really a stickler when it comes to a clean bathroom. That kind of put me off and made me wonder what else was neglected when the bathroom was cleaned.

In conclusion, the overall stay was decent. The hotel is a 3 star maximum by international standards and I most likely will not return here only because I would likely try a new location next time. Otherwise, no real issues and would recommend to travels on a budget.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1122,Unhappy returnees,10,August 2017,"Returned to this resort after enjoyable stay previously.
This time resort was over run with large group. The noise was unbearable- doors slamming, yelling throughout hotel, these guests were in pool area until 12.30am and as a result 4 sleepiness nights. We decided to cancel and go elsewhere as this group was just out of control and noisy.
We will not return to Ramada Encore whilst they are capitalising on these large groups. Unfortunately the loyal returnees are of no value at the moment- however in future once these groups drop the hotel/country and move elsewhere you will have also lost your returnees.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1123,Excellent value for money,40,August 2017,"I was comfortable, safe and very happy here. The hotel was nice with a well designed pool/restaurant area. The menu was excellent for food and bev. Staff were amazing and you could not beat the price. I would go back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

I would also like to give a special mention to Ditha Maulana Tasik (Guest Relations Officer) who made our final days in Seminyak such a memorable stay. Thank you so much for all your help and assistance Ditha, it was an absolute pleasure meeting you.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1127,Luxury hotel at affordable price,50,July 2017,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We booked room only as we weren't up in time for breakfast. 😊 staff were friendly and helpful. Food was great, the iced mocha was a favourite of mine. Portions were smaller than expected but that's probably what they should be so we were happy not to be overeating as is the case so often at home. Cocktails were good any strong. Seminyak is an easy walk from this hotel but far enough away that it's quiet at night. You can rent a scooter for 70 indonesian dollars down the street which is for nothing. The only negative I have is that the pool only gets the sun at certain hours of the day. You certainly can't sunbathe after 3.30 as the high building blocks it out.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1128,Value for money. Nice big clean room and large balcony...,40,August 2017,Value for money. Nice big clean room and large balcony. Super comfy bed and nice buffet breakfast. However If you don't like the sound of children playing this place is not for you. Lots of families. Far enough away from Kuta that it's peaceful late at night to sleep. Lovely friendly staff.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1129,Ramada Encore Seminyak,50,August 2017,"I only have good things to say about this place, lovely pool and decent rooms with very comfortable beds, amazing staff so polite and friendly also very helpful, a big shout out to the barman Made Supartha who makes the best daiquiris in Bali.

1132,tucked away from busy streets ..,40,August 2017,"situated within a housing area. hotel is fairly new and clean. out of main street/drink area. you will need to get taxi to go places. staffs are helpful, room, bath and bed decent and new. pretty cosy environment for lounge/bar drinks.. would recommend this for anyone who wants to live out of town area :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1133,Good hotel,30,August 2017,"Nice hotel staff and welcome was excellent.
Needs cleaning more the bathroom and sheets but overall very good.
Food is great for breakfast good choice.
Menu is a little over priced for what it is. Easy to get a taxi and get about i.e. Tours etc.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1134,Booked into this resort..but booking was inadvertantly cancelled by resort,30,July 2017,"As we were leaving WA airport we received an email stating our booking had been cancelled due to no show!! We replied we were on our way...When we arriving they had re instated our booking, however not a room with a balcony as we understood we had. If we wanted this we needed to pay and additional $40 per night. we refused to do this, so chose other hotel accommadation. The hotel is very nice, pool nice and restaurant appeared to be very nice. The negative here is the remoteness of hotel...at least a ten minute taxi ride to nearest shops or restaurants, and due to remoteness no taxis cruising by, would need to always accept hotel taxis at thier nominated prices.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1135,Very good,40,August 2017,"Had a 4th floor pool view room with balcony- excellent. Great bed, tv , large fridge. Pool is great and service at the restaurant / bar is good.

1137,Nice stay,40,July 2017,"I like the way that staff behaved us. They were always nice, smiling and wanted to please us. Especially housekeeping guy was perfect!
But, i do not think the dishes and the coffee cups in the restaurant are properly washed, i had to choose the less dirty one:/",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1138,GREAT VALUE,30,August 2017,"Hotel was a nice surprise and staff were extremely friendly. Pool was great. Food was pretty good too. My only complaint the rooms need a thorough clean. The wardrobe doors were dirty and the bathroom needed a goid clean. We had a fourth floor balcony room overlooking the pool which I would highly recommend. Super comfy beds, I slept like a log.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1139,Good.,40,July 2017,Far from the beach and not so near to the centre but they have free shuttles to drip to seminyak square. Breakfast spread is great. Pool is awesome and lower floor rooms open in the pool directly! The best part we got a free upgrade to a pool access room!if u planning to stay for a day before catching a flight the next day then it's totally worth it.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1140,So far from main areas service are not that good they suppose to drop us from airport but the driver didn't show up,30,August 2017,The breakfast buffet was not bad and cheap but the good in general was so bad they put Katchub instead of the read sauce for pasta the pool is good the rooms clean but smells the stuff is unprofessional but friendly.. Big problem if you have a driver from outside of the hotel no Uber allowed to come and pick you from the hotel,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1141,Return Customer,40,January 2017,I've stayed at the ramada twice this year so far and would stay there again if I were to go back to Bali. It is excellent value for money with friendly staff who remembered us on our second visit to the hotel months later. It's in a great location close to everything in Seminyak and has a great pool in the centre of the hotel. Rooms were always clean and food is good.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

The hotel is same as photo, very comfortable. the location for hotel is little far from market, but hotel provided shuttle bus. Anyway, we hope got chance to go bali again and we will stay this hotel again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1143,"Ultimate hospitality and very nice, clean and superb property giving you full return of money paid to book the hotel",50,July 2017,"Based on so many good reviews, nice pics and good location of this property, I booked it for Stay of my parents who have come from India to enjoy Bali and the hospitality of Balinese people. They were positively surprised when they arrived in the hotel quite late in evening, fully tired and were informed that there rooms were upgraded to next level of rooms. What an amazing arrival experience it is? The rooms were really very nice, modern and equipped with a kitchenette, refrigerator, extra wooden furnitures etc. The balcony is superb with a nice sofa, table and overlooking to big swimming pools and in-house greenery. The bed was very comfortable and they had a very sound and comfortable sleep throughout their stay here. Public areas were big, fresh and clean. Big swimming pool area was awesome with blue water, so many pool beds, greenery all around. Hotel has a shuttle too for dropping to any area near to hotel. They did not use the good and other outlets but passed by the restaurant and lied the smiling faces of staff. It was a very nice and memorable Stay experience for them and as per them "" they will never forget this memorable experience for balance of their life"". Now me and my wife are also excited to book and stay in this hotel during our upcoming trip to Bali...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1144,Wouldn't recommend,20,August 2017,"Me and my partner stayed here for 5 nights. I'm not normally one to moan or write reviews but I feel like I should let future guests know...

Pros
- clean room that is cleaned regularly with the option of clean towels and bedding if you want them, they are eco friendly and ask that you don't have clean towels and bedding everyday, which is so amazing they do this!
- Pool is large and the sun beds in the pool are great on hot days (if you get there early)
- There is security at the hotel which makes you feel somewhat safe
- The hotel can arrange a taxi service, but be careful as blue taxis will try rip you off, ask for a meter it is minimum 30 idr
- Gym looked lovely and clean.

Cons
- The staff don't speak very clear English often ignoring you if they don't understand (sometimes a staff member would go fetch another staff who has clear understanding of English which was fine, but rare)
- If you are due a small amount of change forget about getting it back!
- I ordered a hot dog that came out cold as if it hadn't even been cooked- when I complained to the waitress she shook her head and walked off didn't even say anything or apologise, not what you'd expect from a 4* hotel. 10 minutes later I asked her what was going to happen with my cold food her response was 'we can reheat it' there is no point in reheating food which is not cooked and covered in salsa sauce... she basically just acknowledged my food was cold walked off and didn't do anything. When I asked to speak to a manager she ignored the request and didn't get him, 15 minutes later after having a cold meal sat in front of me the manager came and offered us two free cocktails which was nice, but still I had to wait another 20 minutes for a new meal to be cooked whilst my boyfriend had finished his. Once we got the bill the hotdog was still on there, but once speaking to the manager he quickly took it off.
- There aren't many sun beds at the hotel, a lot of people will put towels down and leave the hotel to get food. There are a lot of quests in the hotel with an average of 25 sunbeds.
- When ordering food when there are a few guests in the resteraunt the waitresses will just stand there talking to each other, I had to get up and get my own menu and drinks multiple times.

Overall it is a lovely hotel with rooms and the pool, I wish we got a room with a balcony as we are smokers so going down to reception every time is annoying, but you can pay extra to upgrade. (75 AUD upgrade for 5 nights). I really think they should teach some of the staff basic English, as it leads to incorrect orders or being ignored. That being said the reception ladies were lovely, good English and will help you with whatever you need.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1145,Far from anything and terrible food,30,July 2017,"The hotel is far from any main area and beach. They offer a shuttle bus into the main centres a few times a day, which is great, but make sure to book asap as seats can fill up quickly. For price, the hotel room is okay. We experienced noise and smell of mildew in the room, but we tried to get out a lot so wasn't so bad. The breakfast is descent (eggs, pancakes, fruit, coffee, breads etc). The lunch/dinner menu food is horrible. We had a few meals here because it was too late to go to the main centre. We tried the Nasi Goreng, burger, Pad Thai, which were all horrible. The flavour was terrible and the texture was off (like it had been prepared in a dishwasher). Worse than airplane or hospital food. The pizza is the safe choice if you must eat there. The pool area is nice especially for kids who play in it a lot.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1146,Not overly impressed,30,July 2017,"I stayed here for 7 days and I was not very well looked after. I would not reccomend, the hotel did not live up to the expectations that I was told it was capable of. I had to ask more than once each time for everything. Not happy. Changing to different hotel now.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1147,Can't fault this hotel!,50,July 2017,"We arrived to the hotel extremely tired from a long journey and were so pleasantly surprised to find everything was catered for. Lovely receptionist, very nice room and 24 hr room service (we were starving!)

Pool is great for kids, and plenty of sun loungers for the adults. Enjoyed the food both at breakfast and dinner. Also had a fantastic massage in the spa. Live music was a simple singer/guitarist which was absolutely lovely to sit on the balcony and listen to.

For the price we got on this hotel we were blown away by what was offered, for those complaining it is too far from anything, they have a free shuttle to the centre of Seminyak. It would help if people did their research before booking a hotel, and complaining after.

Go for it, we loved it!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1148,"Good value, pool side room!",50,July 2017,"My wife and I had two nights here at the beginning of our honeymoon as our first stop off in Bali. The staff from start to finish were very helpful in assisting us with any requests we had. The food in the restaurant was lovely! Both breakfast and dinner we had a lovely time.

The evening of our final night we sat with a bottle of wine and listened to some live music. He was open to requests and it was great to sit and watch and listen over our dinner.

The hotel was clean and tidy from the lobby to the room, they clean the rooms on a daily basis to ensure that you're happy with your stay. We did find a live bug in a pillow case but hey you are in the middle of Seminyak.

We did find it strange when we enquired about travel arrangements to Gili T, we were directed to a gentlemen at the front, after a brief conversation he seemed very expensive and was only offering us a lift to Padang Bai so we said we would think about it. The following morning, we spoke to a wonderful lady, the Guest Relation Officer, Tita Pawestri who spoke excellent English and arranged our whole travel experience (driver to Padang, boat tickets and return boat trip and driver to our next destination Ubud), and for what we thought was a reasonable price. As first time travellers she really put our minds at ease, she also gave us her card in case we got stuck. Tita couldn't have done more, best employee by far ✅

I will say though fellow travellers I was disappointed that the hotel in the first instance sent us to someone who in my opinion was trying to overcharge us so please ask a few people before booking anything.

Overall a great stop over point for us, as it was a very short stay we did not get to venture out however we heard lots of other customers getting taxis to the nearby restaurant strip so I believe it was not far.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1149,A short walk to the centre of town,40,July 2017,"We stayed at the Ramada for 5 nights.It has an open and beachy vibe. We were over the restaurant and one of only a few rooms without a balcony. Our room was across from the elevator and we heard it clearly, as well as the doors closing loudly. The hallways are not carpeted, so there is nothing to muffle these sounds. Each evening there is entertainment in the restaurant until about 9. It is not unpleasant, but anyone putting a child to sleep could find it intrusive. The WIFI worked well as it was essential for one of us to stay in touch with work. The pool was lovely. Bed linens were good, but the towels were a bit sad. Staff were polite and very helpful. The hotel is located a bit off the beaten track but is only a10-15 minute walk to the central shopping area and there is a shuttle to Seminyak Village and the beach.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1150,Would not recommend,10,July 2017,"It is budget accommodation and I found everything was budget:
Curtains had mildew on them and holes in them.
Walls are paper thin ... You can hear everything.
The safe did not work.
Wanted extra keys for the room and were denied.
Left a key in the slot to keep the air conditioning going whilst out and came back (in the dark) to no lights etc as housekeeping had taken the key.
If you want bacon at breakfast you have to ask at the egg station and you are given a tiny helping.
Ice is NOT complimentary ..... You have to pay for it!!!
Never enough staff on reception.

Location is out of the way. Cannot walk to anything.
The lights around the pool stay on all night and can shine into your room (depending on where your room is located). We asked to have these switched off and were told they couldn't.
There are no bottle openers in your room and the staff will not supply you with one (even though the beers are delivered unopened to your room).
There is only one restaurant and the music played is offensive (at times). We stayed for five nights and did not see any live music.
Food allergies are NOT catered for.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1151,Not recommended for family with toddler.,30,July 2017,"We choose this hotel because in a booking site it said they have garden, kids club and children playground. The fact is, what so called garden is only the swimming pool area, not much space for children to play or running around in the garden. No kids club at all, only small indoor children playground which all dirty and some of them are even broken. At least the children swimming pool is awesome. The hotel is not recommended for family with small children, not much to do here. We had to go somewhere else everyday to entertain the kid. Unfortunately nothing is nearby, not even proper minimarket. You have to take taxi everywhere.

Not much variety of cheese and sausage for breakfast buffet but overall it was good. Our room was also ok. We asked a quiet room and we got really a quiet room, thank you! But the bad room is so old and dirty, definitely need an improvement or even renovation!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1152,Comfortable Stay,30,July 2017,"Stayed for 4 nights. The hotel is located off the main square and as it is a developing country the lack of pavements and numerous stray dogs makes it unwise to attempt to walk it.
The staff were friendly and helpful (managed to fix the zip to a top that I had struggled 20 minutes with). We had two rooms and were put next door to each other which was handy The rooms were a good size and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom could do with a deep clean as it always smelt a little musty. This could be to do with the fact that there is no window in the bathroom or room to let in fresh air. The walls were also thin so you could hear people talking as they walked past your room early imn the morning.
Breakfast was okay and had a good mix of dishes but it did feel a little repetitive by the last morning. We ate dinner at the restaurant most evenings as we found the food nice and decently priced. All in all a pleasant stay",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1153,Great Hotel,40,July 2017,"We loved it there let me start with the positive points:
- The staff were everywhere, opening taxi doors for you, at the reception they made photocopies of our passport and boarding pass when we needed, at the restaurant they served you right away.
- The bed is so comfortable, the pillows too. The A/C works thunder, shower was hot, new towels daily, water bottles too. We stayed in 1130 with pool access and we loved it, it is the way to go if a room is available. We pulled the curtains and there was no light coming through at all and the kids plays in the pool for a while but they don't at night time when you are sleeping so it is very quiet.
- The pool is well maintained. The hotel design have all the rooms around the big central pool, lights are on after sunset it's wonderful, you can sit on long chairs that are in a foot of water and servers come to you to take your order. You get a card to borrow pool towels that you return to get your card back, over and over again.
- Live music every 8 nights we were there, we came back to relax at the hotel early for that.
- The food was very good, you want to order at the restaurant though because it is slightly cheaper than room service for the same items. Every morning breakfast included free of charge, we loved it, it goes until 10:30, it's a massive buffet you have to included the breakfast when you book, a must.
- Fast/Steady Wifi, highlight for us, it gets ss when a lot of people uses it around 10pm to midnight.
- Happy Hour on cocktails buy 1 get 1 free (73k incl. serv and fee) everyday from 3pm to 10pm. We found the alcool content weak by taste though, anyhow they are good.
- Fitness room was small and you want to be by yourself or with your friend to be confortable, we went in the morning to run. You get A/C, towels, TV, few machines and weights and a little outdoor area, it isn't so bad.
- Location turns out to be far from it all, there is a shuttle service that brings you to seminyak square couple times a day in the afternoon for free. You return to the hotel by yourself though, blue cab was the option we preferred, make sure the blue cab has a meter otherwise he'll ask you twice as much at the end of the ride.
Overall the experience is great and I will book again there when I return to Seminyak.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1154,Great stay for Couples and Families.,40,July 2017,"A recently stayed here for 5 days and had a great time. I booked last minute for a Deluxe pool view room and couldn't be happier. Our room was 2137, on the second floor and between the two pools. Only negative side of the room is the close proximity to the kiddie pool. Since breakfast starts at 6.30am, you can often here children splashing around and playing very early in the mornings ..

Breakfast is really nice with a large spread of different foods. There is an egg station where they cook eggs to your liking. Bacon is in the back so don't forget to ask for bacon at the egg station.

The hotel does a Dinner Buffet on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturdays. The food is really nice but the spread isn't too large. Best thing about it was the all you can eat small fish and seafood station, grilled fresh just for you.

If you want to be in the hustle of everything, this hotel might not be for you. It's a bit out of the way, off of the main road, however it's so very peaceful. The hotel does provide a free shuttle service to Seminyak square and Kuta square but you've got to book in advance. Plus the hotel calls blue bird taxis for you when asked, which only costs $3-5 to go to Seminyak / Kuta.

I found the food in the restaurant to be delicious every time with quite cheap prices. I definitely recommend the Pizzas and chicken wings !!

Every staff member I interacted with was so kind and gracious so A+ for Service.
The only negative side of the hotel is the size of the gym.. It is very small, fitting maybe 4 people at a time. So only 4/5 stars due to size of gym.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1155,Very disappointing,10,July 2017,"Travelled to Bali many many times and this is the worst accommodation that I have encountered. Location is terrible, nothing within walking distance. Room, we had a supposed upgrade to a room on to the pool, they did forget to tell us that there would be lights on all night outside our room, limited sleep. DO NOT ACCEPT ROOMS 1132 or 1133, demand a change of rooms. If you have any food allergies, good luck as the staff have no idea, not necessarily their fault, more than likely a lack of training. If you order a beer to your room ensure that you have a bottle opener or strong teeth to open. There is never enough staff at reception. Very very disappointed.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1156,Couples get away,30,July 2017,"This is nice 3 star resort, very clean & good value for money. The staff were helpful & friendly. Nice large Pool. 1 main eating area/restaurant with reasonably priced meals (the pizzas are very good)

Large selection of choice for breakfast that covered all nationalities....only complaint I personally had with breakfast was lack of cereal they catered mainly for children in the cereal department only offering coco pops, fruit loops & cornflakes (no muesli).

The resort is a little further out but not really a problem as they put on a one way shuttle bus to both Seminyak & Kuta which run a couple of times a day. A taxi is only $2 -$3 AUD to Seminyak & $5 AUD to Kuta so not a problem at all.

The resort can be a little noisy at night this is due to the walls between rooms being paper thin! I could hear the person next to us snoring at night LOL!
wasn't a major problem as they didn't stay long (if you want a quiet room ask for the top floor). We had direct pool access so ground floor, but you can hear all the noise from above, so you need to weigh this up when staying there.

Seminyak beach is horrible- black sand & dirty water (sewerage)
Kuta beach is lovely - you can hire a sun lounge for approx. $5 per hr for 2 people they all come with umbrella's. The water is pretty rough so only swim in the safe areas between flags (keep a close eye on young children)

Overall this is a good budget resort with breakfast included. If your looking for luxury or more up-market this isn't the resort for you. Hope this review helps you decide.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1157,"Nice Enough, But A Bit Far Out",30,July 2017,"We stayed here for a week, and the first thing I will say is that, while possible to walk from the hotel to the main Seminyak strip, it is a Third World walk past unofficial dumps, slum shops, and wild dogs running about (I was followed by two growling canines for a hundred metres). You will need a taxi to get anywhere (cheap - 30,000 rupiah minimum fee for callout on a Bluebird taxi which aren't allowed to pick up passengers if they have just dropped someone off).
The bed is very comfortable, the room quite nice (we had a pool-facing room), the pool is nice, and most of the staff are lovely, especially Dewi and Noviak (?). The morning buffet was below average, however, unless you like beef stroganoff for breakfast. The egg Station made some of the worst omelettes I've ever had, and the coffee is American-style = awful. The gym is tiny, although it does have three running machines.
Overall it was a nice stay, but a bit far away if you want to do anything other than lie around the resort pool.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1158,Great family first trip to Bali,40,March 2017,"This hotel was great for the price. The service was friendly and welcoming, even if we did have to wait sometimes, this was only because they were busy. Staff were exceptionally welcoming towards the kids as well, which was lovely. Breakfasts were all encompassing and kept us all happy - the kids loved the different things at the pancake station each day! We travelled with friends so they managed to put us in rooms next to each other on arrival.
Our room did smell slightly damp, however given the climate and the season we visited in this could be expected. It certainly didn't linger - just noticeable when the room had been closed up all day. The bathroom area could do with a refresh but was clean enough, and the size of the room was great - myself and two kids fitted in easily. Housekeeping did forget to make up the spare bed or provide us with extra towels initially, however one call and this was quickly rectified.
The pool area is vast with a great shallow area and small ""kids pool"" section that was even heated! The kids loved this area and were happy to stay in the pool come rain or shine!
Meals at the hotel weren't cheap, but certainly cheaper than a lot of the options in town, depending on what you're looking for.
For us this was a great first experience, especially for the price.
Pro's - service and friendly staff, pool, breakfast and room size.
Cons - slightly further out of the town area, but a very cheap taxi ride if you miss the free shuttle!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1159,Great hotel,50,July 2017,"We stayed in a pool view room, this room is huge for a hotel room, the bed is massive and very comfy, theres a two seater lounge and a tiny fridge (the fridge didn't work very well, not sure if it was just the one in our room or not..?) Bathroom is on the smaller side but still ok. We had a balcony that overlooked the amazing pool. There is a gym, which is tiny but its good enough. Friendly staff, great room service but the restaurant staff are lacking, it takes ages to get a waiter to take your order, the only other negative is sound really travels in this hotel!!! But in saying that the noise is over and done with by 10pm at the lastest. Would definitely stay here again",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1160,Pleasant Stay,40,July 2017,"Friendly staff and relatively decent size rooms for the Agoda promo price. Location a bit off of Sunset main street, but pleasant walking distance to eateries, shops, cafes, etc. Pool size is good and clean. Only unpleasant experience was one morning in a rush and had hotel staff order a taxi. There was a taxi available at the lobby but the hotel staff turned it away because it was not the one they ordered. When asked about the taxi, they said that they would be charged Rp. 10.000,- if the one they ordered was cancelled. I feel that they should have asked me first if I wanted to take up the charge and catch the taxi readily available. Because of this, I lost 20 minutes waiting for the taxi they ordered....better to pay the Rp. 10.000 cancellation fee.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1161,Don't stay here!,10,July 2017,"Well, where do you want me to start? We arrived at the Hotel late at night to check in, asked if we could get a cold drink only to be advised the bar was closed and we could not get a drink. Our room was upgraded. When we went in and opened the curtains to look at the view, it looked straight into someone else's bedroom where he was laying naked on the bed. We then went back downstairs to complain. They then tried to find us another room which took over 40 minutes, only to be taken to another upgraded room where there was screaming kids. By this time it was after 1am. We arrived at midnight.
The fridge in the room didn't work, even on high, we asked for a bucket of ice and were informed there would be a cost, wifi did not work in the room and only sporadically on the balcony. We emailed the Hotel and Hotel chain directly twice about our disappointment and it was only on our last night there that we were upgraded to a suite, where the fridge and wifi actually worked. They did apologise, but it was way too late to rectify our horrible visit.
We would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1162,Worst Stay Ever,10,July 2017,"We arrived just after midnight and asked for a cold water and were advised the bar and room service shut at midnight so it was not possible. Are you kidding!!!!!! There was no mini bar in the room so we couldn't even get a drink there. The first room given overlooked a naked man on his bed next door. This was all in the first 15 minutes!!!! Terrible service.
The fridge in our room was so hot, drinks were cooler outside in the sun! We asked for this to be fixed, but it was not done. We asked for a bucket of ice and were advised there would be a charge for that!!
We went to the pool and was advised we would need a pool card. Waited 20 minutes for one before asking a passing staff member to get us one. A taxi from the Hotel charged us $15 AUD to go to Seminyak, yet it was only $3 through the local taxi service.
After all of this and despite 2 emails to the Hotel, I burst into tears at Reception and we were upgraded to a suite. At least our last night was nice and the fridge was cold!
Would never ever stay there again. Staff generally did not care about issues. Waste of money staying here.
Internet in the rooms was mostly non existent.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1167,Value for money!,50,July 2017,"Once again we decided to stay at Ramada Encore. This time as we have a 1.5year old, we upgraded to the pool access and loved it! Definitely worth our 150.000rp ($15) per room per night upgrade. The room was clean, the breakfast was good and the fact that the kiddy pool was right in front of our window was definitely a bonus. Wifi wasnt working well so if we wanted to use it, we'd have to sit outside our balcony or head out to the lobby, where most people were at with their phones. It was good to switch off once in a while though. And the fa t that We were not months middle of seminyak was also.another bonus as friday and saturday night traffic in seminyak is horrible! We would definitely come back again for sure!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1168,Very satisfied hotel,50,July 2017,"I choose this hotel for my hooneymoon,the service very good,i had little surpise in my room,,over all,this hotel recommended for your trip in bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1170,Average stay. Recommendations from our stay in Seminyak.,30,August 2016,"Stayed here July 18th to 24th 2016. The hotel itself was a average stay. Transfer could be organized better, as a lot of people wanted to take the advantage of it. Cleaning was also average. Pool area was ok. You could not bring beachtowels from the hotel, need to buy your own ones. Restaurant recommendations: Char Char and Rumours. Italian restaurant Ultimo is overestimated. Would highly recommend to take a visit a Ku De Ta Beach Club and watch the sunset. If you would like to have a sunbed in the club, reserve in advance. Otherwise they do have a sitting area where to relax without reservations. The beach down at the beachclub is nice and clean. For taxis, take Blue Birds Group who uses taxameter.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The lacking : location quite far from resto and shopping area and online taxi is not allowed but they provide shuttle bus to Kuta and Seminyak.
Bathroom need to improve as the separator for the shower to short make water falls out and the bathroom wet.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1175,Poor location,30,August 2016,"basically this hotel good building, good room, good bathroom. but location too far from main road. if you dont have car or motorcycle its trouble. not easy fiind this hotel.

1177,excellent experienced with my family,40,June 2017,"Excellent hotel of this class kept extremely clean. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff and giving some good solution for the room.

As for the hotel itself, from the kind, courteous, and friendly staff, to the meticulous, comfortable rooms, cosy common areas and especially the wimming pool- our experience was nothing less than exceptional. Far from the crowdness. Would definetely recommend to everybody! It's a true sample of excellent hospitality.

Thank you again to the owner for going just that little step extra for their guests",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1178,Nice hotel with Great ambience,50,July 2017,Value for money and nice hotel to stay in.Breakfast is wide spread.Bed and pillow is so wonderful.Staff are very friendly and the restaurant food are quite good with reasonable price.Only the shortfall during Breakfast service not so efficient need to improve in.Romantic dinner location need to change coz some children playing and swimming nearby there disturbing the dining.Overall I give 9/10 rating during my stayed.Definitely will come back this hotel when I come to Bali.Try to add some Muslim food menu is great.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

Ok",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1180,Poor location,40,July 2017,"Nice hotel with lots of facilities. Food and drinks are good at the bar and price is average. Staff are friendly and helpful.

A few things let the hotel down. We had ants in our room and the toilet continued to fill all day and night so very noisy.

Location is poor, you have to get a taxi everywhere. We walked to the beach one day but it was very dangerous and took almost an hour as we couldn't walk some roads as there were no paths.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1181,Nice hotel,40,May 2017,The hotel was nice and the staff were lovely and friendly. We got a complimentary room upgrade so we had a balcony overlooking the pool. Breakfast buffet was yummy with a good selection of food. We ate in the restaurant a couple of times and enjoyed our meals. We used the hotel shuttle bus most days to go to Seminyak square or Kuta.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1182,FAB STAY,50,June 2017,"We stayed in the Ramada for three nights as we travelled around Bali, it was a lovely stay, could not fault any part of it, room was great, staff ALL OVER were fab. v accommodating and friendly, food was lovely, fresh, good prices, pool was great. I could not complain about a single thing and would go back if I am ever in the area again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1183,Be ready to pay for things that are usually complimentry.,30,July 2017,"Initially I was impressed by the look and cleanliness of the hotel but that's where it stops.
At dinner I asked for a glass of water but was told I had to buy $$$ a bottle.
In room coffee facilities - you have to buy $$$ your milk.
Movie night is held on a big screen with two small screens in the dining room and started at 6pm BUT started with an adult movie including full nudity threesome sex (I think it was called Tale of Tales) and held the kids movie later that night. I had to cut dinner short as I was dining with my ten year old boy and it was totally inapropriate.
To use the pool table and footsill (?) you first had to have dined in the restaurant or spent money $$$ at the bar.
They don't change coins.
We had a buzzing sound with thick smoke billowing up around our bedroom door and along the balcony. We instantly panicked grabbed our passports and wallet and rang reception to let them know. They could not understand us when telling them there might be a fire or the word 'Emergency'. Very scary.
Room service over the phone - I had to speak to at least two people to have my order understood.
Pillows were lush but had a sweaty odour to them and the sheets had stains. However, the king bed was lovely to sleep on
On a good note - our first night we got to see a fire show and listen to some music.
All in all, we won't be booking to stay there again. :0(",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1184,Friendly staff,40,July 2017,"Pros:
- Large mirror in room.
- Toothbrushes/toothpaste are supplied.
- You don't need an international travel adapter.

Cons:
- When you walk in the bathroom, the sink is so big that you have to walk around it.

- The hallways are very noisy especially when trying to sleep.

- We asked the reception to make a reservation for a specific restaurant, but when we arrived to the restaurant they said there was no such booking. This was upsetting because it was for my sister's birthday.

- I received a phone call at 1am from reception telling me that ""Your husband has not paid for room service."" First of all I don't have a husband, and second of all I never ordered room service. I was really angry that my good night's sleep was ruined. I suggest this hotel creates a better system in regards to whatever it is they messed up on.

- There were ants in the room all over the bench. Each time that the cleaners came, they never got rid of the ants. So disgusting.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1185,Standard,40,June 2017,"A standard hotel in Seminyak area. The room is quite comfortable, but not spacy. The breakfast service is just standard. There is not much standing-out or lacking with the hotel. If you're looking for a 'safe' hotel in Seminyak, this could be a choice.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1186,Lovely hotel,40,June 2017,"Stayed here the first two weeks of June, we were really pleased with the hotel , as first timers to Bali was unsure after reading some reviews, the room was lovely over looking the pool, breakfast good and ate here a couple of evenings, loved the pool and sunbeds in the shallow water , yes the hotel is out the way but so glad as out of the hustle and bustle of seminyak, bluebird taxis are easy to access from reception or a hotel taxi never have to wait long , thanks for a great holiday Ramada Encore",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1187,"Room good, pool good, staff great. Food not bad, other guests children very noisey",40,June 2017,"The first week was good, the second week the Indonesian children were on holiday.
We hadn't planned on that as the schools in UK were still in session.
There was lots of shouting and screaming.
The sheets and towel were changed often.
We found that it was easier to walk every where as the traffic was horrendous, scooters on the road, on the pavements. If the traffic was blocking the road the bikes would go round over the pavements etc. It could take about two hrs to get out of Seminyak, depending on the time of day.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1188,Honeymoon stay,50,June 2017,"We stayed at Ramada Encore Seminyak for the second time recently for two weeks. This trip was for our honeymoon and to celebrate my husband's birthday ☺️ We arrived to find our room decorated with rose petals and chocolate cake! It was wonderful to be back again and see some familiar faces of staff from our last trip and new one's! Wonderful staff in the restaurant who became friends - Natalya, Dewi, Linda, Anantha - you are the best!! And Aliando and friends who look after the grounds of the hotel, beautiful people who always took the time to stop and talk with us, you made our stay so wonderful ☺️ The room we had was right by the pool, bed was amazing and comfortable as were the pillows!! Food from the restaurant was lovely, plenty of choice for the breakfast buffet too. Bar staff always smiling and even made a new cocktail that my husband likes - ask for a Mr D if you stay! Had a gorgeous candlelit dinner outside our room, husband had organised as a surprise - food was divine!! As was the service from our own waiter's (now friends), Anantha and Natalya - thank you for a wonderful night ☺️ The staff even organised a cake and sang happy birthday to my husband during breakfast on his birthday!!! We'll definitely be back again!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1191,Good value,50,June 2017,"This is my second time at this hotel. It is good value for money and 10 min walk into the main streets of Seminyak.
The hotel staff are outstanding and extremely helpful.
The property is well maintained however some of the wall plaster is falling off in some places in the room. No doubt they will fix this. We had an interconnecting room which was great which children.
The air conditioning works very well. The breakfast included is an added bonus and the restaurant at night is good value. Beds are extremely comfortable.
The pool is lovely. The internet was pretty good. I think it would depend on where your room is in the hotel. The last time I stayed it was not great but I was up on the third floor at the back of the hotel. This time I was the ground floor at the front of the hotel.
I would stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1192,Perfect for Family,50,June 2017,"We went to Bali for family holiday. We spent 4 nights in Deluxe Pool Side. The room is more spacious than other similar hotel we spent 2 nights before. The pool is only 5 steps away from our room and very ideal for us because our children can easily reach the pool. We really enjoyed comfortable bed and pillows. Love the variety of food and have delicious taste too. The restaurant is near the pool so we can have breakfast while watching the children swimming. Nice, helpful and friendly staffs. Location is great because no traffic to get here. Not more than 15-20 minutes to reach the Seminyak Square and beach. Definitely will spend our next holiday in Bali at Ramada Encore Seminyak. Thank you",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1195,Nice budget hotel,40,June 2017,This is good budget hotel with spacious rooms and good food . Breakfast was good and good variety. Main drawback with this hotel is that it's far away from market . Swimming pool facing rooms with balcony are good . Room service is bit slow . 5/10,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1196,Friendliest Hotel in Seminyak,50,June 2017,Staying at the Ramada Encore was excellent! The room was very spacious and clean. Staff were very friendly and always willing to help. Food was pretty good too. Tita at the front desk was amazing - she went over and beyond for us and we really appreciate it her hard work! Highly recommend staying here and chatting with Tita. Will return!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1197,Best city hotel in Bali!,50,June 2017,"I was losing faith in the Wyndham group, until I checked into this hotel. The customer service is unparalleled to any other hotel in Bali!

The rooms were spacious enough with a nice balcony. The pool side area has been beautifully landscaped. Key attraction is the pool beds on the water. Perfect for people who don't want to get into the pool but still want to dip their feet in the water!

Breakfast spread not the biggest but very tasty! They even had caramel sauce which I have not found in any 5 star hotel breakfast! Fresh coffee from 3 different coffee machines.

We opted for the barbecue night on Saturday and the entertainment alone was worth the price! From fire jugglers to traditional dancers to a live band.

The staff always called us by our names. I thought we were special, until I spoke with another guest and they said the same. Which only means the staff makes an effort to know everyone by their names! Haven't had that for a longtime...not just the reception staff but staff everywhere.

Not sure how they do it... but it was an amazing stay! Although this was the cheapest hotel we were booked in during our 15 days visit to Bali, I must say it turned out to be one of our best stays yet!

Will definitely come back again! If you want to experience the Semniyak nightlife, this the best hotel to stay in.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1198,Beautiful Hotel,50,June 2017,"We have stayed at the Ramada Encore 4 times now. The ròoms are clean and spacious, staff are very friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast is lovely. Would highly recommend this hotel. Great value for money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1199,Room was nice but very daily cleaning. Restaurant very poor...,10,June 2017,Room was nice but very daily cleaning. Restaurant very poor some meat was raw. First 3 food or drink transactions were wrong charging for more than order or short changing us. Staff were friendly enough. Very remote location. Told by staff not to walk around the area after dark for safety reasons.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1200,Average Hotel in Poor Location,30,June 2017,"Stayed at Ramada Encore for 8 nights in June 2017. Booked a Superior Room with Balcony - Found out on arrival that you cannot access the balcony in these rooms. Staff were generally ok, although food was poor and overpriced. Location wasn't the best but the hotel does offer a free shuttle bus into Seminyak a couple of times a day. The room itself was average and nothing like the pics on their website. Bathroom was dirty and mouldy. WI Fi worked half the time. Overall cleanliness around the hotel was poor. Personally, I wouldn't stay there again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1201,We enjoyed our visit.,40,June 2017,We stayed here for a week. The staff were amazingly friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Especially Dewi at breakfast she remembered our name from day 1!!!Breakfast was average for choice and restaurant food was ok. Hotel is nice but looking very tired .Stayed in standard room which wasn't huge but big enough. Big bed which was sooo comfortable. Clean all except shower recess could do with good scrub. All in all I would rate our stay a 6/10.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1202,I never want to go back,10,June 2017,"We had a pool access room, there was mould on the blinds. The sheets were stained. The staff were rude.
I was walking through the restaurant (as you do to get to the reception) and there was puddles of water just in the middle of the restaurant. I slipped twice on two seperate days. And the second time, not one staff member came and asked me if I was alright.
Some of the pool towels had small holes in them. The 'kitchenette' is a kettle. The staff do not realise how many people are staying in the room and don't put enough towel. They didn't sweep the floors and never gave us toilet paper roles.
The maximum amount you're allowed to put on the room (food, drink etc from the restaurant) is $200aud. We were only allowed to put $60aud on and then we were cut off. It made us feel like we were not trusted and that we'd just do a runner on that bill.
Very disappointed.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1203,Nice hotel with nice pool,40,June 2017,The property was very good eith good facility such as breakfast and also nice pool but some of the staff at swimming pool they are very complicated.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1204,Big difference from over a year ago,20,June 2017,"The best thing are the rooms: very comfortable and spacious. The pool is cool too!

I called the hotel to ask some information before my arrival, highlighting I was going to stay with a senior citizen that needs special walking aid due to her age, therefore, I needed more information in regards their connecting rooms. When I contacted the hotel the agent failed to provide details information and they seem in such a hurry to hang up.

Upon check in, the reception told me that they could not find my reservation. After a while, she said that I could not get a connecting room and if I wanted that, I have to pay more, even though the agent said the type of room will have the connecting room.

F&B was very disappointing as they service seems that they wanted the customer out as soon as possible, so even I have not even finish my breakfast I am being harassed with the bill, very unprofessional and rude.

Comparing to my stay over a year ago, the overall experience is declining. I could see it that Ramada Encore will not be a place that I would recommend anymore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1205,Will come back if they can get rid of the garbage smell.,30,June 2017,Breakfast is average. The family suite no 1421 was great except the disguisting garbage smell came out from under the kitchen sink.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1206,June Visit,30,June 2017,"We stayed here for 4 nights in June 2017 and have not a bad word to say about the hotel. The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean, beds and pillows are extremely comfortable. Would definitely recommend requesting a balcony room, that's the only thing we regretted. Hotel provides a shuttle service in to Seminyak square and Kuta, free of charge, which makes a difference if you can utilise it. Would recommend hotel definitely, young or old a great stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1207,Good value!,30,June 2017,We came here after a bad experience at a different hotel and we're greeted to lovely clean rooms and a smiling face at the desk. The hotel is nice. The only issues I had was the food in the restaurant (wouldn't recommend - get a taxi to a restaurant) and that the sun doesn't stay on the pool area for much of the day at all due to it being surrounded by tall buildings. Other than that it's a good cheaper option if you're wanting to sightsee / go on day trips!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1208,Good hotel,40,June 2017,"We were at this hotel in June 2017, friendly staff, good breakfast, nice rooms food great and entertainment good.Nice rooms, the only drawback for us was it is to far from shops and beach however the hotel has a shuttle bus that takes you into Seminyak. Overall a very nice hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1209,Value and Clean,40,May 2017,A special thanks to Tita for making us feel welcomed. A great ambassador and exceptionally friendly receptionists at the Ramada Hotel . This was place clean and functional. Only gripe was coffee was very weak as result of cheap product. Food was great and we will stay again. !!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1210,Ms Jazzicharm,50,June 2017,"Ramada Encore Seminyak is a very affordable hotel that I would recommend highly, especially the lovely, polite and respectable staff - namely Tita that was always looking for ways to accomodate hotel veterans.
The food at the hotel restaurant is delicious along with the evening entertainment. A four star hotel that deserves five stars.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1211,Love this hotel sooooo much,50,June 2017,"We actually paid for superior room from Traveloka. But because their superior was sold out so they gave us double room. The receptionist (mbak Tita) was really nice. I really enjoyed my stay in Ramada Encore. I love the swimming pool so much. They gave us two extra towels in swimming area. And the pool was huge. I really love spending time in the pool. It was more relaxing than the beach because it had already high season in Bali when we visited. I also love the room, everything was perfect.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1212,Just Awesome,50,June 2017,Great place to stay. Our family had a wonderful holiday staying at the Ramada Encore. Wonderful staff always smiling. We will be definitely be back on our next holiday to Bali. The staff got to know the kids by name very quickly.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1213,Lovely hotel,40,June 2017,"Hotel was lovely, great rooms. Staff were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. Pool was lovely, slightly cold, but if weather was warmer this wouldn't have been an issue, daughter loved it. Food was good.

1214,Loved our stay in this gorgeous hotel,50,June 2017,"Beautiful room overlooking pool, entertained and diner is ist class, loved the Nasi goreng the best I have ever had, close enough with a pale blue blue bird cab,too semiyak and Beaches, pool is very clean, this hotel very child friendly, The staff bend over backwards to make your stay a great memory! HAPPY HOUR is fantastic cheaper than in seminyak.Beautiful shade if you need it, stunning gardens, night it looks like fairy land. They always have special nights, with bands etc, will always stay here and rooms are cleaned to perfection thankyou..",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1215,Holliday,40,June 2017,The hotel is nice and modern The main staff are very helpful and friendly unfortunately the hotel was out of the way from any shopping and restaurants and entertainment,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1216,Bali vacation,40,June 2017,"Nice hotel with well appointed, spotlessly clean rooms. Staff are friendly and very helpful with all queries, sightseeing trips and little anecdotes on Bali. The restaurant by the pool with its bars is a great place to chill!!

It's a distance though from the main Seminyak area but the shuttle service to Seminyak square is great to get into town and then you can walk around and explore.
Uber as a means to get around is fantastic!!

I would definitely stay there again!!

Thanks Ramada encore for a lovely 4 day stay!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1217,Not so bad,40,July 2016,"All staff didn't seem to be friendly except one staff who allowed us for late check out. But it was new and clean. Breakfast wasn't bad. The location was not that convenient. However,the massage was the best ever in Bali. Cheap and relieving.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1218,Relaxing hotel away from the hustle and bustle.,50,June 2017,"The lagoon pool is cool in temperature. It is 1.2 metres deep. Lots of sun and shade.
The deluxe room is spacious and the bed is comfortable. Our favourite place was the balcony overlooking the pool and restaurant.
The food is excellent and very affordable. Local dishes start at 50 000 rupiah. We stayed for 10 nights, and ate here at least once, sometimes twice a day, not including breakfast, which is also excellent. At breakfast, lots of variety, with different dishes each day. Coffee is available at breakfast, but I would recommend buying an espresso, cappuccino, flat white, whatever your preference, at the bar for 30 000.
But the best thing about the place is the staff. Always friendly and smiling and ready to help. A few names that I can remember, Dewi, Gita, Linda at the restaurant. Tita at reception helped to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable. If we had a question, she had the answer.
Free shuttle to Seminyak and Kuta. But be aware that the shuttle goes to Seminyak and then to Kuta. So if you want to see the sunset at Kuta, catch a taxi.That will cost about 50 000. The shuttle leaves at 1700, but sometimes the shuttle doesn't get to Kuta until after 1800. You've missed the sunset.
This is our 2nd time here, and we look forward to staying here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1219,Excellent,50,June 2017,"I have not one bad word to say about Ramada Encor Hotel
The staff were excellent friendly and professional
The room for the rate was excellent wiyh a balcony of the pool.
The food was good just a little disappointed about the buffet dinner on my last night the food was cold and the dessert was very disappointig so if that could be improved then I rate it a 4.5 out of 5",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1220,Beautiful hotel unfriendly staff,10,June 2017,"This hotel is an extremely beautiful property however the staff is a bummer! Its just been a day here and we have had multiple issues which is still ok however the staff is very rude and is not at all considerate towards the inconvenience a guest is going through. We booked majority of our stay in bali at this place assuming this could be a nice base however thats not the case.
Indeed good value for money but if you come here do not expect cutomer service!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1221,Comfortable stay,30,June 2017,"Hotel is about 45 mins car ride from the airport. The Security staff made us feel safer staying there as they made efforts to check all vehicles entering the hotel. Concierge/Bell Hop and Front Desk staff were all very efficient. Room was spacious and the large bed was bigger than the usual king size bed. Our room was on the 2nd floor and for those who love swimming, it is better to get rooms on the ground floor that has direct access to the pool. The bathroom was quite run down; it is time for the management to refurbish at least the bathroom. The bath towels were quite worn out and Housekeeping forgot to replenish shower gel, shampoo and towels for one of the days. The connecting room door frame was very dusty. The atmosphere in the cafe and swimming pool area was cosy and nice. Breakfast items were good and tasty. Hotel is less than 10 mins taxi ride to Seminyak Square. Hotel provides free shuttle to Seminyak Square and Kuta at designated timings and it is for drop off only. Hotel is not within walking distance to the beach and you will need to take a taxi to everywhere you go. I would choose a better location for my next trip to Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1222,First world problems,40,June 2017,"Pros: beautiful and accomodating hotel room, gorgeous pool and pool area (photos don't do justice), great selection for breakfast, cold air con, wifi quite consistent with strength, free shuttle bus times, room cleaning at no extra price,free drink token

Cons: location,,,,although nice and somewhat rural for seminyak it was difficult to get prompt transport from taxis when not wanting to be overcharged by hotel provided transport outside shuttle bus times, majority of staff did not understand good english/few incidents of strong confusion// im still not sure if we can book food to the room after speaking to two people , provided a menu for room service which was deceptive of price and content (apple Streudel w icecream but it ""actually doesnt come with icecream anymore because we changed the menu so icecream is charged extra"" okkkk.....u just sent me up this menu, free drink token was a strawberry ice tea - Bintang would have Been nice but at 45k i dont think it would be kind to them, breakfast set up spread over two big rooms opposite side of each other - very overwhelming prior to morning coffee",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1225,"Having been to Bali before, in choosing a 4 star resort we were sure we were going to get great service",30,June 2017,"We booked and upgraded 4 pool access rooms, top of the selections to accommodate 8 guests. Apparently before the upgrade the booking included breakfast afterwards only two rooms included breakfast not the others- go figure! Breakfast was inappropriate anyway - penne marinara on one serving.This property is run down, tattered towels that never see fabric softeners, rooms with buzzing mosquitoes at night and waking with bites. I needed to tell them to make up our room this was not done otherwise, empty bottles and coffee cups on our patio area were not cleared, the stray resort cat ate the chicken wings leftover on the patio table. Service usually associated with resorts of this rating was totally lacking. We would not return.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1226,Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak. good hotel with average service,30,May 2017,"A very mixed opinion about the hotel. Really a good hotel with lot of potential. But management is poor
The good bits:
location is perfect as it is slightly away from the crowded area and very quiet. Around 2km away from main seminyak area
You could easily walk around the hotel in the evening or night without people troubling you. Nice wind and sunlight all the time.
hotel itself is very spacious especially lobby, pool area etc. even outside is also very open and give you a nice feeling.
Offers free drop to Kuta beach and seminyak square daily and you have to book the seat in advance by calling reception.
Nice big swimming pool and restaurant/bar area around the pool. In-house dining is also available even late night.
Snooker table for people who buy drinks from their bar worth over 50K IDR
Breakfast is kind of average. Not according to the star status.
If you get out of the hotel and walk towards the main road. there are some shops and cafes which is cheaper for food and especially alcohol.
Bar prices are extremely high compared to some other hotels. But you can’t blame as this must be a 3 or 4 star property. So may be price was kept in accordance to that. Just walk down the road 100 metres away and you will find shops who sell the beers for half price.
Majority of the staff are good but it’s very difficult to make them understand what you are saying.
BAD BITS
Our room was not good. Spiders and ants all over the place. Then they woke us up in the middle of the night to enquire what the problem with the room is. Again next day someone came and sprayed some insect repellent and cleaned the room Rooms are not insulated properly as you can hear lot of noises from outside. Some sort of refurbishment going on in the next room and it was a nightmare to sleep. Their housekeeping or storage room was next to us and the noise of trolleys and staffs were unbelievable. When we enquired about changing room the only option available was to pay more and upgrade.
The reception should make it very clear to other guests who checks in late night to be quiet. I had to wake up in the middle of the night and request the guests to stop shouting. The balcony is completely closed and can’t be opened. Don’t know the point of having them in the room then. Wi-Fi connection is terrible.
The worst part is taxi service. There is security personals in the front gate who refused entry to private taxis, uber, grab etc. They even threatened the driver and asked him not to come again. Unbelievable experience. Never heard a rule like this before in my life. There were some other guests also who really got upset with this behaviour. So we tried to find out what exactly is happening and the reason behind this is hotel would like to use their taxi services which is unbelievably expensive. At least 4 times more than what a normal uber or grab services offer. Just for e.g. a trip to the airport from the hotel costs between 30-35k Indonesian rupiah and the hotel taxi would charge 150k flat.
Now I am not sure whether the actual owners are aware of this or this is just an arrangement with the hotel management and local taxi people. It was the other guests who suggested we just walk out of the hotel and then book the taxi service on uber /grab then it’s easy as that’s what they are doing. The security will allow these people to drop the guest but pick up is denied. Since this is away from the main road probably hotel thinks they can get away with these kind of behaviours. Don’t expect the reception staff to intervene as they all are in this game. When we enquired about this there was a standard reply that we can use their taxi service instead. If you can’t get uber or grab then go for bluebird tax as they are bit more cheaper than hotel ones.
We find out that later this is a common practice in Indonesia as local taxi drivers hate uber and grab. We stayed in other hotels and none of them had issues like this. All in all a not a very good experience even though the hotel has a good potential to make it better",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1227,Not as good as the rate the staff is not friendly.,30,June 2017,"Staff only friendly to the foreign guest. The bedsheets has a lot of stains.The breakfast wasn't as good as the review. Won't come to this hotel again next trip. At first I booked pool access room, but the receptionist give me the pool side room. And when I asked her, she insisted that it was the right room. After I pushed her, he said that the room was full and promised me to give the room the other day. So, not really recomended.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1228,“I ♥ You Ramada Encore - You Always Get 5 Stars From Me”,50,May 2017,"I travel to Indonesia 2-3 times a year and this definitely is my preferred hotel of choice when in Bali. Time and time again, Ramada Encore fails to disappoint and are a A++++ 5 Stars in my rating.

Don't sift through all the reviews, just book! You truly won't regret your decision. Ramada Encore has the nicest buffet breakfast option, very well trained and attentive staff, lovely appointed rooms and a fantastic pool area.

A special thank you and mention to Arik Sugiarta the Front Office Manager for going above and beyond with my previous 2 x room booking last month (May 2017). You are a great pleasure to deal with.

1229,Lovely,40,June 2017,Lovely staff lovely hotel. A little bit out of the way but very relaxed. Feel safe. Room service could be a bit quicker late at night. Bit of sun chasing needed but definitely recommend it! First time here but definitely come back,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1230,"''Great Staff,breakfast geared for chinese overall not too bad''",30,April 2017,"Firstly the staff at this hotel were lovely and friendly always a good morning and a smile. The hotel is a good 45 minute walk from the beach or the shops which was disappointing at first , the hotel is situated in a quite area, I must admit it was nice to get away from all the traffic and people of central Seminyak at the end of the day .The hotel does provide a free bus but only twice a day final pick up at 5pm which is too early we felt.
Taxis will cost you 5oo,ooo to the beach one way this price can vary depending on your bartering skills we ended up hiring a scooter for two weeks but due to traffic not to be recommended.
The included breakfast was more geared for the Chinese and Korea's with noodles and different oriental dishes available , but if you wanted something more conventional the fried eggs and omelette were made to order taking as long as ten minutes to make due to demand, bacon was also available as long as you are prepared to wait..
Don't try the buy one get one free cocktails at the bar as they are rubbish just a glass of ice and hardly any alcohol in them better off getting one at normal price far better drink.
The pool area was nice and well kept although due to the design of hotel the sun disappeared after 2pm leaving whole pool area in the shade. The pool although covering
a large area was only around 4 feet deep making it more of a paddling pool.
The room was a nice size we had a balcony which we had to pay an extra £100 for on arrival ,please note some rooms don't have a balcony and over look the front of the hotel with no view. The bathroom was tired looking and could have done with a make over ,the shower head keep slipping down the rail so I ended up tying string around it to keep it at a decent height for showering. During our two week stay sheets not changed as regular as I would have liked and towels were past their best being frayed around the edges.
The TV had three good movie channels and the free wi fi in the room came in handy to keep in touch with home.
The corridors to the rooms resemble those of a prison block not very appealing.
I think my rating of average is a fair rating for this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1231,Second Time and More To Come,50,June 2017,"This is the second time I am visiting this hotel.
Apart from having great facilities and location, the staff in the hotel is very helpful.

I am lucky to know Tita from our first trip and she has taken care of us very well.
(One of the main reasons I came back )

Great service by staff and good hotel.

I would definitely recommend staying here if you are in Seminyak.

Keep up the good work Ramada Encore",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1232,Not a nice hotel,10,June 2017,"Situation far away from everything and room smelt like cigarette smoke, damp and sewage. Not nice! Toilet seat was broken, rooms were filthy, air conditioning broken, towels discoloured and fraying...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1233,Majority of staff very good but the bar staff are pretty average.,40,June 2017,"Rooms are cleanish but smelt of damp and the bed sheets were stained. One of the pillows also smelt like sick.
Reception staff were very good and helpful but the bar staff were average messing up the bills and seen to make cocktails with bare hands not using tongs. Yuk!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1234,"Great Hotel, Delicious Food, Friendly staff",50,May 2017,"Great hotel with comfortable bed, clean room, excellent service, very friendly and helpfull staff, fast when needed.

1235,Amazing stay! Very helpful!,50,June 2017,"Right from the start the hotel staff made so us incredibly welcome. Dewi welcomed us with the welcome drink and then everytime we came to the restaurant and had impecible service understanding. The service was five star and a special thankyou to Tita also on reception who made sure all dietry needs were met and even had the executive chef meet us every morning to prepare my wife's breakfast! On arrival we got up graded to the fifth floor executive pool view room which was very comfortable. It made the stay extra special having such a comfortable couch in the room and a lovely view over the pool. The pool is great for all ages and having the pool recliners in the shallows was a great place to chill out during the day. The hotel is in a quieter location and you can walk to Seminyak in around 15 minutes and you can take the hotels shuttle or get a taxi for around $3 Aussie. The gym could to be better with more room to do yoga and pilates and the wifi is up and down. But still very usable :). The beds are a little firmer so depending on what you like you can request a bed topper which is best to do before you arrive. Overall for price, this hotel offers five star service and is great value for money. Thankyou to all the staff who made for a lovely stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1236,Not to good,20,May 2017,"I only stay one day in this hotel, and a little disappointed because wifi connection is very bad and towel in bathroom not to clean plus the water flow in the sink is clogged.
And I can't order online taxi in here...",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1238,Great pool and dining area,40,May 2017,This place has a beautiful pool and an even better dining area which is amorously lit at night. The live music was par excellence. The staff is polite and helpful. However we found the food just average. Also the rooms we booked online turned out to be very small and without balconies unlike the pictures we saw online (they were higher tariff rooms). However its a good budget place to put up.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1239,Facility is old and service so so,20,May 2017,"Location a little out but still walkable to convenient stores. However facility is old and tired and not well maintained. Sheets and pillows are stained. Shower and sinks are choked and flows slow.
But you pay for what you get.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1240,"Great Hotel for families, and friendly staff",40,May 2017,"We stayed in a family room, and it was sooo big and a very comfortable room. I would stay here again. The only let downs is that the food and drink service is very slow. And the price of a massage compared to other places in Bali is on the expensive side. $30 aus. But great pool area and awesome rooms. Staff are very good and friendly.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1241,nice hotel,50,May 2017,have just had a lovely stay here staff are fabulous buffet breakfast catered to all tastes we had a pool side room and our first room was near the front of the hotel it was lovely but could get a bit noisy as it was also near the kiddie pool we asked to change rooms to one down the back there was no problems with changing and it was a lot quieter the lighting in the rooms wasnt the best if you want to read but otherwise highly recommend i would stay here again,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1242,A perfectly run hotel!,40,May 2017,"Enjoyed this hotel so much that we had to extend the holiday one day! Staff were helpful, attentive and extremely polite. Always with good mornings and smiles.

The hotel is a definite taxi journey from the shops, beaches and bars - but even that is only a few pounds each time. And the hotel has a shuttle service.

Would definitely stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

From the moment we arrived at Bali Airport we were greeted by Ramada Encore's shuttle to take us to the resort. Everybody greeted us with open arms.
We were given a complimentary cool drink, our luggage were taken up to the rooms which were spotless.
Our stay at Ramada Encore was a very memorable one and very highly recommended to any family with kids.
Great food and very friendly efficient service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Pros:
1. Fast check in

Cons

1246,Excellent Service,50,May 2017,I booked this hotel for family members and upon checking in they were delayed as the rooms weren't ready. As a result they upgraded all three rooms which was fantastic. When checking out they advised all three rooms would be upgraded again when we checked back in a few days later after a short stay in Nusa Dua. Couldn't fault the service or the hotel.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1247,Fabulous value for money,40,March 2017,"We stayed here for a week an a half and had a great stay.

Staff are friendly and rooms are nice. Balconies are really big- we paid for one facing the pool which I would recommend. Room is nice and clean.

The pool area was nice but only a handful of sunbeds, I wouldn't recommend the hotel if you wanted to lay by the pool all week.

The hotel was a little out of town but only 5 mins in a taxi and really cheap!

We also stayed with breakfast which was average - as a vegetarian the options were limited.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1248,Good place to stay!,40,May 2017,Room was money's worth and location was only a 5min down from Seminyak Square. Free shuttle was very convenient but seats were limited. Taxi ride less than $5 AUD to Kuta and Seminyak which was good! Employees of the hotel were very helpful and service was great. Poolside room was good with direct and easy access to the pool. Free buffet breakfast was nice every morning but dinner at the restaurant was average tasting.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1249,Smiley faces hotel.,50,May 2017,Everything okay. pool very very good and big. This hotel is beautiful for relaxing. This area is very silence. I'm relaxed so much. Personnels very warm-blooded people. also I will never forget the girl in the reception. Thank you so much.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

1255,Good place for value!,40,May 2017,"Overall pretty happy with our stay at ramada. Smaller rooms but it was fine for a few nights. Bed was really nice, bathrooms a bit small but clean and new etc. buffet breakfast was very good. Good pool etc. very busy place however for breakfast etc, many bus loads of Asian tourists etc. however I would recommend as price was so good. Pretty good location, just hire a scooter (like you should everywhere in bali) if able and it's a 5- 10 min ride to beach/mall/ famous areas to eat and shop. Only issue was with Uber. Like most big hotel/resorts in Bali the gangs control the taxis etc so Uber cannot pick up only drop off, which means you only have to walk 5 mins down street to meet you Uber. U we is VERY cheap though, would highly recommend if going between airport /seminyak etc or seminkyak /uluwatu",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1256,Worth the cost,40,May 2017,"We stayed at the Ramada for three nights with poolside access, and I was happy with the hotel in general.

The rooms were cleaned daily and were modern and atheistically pleasing. Bed was comfy (maybe too comfy because I kept sleeping whenever I was on it!)Pool was nice , refreshing and clean and at night was lit up with lights.

Staff were all terrific, very accommodating and friendly. Food was good, buffet breakfast was different every day. The hotel even had cultural shows on certain nights, which I am told were very good.

It's true the hotel is a bit out of the way, but it has transport services and that will take you anywhere you want to go anyway, so it's not a big deal.

The only con that I can think of is that there was not enough squirrels

Worth a revisit and would recommend for sure!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1257,Seminyak in May,50,May 2017,"Amazing pillows, I had such great neck support during my 3 nights here. Such good bed for a great sleeping in time. However it is a bit noisy from some of the late night check in tourists, especially a whole group of middle age people.

1259,Below Average Property,20,May 2017,"The place looks great on the website with great packages - I had a poolside room which was ok in size and room a little tired looking- needs better upkeep and found it to be dirty-
Pool is good, staff are friendly. The worst experience was the quality of food is absolutely terrible- the Buffet breakfast is bland and I suspect made with low quality foods - for example i'm in Indonesia and I ordered chicken Satays and Gado Gado- how can anyone screw it up? They must of used cheap and nasty commercial peanut sauce- chicken undercooked and the Gado Gado was soggy! Ordered room service Pizza and supermarket frozen pizza would be better- orders NY Burger and fries- looked sloppy and hardly any fries! The breakfast egg chef was a disaster creating sloppy omelettes- he could not even make poached eggs. The worst thing I saw was the handling of food which was unhygienic - staff using hands not tongs or gloves to put sliced bread on buffet- I mentioned this to one staff and he came back with my hands are clean??? ( after watching him touch dirty plates- really?) he apologized next day and wore gloves which he used for touching everything- no idea!!! )
Plates and cutlery dirty.
Also location is kind of far from Main Street however taxis are available-
I ate out for all meals!
In all my years or travelling I have never seen a hotel charge for Ice!!! 10000 IDR for a small bowl or 20000 IDR for ice bucket???? Seriously who charges for ice? Shame in you Ramada Encore !",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Shopping and restaurants (Jalan Kayu Aya street) is only 5-10 minutes with a taxi, but it is a longer walk - you can rent bicycles at the hotel. Free shuttle ""bus""(car) from hotel to different places like Kuta and Seminyak Square. A room with pool view and a balcony is definitely preferable. Had a nice stay here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1262,Great pool for swimming laps,40,April 2017,April is a great time of year to visit Bali. This hotel had a good size swimming pool 60 metres in length give or take a few metres. Breakfast was included with a good range of food. Rooms on the second floor were a little noisy with foot traffic and smokers ignoring the hotel rules. Free shuttle to Kuta and Seminyak was a bonus. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We had a great stay.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1263,A Family Friendly Hotel,40,April 2017,"We enjoyed our stay at Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak. My hubby and I and our 20 months old twins had a good time staying here. We chose the 3 bedrooms condotel and we got upgraded from pool view room to pool access room. My babies got very excited because they easily access the pool from the balcony.

The hotel area is not big, but it makes the atmosphere more friendly and homy. They have popcorn and gelato stalls at the pool side. On the weekend when we stayed there, they had night entertainments at the restaurant which is located also by the poolside.

The staffs are very friendly. They knew from my ID that i was having a birthday, so they decorated my bed in the main bedroom and I got a surprised cake that they put inside the fridge.

One thing that they should give more attention to in this hotel is mosquitos! We had to spray the room several times and though we had told the reception to ask the staff to spray the room while we were out, they seemed to forget it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

We booked a family room for 4 adults and we could've easily fit 2 more people into the room! It was huge! Had a lovely big sitting room/kitchen area, 2 double rooms and a twin room. Great balcony over looking the pool too. The only down side - the slow bar staff! Ordered drinks while waiting on a taxi to arrive and after 10 mins they still hadn't started our order.

The food was lovely, rooms super comfortable and quiet with good airconditioning and we loved the view over the pool. Happy hour was well priced! And even just lying around the pool was great. It didn't seem like there was an absolute heap of people staying there so it was nice and quiet. And a quick taxi ride to get anywhere (you wouldn't walk into the township from this resort). For the price it was an excellent hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1268,LOVED this place,40,October 2016,"I stayed at this hotel in October 2016 with my sister, young son and a friend. I had read previous reviews that talked about the hotel being dirty. We were pleasantly surprised to find this NOT to be the case.The hotel staff were fabulous, friendly, courteous and very accommodating.
Initially we were slightly disappointed as the location is a little way out of the hustle and bustle of Seminyak but in NO time we were grateful for this as the cost from Seminyak Square to our hotel was only a few dollars.
We enjoyed the satay most days for lunch while we cocktailed around the pool and we headed out for adventures during the later and cooler part of the day. We left our hardly touched duty free booze to one of the lovely staff members.
I would stay here again, easily. The pool was lovely. The buffet breakfast was one of the reasons I wanted to stay here and was not disappointed. The lady who done the eggs was adorable. Very sweet and just had a lovely calm nature. Her eggs were amazing! For those that like bacon, all you have to do is ask.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1271,Beware...!!,30,April 2017,The location is a bit of from hustle bustles of seminyak. If you use public transport then you're in trouble. Hotel facilities is good except that their kids facilities are no longer there. Only few toys near lobby. There's an Xbox but you have to buy something first to use it whichs not an ideal family hotel. Staff are helpful and willing to listen to your complaint but there are many choices of hotel closer to the heart of seminyak and I'll pass this property next time. Not family friendly imo...:(,Primera Hotel Seminyak

1274,Hotel or location,40,April 2017,"Great hotel for service and ambience. nothing was too much trouble. great SPA area on top floor. SPA team were great. Only downside is hotel not truly in Seminyak. It's down the end of a dingy road away from town which is its only set back. They do a 3 times a day shuttle into Seminyak or Kuta, but no return. If you want to just kick back and get Away from the world for a few days then it's ideal.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1275,Nice small hotel,30,April 2017,"We stayed here 2 nights...the room was in good size..with all the amenities..however it needs better upkeeping..the bathroom was not properly cleaned..we found some hair on the counter top.. towels were in poor condition..not white anymore..and lots of loose threads hanging..it really shouldn't be used anymore..also..some mosquitos in the room..we were so careful of not letting the door ajar..but still got some mosquitos inside..at least we killed 3..and still some flying around..ww asked for electric mosquito repellent but they didnt have it. So we ended up sprayed our room ..and waited outside for an hour...
The pool was very nice..but it only opened at 8 am..which we found too late...we prefer to swim before breakfast..the breakfast buffet had plenty of choices...but taste was nothing special...very average...we tried some cocktail at night...Classic Margarita and Pinacolada...taste below standard...a beer would be better...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1276,"Tiny over priced ""superior rooms""",20,March 2017,"In all the years I have been going to Bali this was one of my worst Hotel experiences, I paid over $60 for a ""superior room"" that was on the 5th floor, room was very small and dirty, looked like blood all over the curtains. Balcony was nice but could not get to it as the entryway was a solid sheet of glass, so only fresh air was a little window that open a couple of inches at best.

They were happy to upgrade me for another $50 a night. I booked another room for over silent day over $300 and they decided to upgrade me then, new room was about what i would expect to pay for that type of accommodation in bali.

Pool was nice but as a bigger guy I get embarrassed and always swim in boardies and tee shirt, got kicked out of pool so embarrassing, and young fella upset. Booked out day early, as was poring rain and as he was on motorbike i said watch tv until rain stop hand in key then come meet us. The minute I walked out the door they were calling the room ,and knocking on the door, he got scared and left.

The hotel is miles off the beaten track, there is nothing in walking distance, so unless you have motorbike or car you are stranded.

wifi ok on 5th floor ...basically non existent on 2nd floor.

Overall experience, terrible I could never recommend this property to anyone.

Management do no reply to this as I kept you informed from day one I was unhappy, and you did not care. You should talk to some of your guests there were a lot of unhappy people I spoke to.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1277,Spectacular service.,40,March 2017,"Professional work by all the staff members, the bartenders creating amazing drinks and the breakfast being very nice, I would definitely stay back here and yes it may not be directly next to the shops, but the peace and quiet is what you want and to enjoy Seminyak Square, it is a very in-expensive trip to the clothing shops. Local milkbar is also a benefit!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1278,Bad experience,20,April 2017,"When i saw all pictures on the internet, i had high expectation with luxurious rooms and pool which were nice, but when i entered to the room i was given a room that has not been prepared with a bed without sheet and no pillow cover. It makes me disappointed because it is not in accordance with expectation. But fortunately with friendly staff and nice pool that my
disappointment is reduced. So i give 2 stars for staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1279,A great little oasis,50,February 2017,"Our stay in the Ramada Encore was fabulous! The hotel is beautifully decorated and the amenities that you get at this price point are unreal. The hotel rooms are very spacious, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was amazing! The pictures of the pool area do not do it justice and it was definitely the highlight of our stay just laying out around the pool.

The breakfast offered each morning had a wide range of options, probably the most I've seen after traveling for 3 months and all of it was delicious! The food and drink offered at the restaurant was a little pricier but that didn't stop us from having at least one meal there every day because it was so delicious and there was a wide selection to choose from. The best part of our stay had to be the staff. My friend was ill during our stay and they were extremely kind in helping us to find a doctor and checking on her to make sure that she was ok, this was greatly appreciated by both of us.

The hotel is a little ways out from a lot of the main attractions and clubs but to us it was a little oasis after spending all day out on the beach or at the clubs in the area. The hotel does offer a shuttle service several times a day to the main areas and the taxi rides, if you choose to take them are not unreasonably priced, just make sure you get a real blue bird taxi and not the knockoff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1280,Great stay for great value,50,March 2017,"Was very surprised at how good this place was for such a bargain price. Fabulous pool, we barely left it. Great food and big menu selection, entertainment in the evening and very helpful staff. Highly recommend it",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1281,A nice hotel for my family,40,March 2017,"A very well hotel indeed. My son & daughter are really love the pool, it is so big & feel warm, they can spend almost the whole day in that pool. For the deluxe pool view room with twins bed that we've slept, it fits the four of us enough (me,my hubby, my 8 yo son, & my soon 2 yo daughter) & it feels comfy. The room also provide a sofa bed & the pool from our balcony looks great. We've spend two night in the hotel & the breakfast nothing much different. The food tasted fine and have lots of variety to choose. But too bad on our last day the fried rice not cooked well enough. The receptionist, the bell boy, the waitress, the pool man and all the workers there are so nice & polite.I think they've been trained well and working great. Thank you ramada encore my holiday feels great!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1282,Great place to stay out of the Hustle & Bustle,50,March 2017,"We loved everything about Ramada Encore Hotel. The staff were exceptional a big thank you to Wyan, Tita, Novik, Eka, Era, Gitar, Dewi, Aleandro & Aris for being so kind & helpful to us all. The facilities were excellent. Pool. Restaurant, Food, Drinks & Rooms fantastic. We had 2 interconnecting Pool side Rooms & they were well worth the extra money. We could not have asked for a better place to stay, it was a 5 minute taxi ride from the main drag but great because it was nice,quite & relaxing. Nightly entertainment was great too. 10/10 Ramada Encore. We'll be back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1283,Bad service and Discrimination,10,March 2017,"Arrived at this Hotel with my cheap bike. And security asked me impolitely without greetings "" Where you want to go?"" After I told him I wanna check in, he just pointing lobby and said ""Lobby is there"",' Luckily the reception staff, Novik, smile and politely handled me. The room is oke just the linen that they use is looks dirty. However since I just stayed for a night, it was oke for me. The WiFi is bad and soo slow. When I was in the pool I went to they restaurant and the service was so slow and no smile. I ordered food and they just gave it to me like that without saying "" Enjoy your meal"". On that day they had cocktail promotion. They came to a table where there were foreigner couple sitting. They promoted drinks to them in nice smile and politely. However when they came to me, no smile and not even polite. I was thinking probably because I am Indonesian. Night time I planned to have dinner at their restairant however since no one greet, welcoming me, I cancelled my plan. Moreover after I saw how they attractive in interacted foreigner to join with them for dinner. When I checkes out, I went to bar to redeem my welcoming voucher I wish this time I will get smile and better treat, but again I have to feel disappointed. It was my first time staying in hotel where staff's smile was so "" Expensive"" even their salary comes from what i spend there even for a night. I read a lot bad review regarding staff hospitality. I would be fine if the facilities I got below of what I expected however if I got service below what I expected I preferred to share it online rather than inform their manager.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1285,Only as a crash spot. Avoid if possible. Poor service. Poor standards,10,February 2017,"First of all, the hotel is not in Seminyak as advertised. Both drivers have said the same thing.
The room was covered in dust and cobwebs everywhere, and stained bedding. Hair on toilet seat. Having arrived in late in the day, and needing to rest, I told front desk the issues and ask them to clean it all up next day. Nothing was done. Shower rail was broken.
My room was across the corridor from the chamber maids utility room and you can hear all the conversations and laughter from 7am in the morning everyday. Not to mention all the trolley luggage going down the corridor from the hoards of Asian tour groups. Not sure why the door is not sound proof. And when you finally had enough, and leave my room, there're couple of chamber maid trolleys outside my room door blocking the way.
Considering this is low season, service at breakfast was incredibly slow. No cutlery on the table despite asking twice and waiting for ages. A staff was laying cutleries in empty areas whilst most of the folks like me near the busiest area near the pool was left without. In the end, had decided to go and collect cutleries myself.
Pool safety seemed to be forgotten. Having seen two incidents continuously with guests throwing floats and things from their rooms into the pool, the pool side staff just watched it happened with no reaction or action to stop this. Then came a 2m x 1m giant float being thrown from a third floor room onto the pool itself! I'm not sure if I would like to be in the pool.
Last but not least, the hotel had a deal with the taxi office just outside its entrance. My driver was being stopped and lotsa questions asked. Not sure what that impression leaves any guests.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1286,This year we are coming again!,50,April 2016,"During our hole stay everything was amazing! The rooms are superb and I loved my mornings on the balcony! The pool is just fantastik! The breakfast was amazing as well and the people there are so kind and sweet and they always smile! This hotel has became as criterion for me and when I compare it others there is always something missing. And the prices are very good for what you receive! We have already booked our room for this year in april! Im so excited and can't wait! Bali, we are coming!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1287,"Basic, a bit below standard for Seminyak.",30,March 2017,"We chose this hotel for two reasons-there was a good special $183 for two nights, per room, for the time we stayed there (March 2017). The hotel is a bit tired, the decor could do with an update in the foyer and restaurant area. It was a quiet time to be there, but we were placed in a room with the view of a concrete roof. The beds were comfortable and the room seemed clean but my linen was stained and in the bathroom the towels were old and a bit threadbare. The silicon around the glass shower screen was peeling away and unsightly. The standard of the food was quite average, I ordered a soto ayam (a broth filled with noodles and chicken) and my friend a mie goreng- we figured those would be simple dishes that should have been better options than the pastas, pizzas or burgers on offer but we were disappointed, our dishes arrived looking much like the hotel- tired, dull and lacking effort. The positives were the ever smiling and obliging staff, and the lady at reception who handled our enquiries with confident ease. They have free shuttles that take you to nearby Seminyak Square or Kuta starting at 10 am but not frequent. You can organise transport with the hotel drivers or have them call a bluebird taxi. We had no issues with this (we used both options at different times) unlike some other reviewers. The wifi signal was good from our room the second floor and in the foyer when we used it. would personally not return but if you are not planning on spending too much time at the hotel itself then it's fine. Note: if you are travelling in the off season, ask for a room with a pool view as the rest of the views are a but ugly, however if you go for a ground floor pool room, just be wary that there may be significant noise from nighttime swimmers (the pool area seems to be open very late).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1288,Not good for budget traveller!,20,February 2017,"Give only 2 stars due to its location! Tho it's located in Seminyak but it's far from the crowd! You have to go inside a resident area, surprise surprise, not even a walk distance to the center of seminyak crowded road! Also, this hotel is located in the restricted area where you cant order online taxi. You have to always use normal taxi you can order from the hotel which is sort of expensive. I rent a bike for a day, ordered from the hotel. The rental was dishonest! Saying there wasn't enough change for my money and promised to give my money back to the receptionist. Later on they texted me that they had given the change but it still wasnt enough. Payed IDR 100,000 and i should have got back IDR 30,000. But they only gave me 20,000. It wasnt abt the money but i was quite sure they did it deliberately. It would be better if they said it cost IDR 80,000 at the first time. I said i wont give the key back if my change wasnt full, then they gave me another IDR 10,000. Be careful and I think that wasnt the first time they did it! If you have to, just give the exact amount. But i wont recommend as the bike i got was really old bike and got problem to turn on the engine when i used it. I would've got better quality bike if i rent somewhere else! I was pissed the fact that this nice hotel made an agreement with this rental! It was my last day at the hotel and i was so happy i could go away from this place!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1289,"Loved the pool, room & sweet restaurant crew",40,June 2016,"The location is off center & quiet, felt very safe and relaxed in this friendly resort. Staff were helpful, cheerful but not overfriendly.

Rooms were good quality, very clean. Most rooms had a spacious balcony with sofa; overlooking the landscaped pool.

Many comfy sunloungers at restaurant end of pool, so a good swim followed by brunch or snack was effortless. Restaurant staff were all very well trained, fast & attentive. Breakfast area is spacious, food is tasty & varied. Ala carte menu was average quality, better food choices in Seminyak centre.

Shuttle service to Kuta & Seminyak centre
made daily outings easy. In house spa is a simple set up.

Tip: When in Seminyak center, do take advantage of the shuttle service to Ubud, its inexpensive & runs all day.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1290,Poorly managed hotel,10,February 2017,"Hotel itself is nice enough but very poorly managed. Some of the points from our stay - many of which have already been mentioned in previous reviews but have obviously had no action taken against them:

Stained bedding
Poor drainage in the bathroom
Aggressive taxi desk - who massively overcharge and drop you in random places no where near where you asked to go.
Poor Wifi service

In addition during our visit the management decided to host a 17th Birthday party on the Saturday night, which as well as being very loud meant we could not use the bar or restaurant area. Then on the Saturday morning they had some kind of church service which again was really loud and pretty annoying when you are trying to relax around the pool.

The location is also pretty poor and you need to take a taxi - as per previous reviews the hotel won't allow ubers near the hotel and the taxi desk make threats if you try to order one - therefore you are forced to use the hotel cars.

I have no doubt the management will respond to this with ""firstly thanks for staying, we note your feedback and will take action"" and then will do nothing about it as they have clearly not actioned previous feedback on things such as stained bedding and the taxi desk.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1291,I'm not coming back,20,March 2017,"The room is not clean. I accidentally kicked my sandal under the bed when I tried to get it back, I found that it's incredibly filthy down there.
The building looks like it was rushed to finish. There's missing paints or uneven walls here and there.
The food is not recommended. I had the duck for my dinner it felt like the duck was fighting back.
The breakfast also not recommended.
Plus the location is remote from anything. No beach, shops, restaurants or temples",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1292,Nice hotel with good staff,40,February 2017,"Nice property with helping staff.
Swimming pool is neat and clean.
Rooms are good and view is super from deluxe room.
They serve you very nice breakfast with many varieties. The quality of bfast is good.....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1293,Wonderful!,50,February 2017,"We had a great stay here. For $50 AUD a night, it was fantastic. They also upgraded our room which was fantastic! Comfy beds too.

Only downfall was the wifi, we didn't get good reception in our room (towards the back), only when we were in the lobby/pool area.

But that is nothing, this hotel is fantastic. Superb service and food. We will be back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1294,Never stay here again,20,February 2017,"No hot water for 3 days, then had to argue to change rooms. Hotel entrance was flooded for the first 2 days no taxis would come to the hotel so had no choice to use there transport. 45min to Seminyak centre",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1295,"Central, unreliable taxi service",30,December 2016,"This hotel looks very nice when you walk in. Just to ensure, this is a hotel and not a villa of any sort, it has a shared pool in the middle, with pool access rooms on the first floor. The showers had hot water, but the entire bathroom floods overtime you take a shower, as there is drainage system is not fast enough. The wifi signal is also not strong enough, which was disappointing. Breakfast buffet was good.

They do not allow Uber and Grab into the hotel, so if you're using these you'll have to go out to get into the car. Also, if you get the hotel transport, the driver tends to overcharge my a lot. And he also gives confusing instructions, says its not possible to drive through to the venue when it actually was possible.

Would recommend staying here only for a few days.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1296,Do NOT stay here!!! Its so dangerous!,10,February 2017,"We had a nice stay at the Ramada until we had to leave. We just ordered a taxi from the end of the road as the hotel charges 3 times as much. We were followed from the hotel by the taxi staff from the hotel to our taxi by about 10 men on motorbikes, they told us they would follow us and make sure we couldn't get any transport then they threatened the taxi man and he sped off down the road. A few of the men chased him and I dread to think what happened to him...

The rest of them stood across the road from us until we ordered a blue bird taxi. So we were forced to used their over priced service.

I'm very shaken up, I feel sick with worry and I was so scared for our safety.

Do NOT stay here. It is so dangerous!!

I hope to hear from the hotel management soon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1297,Awesome place to stay,50,February 2017,"My partner and I stayed here from 17/2 till 22/2 and wasn't disappointed in any way. We ate and drank at the restaurant and bar and everything was well above standard. Food was delicious and never got a bad meal. Breakfast daily had plenty of variety every day. The staff at the hotel are all so friendly, so much like family that I felt at home during my stay. Thanks to Reynold for the great drinks and chats at the bar. Era was amazing and so funny and always catered to our needs with excellent and professional service. Gita, Natali, Sri also provided a professional and friendly service. Pool was great and well maintained and a good temperature along with gardens and surrounds by Ali. Entertainment at the hotel meant we never had to leave the hotel, but when wanted to do shopping or tours the hotel arranged transport and all for a reasonable price. Air conditioning worked well. Well priced for and excellent hotel and excellent stay. Will be coming back for sure.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1298,Pleasant stay,30,October 2016,"Stayed in October 2016 with family. Stay was pleasant. Rooms were okay, and compact.
The swimming pool is located in the center of the hotel, and is quite nice.
Not the best location but the hotel provides shuttle as per schedule to the busier part of Seminyak. For the return if you don't want to get tied to the shuttle timings... It's easy to get a cab ride back.
Overall value for money stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1299,Pleasant stay. Friendly staff. Clean and comfortable,40,February 2017,"Our first trip to Bali and we picked Ramada Encore Seminyak due to its location and decent reviews via word of mouth. We were not disappointed. Upon check-in, our room was upgraded to the double deluxe with a complimentary delectable chocolate cake and refreshing welcome drinks. Every single personnel from the guest receiver,receptionist till the waiters had a pleasant smile everytime. The double deluxe room was large with clean sheets,hot and cold shower and all the necessary accessories including a high speed and stable Wifi connection. Breakfast at the cafe boasts a decent variety of local and western dishes good enough to give you a boost for a good start in Bali. Car/Mbike rentals are available at the front desk including free shuttle to nearby attractions. Overall it was a comfortable stay and glad we picked Ramada Encore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1300,Alright. You get what you pay for.,30,February 2017,"Well, you get what you pay for at this hotel. It's not a bad place if you spend most of your day out and about and just need a bed and breakfast, or if you are a family on a budget. Otherwise you're better off forking out more $$$ for a more upmarket resort closer to all the action or even going all out a getting a villa.

Having studied previous reviews we knew what we were in for. Service was polite but slow, especially in the restaurant when you often had to physically stop a waiter to get their attention. Room was small but okay. Breakfast not bad. Pool is nice but smaller than the marketing photos - the kids love it. Bar does the job after a day on the road.

The hotel is a little bit out of the way but the free one-way shuttle buses were pretty good, or if you missed the bus, about IDR$25000 one way for a Bluebird cab to Seminyak Square - make sure you ask the concierge for a Bluebird cab. The hotel ""cabs"" are a total rip-off.

The biggest issue was the sheets and towels. Many previous reviews had flagged this. Within 5min of entering our room i was on the phone making a formal complaint. Although the sheets were clean, they were heavily stained, as were the towels. However the worst part was the hair. There was hair everywhere. I swear some of them were pubes. Seriously DISGUSTING. Either the hotel needs to change its launderer or the housekeeping staff are having a puerile laugh at guests expense - if this is the case they should be sacked. We watched the housekeeping staff change all the sheets and towels and inspected everything to make sure we were happy before we let them go.

Otherwise no major complaints. You get what you pay for at this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1301,Loved it!,50,December 2016,I loved this hotel. Not in the centre of Seminyak so a bit quiet and it was so nice. Loved my room and bed. The pool is quite big and very nice. Good options for breakfast and I also had lunch there once. Delicious food! I highly recommend this hotel :D,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1302,Great hotel,50,February 2017,"If you want beach and shopping this is not the hotel for you, however, if you want spotlessly clean rooms, a quiet location, a great breakfast, a fantastic pool, delicious and reasonably priced restaurant food, excellent customer service provided by delightful staff, all at a great price, then this is the place to stay. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and highly recommend it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1303,Lucky escape,10,February 2017,"We very nearly booked to stay here, luckily we plumped for a villa very nearby.
We did decide to come here for dinner though, it was a big mistake.
The restaurant suffers due to TV screens ( no- one watching them), a cacophony of noise masquerading as music ( so loud you can't hear your own conversation). Add to that, so many people smoking( this is 2017, when will this place catch up?)
The service was poor, difficult to get staff to understand that I want a glass for my beer.
Oh, and then the all important part,, the food. In a word, awful. We shared some satay, they were ok. I had Nasi Goreng, it was putrid, fried egg nearly raw, the chicken element was a tiny ovecooked tasteless leg. The rice was really stodgy, could not eat any of it. Wife had spaghetti Bol, ditto.
So pleased that we didn't stay here",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1304,False advertising,20,November 2016,"Specifically chose the hotel for its low price against star rating and also for the gym. The gym was not even a quarter of the size of the one pictured on their website. Once i questioned the staff about it they said that the previous gym had been turned into a meeting room for presentations. The renovation was done months prior, please update your site.
There were constantly ants in the room (i did not have food in there), other guests had mentioned this as well. Bath mats and face towel were not provided. Hand towels and body towels were. Bathroom products aka shampoo, soap, sewing kit etc; were not related daily. I did not use use everything up each day, but when it was empty it took a while to return. On two occasions toilet paper had not been replaced.The room conditions the way they were, i would not have considered it to be four star hotel. (guess the pricing reflected the quality despite ratings) The building has not been maintained very well and it is not that old. Pool chairs were broken and even if the staff was notified the chairs remained for the next unsuspecting guest.
The nasi goreng was probably the worst i had ever had in Indonesia, and i have visited bali numerous times.
The majority of the staff were very helpful and kind, however slow, especially the room service.
I did enjoy my stay minus a few issues however I wouldn't stay here again.
Recommend choosing a quiet room. The pool noise and music is very disturbing when trying to sleep.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1305,Amazing,50,January 2017,"My stay at Ramada was great!
The staff were amazing, and Reynold behind the bar is just gorgeous!
Location is about a 10 min walk to all the shops and stuff but we didn't mind as it was to good to see different things on the way.
The pool is beautiful.
They deliver popcorn to your room upon request - what else could you want!
I would highly recommend.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1306,"Fancy, but isolated",30,February 2017,"I thought this hotel was really nice. The rooms were spacious and clean and the dining area was kinda open air and attached to the pool area. Unfortunately, my husband and I did very little research before we traveled so we arrived in the rainy season which would have been okay had we been in a central location, but the hotel was in the middle of nowhere.
They do have a shuttle to both Kuta and Seminyak, but the kuta shuttle only goes at 10am and 5pm and if it's full you're out of luck. The Seminyak one goes more often, but again it's a small bus that fills up quickly. Perhaps in the non-rainy season they have more buses.
In any case, if you rent a bike or a car and drive around this place is worth it. If you are cheap or hate the idea of driving on the left, I'd say find a more central location.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1307,Nice Hotel,50,February 2017,"The hotel is very nice. All staffs very friendly especialy for Wayan (Receptionist on duty). Wayan is very helpfull and good communication during prepare our room. We did not wait too long to get our room.

1309,100% recommend,50,February 2017,Stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and loved it so much. The customer service was amazing and the food and drink was phenomenal !! The hotel is tucked away from busy streets so it's very quiet as well. Cleanliness of hotel rooms could be better but I 100% recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Seminyak :),Primera Hotel Seminyak
1310,Great service and excellent value for money,40,January 2017,"We stayed in the hotel for 3 days in 3 bedroom one. Good feeling all together, with nice and friendly staffs, good swimming pool etc. We really liked their breakfast, it was the best part of the stay, would recommend to add to your stay. Breakfast starts really early around 7 or 8 am, runs until 11 am. So there is no rush or crowded. Only minus I found was the hotel looks bit old, same with bath room tiles and accessories. But they are really clean and serviced daily.
Ups:
- Breakfast is excellent.
- Good feel.
- Nice staffs - happy help at any time and do things very quickly.
- Brought Birthday cake and candle to our room for my daughter on her birthday.

Can be improved:
- Bath rooms and accessories.
- Chlorine in swimming pool",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1311,Ramada you disappointed !!,20,February 2017,"I wish I could give them more than 2 rating but when it comes to cleanliness, I take it seriously ! And yes my standards are a bit higher than normal -

The bathroom specifically was one of the dirtiest I had seen lately as I've traveled around the world - I understand the rooms are outdated but they could still do a better job cleaning the toilets and shower . Stains all over - I didn't want to post any pictures to gross anyone out ! Also the bed sheets were not very clean either - lots of different dirty spots on them .

Maybe a note to management : it's almost impossible to have a shower without making the floor wet ! The glass wall could have been just a couple of inches wider to avoid that .

The common areas such as the pool , spa and the restaurant were kept fairly well and clean.

The breakfast was alright - good selection .

The location is also not bad specially that they offer free daily shuttles to Kuta and Seminyak square .

The staff were friendly and you could tell they were trying to be helpful . Except that since we had to check out very early they offered breakfast boxes but they completely forgot about it at the end and we just couldn't be bothered to wait any longer there .

So overall , we won't be staying there again - and if I were you , I'd look at other places with better cleanliness rating .",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Simply, Ramada Encore is great value for money from an accomodation perspective. We managed to get a great deal with a Pool Access Room at the same price as a standard room which was definitely much better. The pool was a mere 10 steps away from our terrace door with many day beds and a fabulous lagoon style pool. Despite it raining for the last 2-3 days, we still managed to make good use of the pool during our stay.

The onsite bar and restaurant has a good selection of drinks and food. Food is of good standard, and the buffet breakfast has many options to choose from, and not the same things every day which meant some variety. Drinks and food are priced a bit higher than places on Seminyak or Kuta but it's a resort so it's expected! Only drawback is the pool closes at 9pm, would be great to have this open a bit later for those humid evenings!

The only drawbacks were, the wifi was extremely temperamental. Some times fine, not overly fast though, other times would be waiting ages for internet to work. Maybe it was just internet traffic. Only other thing was there was no hot water on our last morning, so unfortunately has a mildly warm shower before a long day waiting for our flight!

The resort itself is located away from the main area of Seminyak, about a 10 min trip away by hotel driver for $5AUD, $10AUD to Kuta. Onsite spa is convenient though pricey compared to the salons in Kuta or Seminyak.

It's a well maintained property with extremely friendly staff. Shout out to Ray behind the bar who was great!

Overall, a pleasant and extremely affordable stay. Whilst I doubt I would return, it's not because anything major, but would like to try a villa experience next time I visit Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1314,First time in Bali experience,30,January 2017,"We arrived at Ramada Encore at 7 pm very tired because our flight were delayed from Perth and found out from the receptionist that our room wasn't ready yet so we went to restaurant for dinner first. They were very lucky because the food was yummy and the staff's were very friendly.
The worst bar fridge in the hotel though and not cold at all otherwise was ok",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1315,Amazing Pool,50,October 2016,"I would gladly come back to this hotel just for the pool and the breakfast. It was that good. The staff went out of their way to help me and the rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable.
The views from your room (if you don't have a pool view room) are not the best but who cares? The pool is amazing and the location is good. The hotel also will offer a driver service if they cannot call you a taxi and also has a big car park if you hire a car.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1316,Nice Hotel,40,January 2017,Nice Hotel and good staff. Economical as well. Breakfast is ok. Special thanks to Tita for local support. Rooms are decent. best one is room with pool access. Property is not near to a good beach. if you want to relax in hotel then it is good else Seminyak is not that happening place.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1317,Vacation was lit!,50,December 2016,"My friends and I enjoyed our time here. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Very informative, assisted us with transport, made reservations to other restaurants. Food was GREAT! Hernanto, our room attendant was very pleasant and helpful.
What really makes the hotel great us not the aesthetics only but the staff. Very professional and great service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1318,Relaxing Atmosphere,50,January 2017,"This is the second time I stay at Ramada Encore. A bit far from the beach and other attractions, but have a relaxing atmosphere. Always love the hotel. The room is spacious, balcony is big. Friendly staff, great services. Food is delicious and varied. Amazing lagoon pool. Large parking lot. Satisfying and Recommended!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1319,"Great hotel, decent location",40,January 2017,"Had a pleasant stay at Ramada, the staff were fantastic and went above and beyond. The rooms were also spacious and accomodating. The hotel itself is a bit of a track from Seminyak, but they had a free shuttle bus and taxis are cheap. Only negative was that we booked a day tour with the hotel to Mt Batur and the driver knew nothing regarding any sites that we could see on the way/things to do apart from trying to take us to his mates businesses. He was also very pushy abt using his recommended guide who was charging us twice the going rate to hike Mt Batur...needless to say that put me off him.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1320,Lots of things to like about this Hotel,40,January 2017,"Many positives - friendly and helpful staff, spacious air conditioned bedroom, very good selection for breakfast, special mention room service. Didn't mention anything but it was my birthday and the surprise birthday cake and sincere happy birthday wishes is testament to the service. The swimming pool is huge and I really enjoyed the sun lounges in the water. The Hotel also provides a complimentary shuttle service to Seminyak Village and Kuta. Only suggested improvement was the inability of the shower water to drain efficiently which meant some water went into the bathroom area.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1321,staff,40,January 2017,"The statf are all very respectable, friendly and courteous, also very helpful could not fault the staff at all. Upon checking into our room and after a day there was a mouldy smell and under the bed was not clean.. My husband had dropped something and it went under the bed and after trying to get it out, other stuff came out too like a ladies panty-liner??
I spoke to reception and she was going to speak to management after their meeting, as we went for the day.. When we arrived back the afternoon shift were on and I spoke to them and they knew about it and we were transferred straight away into a poolview delux room.. I was quiet happy with the smooth transition and the only other thing I was not happy with and found in both rooms were the bath towels.. They were a grey colour and quite hard to wipe with..
,",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1322,Value for money,50,January 2017,"If you dont have to stay close to the city. The hitel is Great offer... Nice breakfast, clean and spacious room, friendly and nice staff. Good swimming pool. But the location is a bit hard to find. But overall, i would love to stay there if i visit bali",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1323,great centralised local,40,January 2017,Great central place to stay between Kuta and Semiyak. Relaxing lagoon pool and cheap drinks. some visits from the local widelife in our rooms but with the humidity of Bali it was any surprise. Would have liked airconditioning/fans in the dining area but kudos to the staff for still offering smiles in black uniforms in that heat.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1324,Amazing experience,50,January 2017,I just stayed with my adult children for 8 days and it was an amazing experience all round at the Ramada. The facilities were stunning. the pool.. the staff just so friendly. An ideal resort for couples or family. Very relaxed atmosphere.. Close to everything but tucked away from the noise of busy Bali nightlife. Definately will retun again..Thank you wonderful staff at Ramada.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1325,First Bali holiday,40,January 2017,"This was my first visit to Bali and we went in a large family group ranging from teens to oldies
Chose the hotel due to the pool and the quieter area and was very satisfied
The hotel was clean and well kept, the staff couldn't be more helpful especially Era in the restaurant and Ray behind the bar
The only negative thing I could say is the non - pool view rooms did not have any balcony and nowhere to hang washing to dry
Would definitely recommend though",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1326,Overrated and disorganized,30,January 2017,"Firstly the staff are fabulous and try their very best to help and look after you, we went for 9 days. Now all the negatives, the location too far from shops you have to catch a taxi there and back, there is a shuttlebus which is often booked out. Do not book a superior/deluxe room, not much better than a backpackers. Cramped, grubby, no views, when we arrived it stunk of urine, I rang and complained and asked for another room, there wasn't one available till the morning. In the morning I was told I could upgrade to a poolside room if I paid $300 more. I wasn't happy but didn't want to stay in the other room. I must say, poolside rooms are fabulous, large, clean, newish and only 10 metres to waters edge. Beautiful pool.
Next negative usually when you check in, most hotels ask for a credit card imprint, Ramada don't, they tell you to either pay for everything in cash or deposit money into your account. A couple of days later I went to spa for massage, they said no, I was $6.00 short in my account, I had to go and add more money before I could have my massage. Nex - my husband and I received a letter telling us we would be charged $3.50 because there was a dirty mark on one of our towels?? In 40 years of travel I have never heard of a hotel doing this -have they not heard of bleach.
Finally one morning after breakfast we went back to our room to find a letter informing us that the pool would be closed all day and part of the next day for maintenance. Why didn't we get more notice and why couldn't they just close the pool a bit earlier and clean it? Needless to say we will never go back!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1327,One day not enough,50,January 2017,"+ big and spacious room
+ clean bathroom
+ jumbo hollywood bed, probably 240cm wide
+ more pillows and shams
+pool access
+ big pool, kids pool, fountain
+ good price for room and restaurant
+ good food as well
+ half price for second pizza
+ yummy breakfast
+ parking lot
+ minimarket and stores nearby

- far from the beach, not sure if they provide free shuttle

>sad to go but we booked already somewhere else with a higher price but this hotel wayy better.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1328,Thankyou Rey and Dee,50,October 2016,"My husband and I we stayed at this Hotel Ramada Encore with our friends we had a lovely experience all the staff where all friendly and assist us with anything on request!
It was our first time in Bali we didn't know what expect but the experience was lovely we had a some great times we meet lovely people Dee the manager at the time she absolutely lovely she made us feel so welcome!
Rey the bar tender who made us awesome drinks/cocktails he spoke very well English he was very friendly and made everyone feel welcome he even also entertained us with his amazing voice singing to us! What a great voice!
We had an amazing time we looking coming back to experience more beautiful parts of Bali until next time Thankyou!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1329,Beautiful staff!,40,January 2017,"Staff were amazing and so helpful! The pool was fantastic and really pretty at night.
We had a great time, the Saturday night entertainment was also really good :)

The hotels food is also really yummy, it was a lovely place to stay and I'd recommend it to anyone :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1330,At its best,40,November 2016,"Stayed in this wonderful hotel, with my 2 sons 24 and 27yrs old, 1st time for them and could not believe how the staff treated them, with kindness and smiles,
Pool staff, Bar Staff, and all the waitresses were so friendly, and happy, I can't say enough except am going back to see the beautiful staff, thank you, Carmel",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1331,Kids love it..great service...,50,October 2016,"We stayed at the ground level that is connecting with the pool. My boys love it because they can jumped to the pool from our room. The pool is very big and comes with whirlpool. There is a pool bar in the pool. We ate dinner in the hotel, but a bit disappointing with the slow service. I got my food around 45 mins after ordered although it was not too crowded. The hotel is located at the end of the road. You need to have a transport to go out to the town area.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1332,Attractive resort,40,January 2017,"Attractive resort, sort of inbetween seminyak and kuta. Went with a group of young friends but probably is more tailored towards families. Room was nice although double bed was two singles joined together with a topsheet, and at times water and towels were forgotten to be replaced. Good buffet breakfast and cool swimming pool. Next time would probably stay slightly more central to seminyak, but good if you a looking for a quieter spot in Bali. Great spa facilities at a good price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1333,Excellent service and great value for money,50,December 2016,"Best thing about this resort was the amazing service and friendly staff. The hotel was clean, and included all amenities (pool, kids pool, gym and spa) for a very affordable price. They also provide free late checkout at 6pm if you stay for a certain number of nights. Would definitely recommend!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1334,Good quality 4 star hotel,50,January 2017,Enjoyed our stay over new year. We had a room with direct pool access right at the far end of the pool - I would recommend rooms 316 317 318 319 and 320 - these we thought were the best .. food was good in the restaurant .. service was great from all staff we encountered .. loved that we could have sun beds in front of our room in the pool! About a 10-15 minute walk into town which we enjoyed - taxi around $5-$10 and the hotel also have a free shuttle to Seminyak and Kuta throughout the day. We were comfy and would stay again,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1335,Value for money,50,January 2017,"I booked this hotel last minute through booking.com. I stayed in a pool view room. I had a king. Very nice rooms with balcony and lounge. There is a fridge but they call it a cooler (very strange) it is not cold. The room has a safe. Breakfast was included and wide range and mix of foods. Very reasonable restaurant to eat for lunch and dinner. Great extras in bathroom, shaver, toohbrush, shower cap etc. two free bottles of water a day. Pool is maintained very well. Staff very friendly. Lifts quite. 5 min drive into the Centre of Seminyak. Should cost with bluebird cabs about $3 Indonesia. Make them put the meter in.

Very happy with the hotel. Great value.

Will return.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1336,Friendly staff almost make up for dirty bedding & cockroaches,30,January 2017,"The staff are friendly and helpful to the best of their ability. The pool is large enough for kids to be at one end and barely noticeable. The location is further out but nice and quiet although hard to find a taxi to take you back without attempting to rip you off. On the fourth night we received a letter under our door saying we were going to be charged for staining the sheets. I had complained to the staff prior that the sheet and quilt cover had some small stains upon arrival. After speaking with reception and calling housekeeping twice we eventually had our bedding changed and replaced with a sheet covered in an even larger yellow/brown stain. Then there's the overpriced hotel food (stick to the mi goreng or beef rendang). Buffet breakfast was average although they did have waffles every second day. The 'bar fridge' in the room, was infact not a fridge but a cooler (set to 23). So you're stuck with room temp water and soft drink or pay extra for cold water bottles from the hotel bar. Lastly on our final night in ""paradise"" a lonely dead cockroach surfaced near our bathroom..",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1337,Our family Christmas Vacation,50,December 2016,"A very family friendly hotel, their pool was stunning well maintained and beautiful the kids just loved it and never wanted to leave it. The room and hotel staff was outstanding, we enjoyed the free breakfast buffet and also took advantaged of their spa. The Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak made our Bali vacation so much more enjoyable and we are already making plans to come back again",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1338,Highly recommended and Very affordable!,50,December 2016,"My friend and I just visited Bali for the first time and stayed at the Ramada Encore for 11 nights. Best decision we made, even though it's classified as a 4 star place I would give it 5 stars ⭐️and would definitely recommend to everyone all ages!

- The customer service at this place was exceptional! No matter what we needed, an additional charger, a different pillow, a sewing kit they would be there within minutes.

- I loved the Spa on site, $15 AUD for 1 hr Balinese massages all day everyday! If you ask for Devi, she's amazing. She was my personal masseuse for the entire time.

- the Breakfast buffet was good too, they always tried to change it up each day and the restaurant food was very cheap and pretty decent

- very close to centre of Seminyak, only a $3 AUD cab ride to Seminyak square and they offered shuttle services too. But I would only request for Blue Birds (metered taxi service) to get me around which costs $0.70 per km, so cheap!

The only thing I would say that wasn't great was the internet in the rooms, but if you went out to the foyer then it worked fine.

Otherwise highly recommended!! Thank you Ramada Encore for your exceptional service 🙏🏼. Will definitely be back again hopefully soon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1339,"Good Hotel, Very Poor Breakfast System",30,December 2016,"Arriving on 23 December 2016 at 3.30pm, 1 room from 4 pool side room still not ready yet. Stayed from 23-26 December 2016. The room are big, the pool side room give us direct access to the pool. Our minibar desk have wet glass mark stain. The curtain is a little bit dirty. The pool was great. The bar was great too with different performance everyday. Too bad that its all greatness has to be down graded because of the breakfast system. 90% hotels I ever stayed has no rope barrier like Ramada Encore has. And usually free for 1 child under 8yrs. We treated not as guest who need our breakfast but treated as intruder that might get breakfast without paying. Counted one by one when the queue are long enough. On the 2nd day I cannot bear it anymore. So I decided to eat instant noodle only on my room and let my 2 daughter having the hotel breakfast.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1340,Great place !!!!,50,December 2016,"We were picked up from the airport .
We booked new apartments .
Room is clean . Beds are comfortable
. Breakfast excellent .
The hotel is out of town , perfect .
we stayed at this hotel for 11 days .
friendly staff",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1341,Misleading ad at the lounge.,30,January 2017,"Hotel is pretty good. Nice and clean. Came to check in at 2pm and they don't have any rooms for us yet.

Waited for rooms while sitting at the lounge by the pool. They are having buy 1 get 1 free promo on their cocktails. We ordered 2 mojito and when I asked for the bill, I was charged for 2 instead of 1! Question them and they do me that it is not part of the deal. We were not informed when I placed the order.

Nothing mention in the board that says selected cocktails only.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1342,Still Love It Here.,50,December 2016,"Still great. Fourth time here. Probably the only thing that I would recommend to Ramada Encore is to put a top sheet on the bed. I like to sleep with little or no air conditioning and a sheet but can't do this with only a doona. A doona means you have to crank up the air conditioning and make it freezing. Some people like it that way, but I am not a fan. Other than that, like previous visits, everything was excellent.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1343,A visit in Bali,40,December 2016,The place or the Ramada Encore is very good to stay with children. Althoaugh it took us sometime to have checked in and waited hours. The pool area is really good an1sd my children enjoyed their stay..The staff were good and friendly too. The food was ok but mtaybe because we are not used to eating nasi but its all good.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1344,Excellent Stay,50,December 2016,Overall excellent. Handy location in quiet area. Though not in centre of Seminyak central area but hidden away around a km away. Rest all good. Breakfast excellent. Rooms are well maintained. Overall hotel is not old anyway. Pool and its surrounding also stunning. Staff is helpful and friendly. Restaurant food quality and cost just right.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1345,Nice Pool But TOO much for the Service during Breakfast,30,December 2016,"Room Cleanliness 7/10, My used cup was not changed to the new one during my stay until i asked for new cup. The Room is quite big.

Service 6/10
The waitress during the breakfast was not so friendly, even they put an open-closed queue line before we can enter for breakfast, even so we need to WAIT until the waitress finished looking for our names until we can get in. Too much and very NOT comfortable for me, NOT like other hotels that i stayed which is very welcome & friendly.

Hotel Location is a bit far.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1346,Pleasant stay,50,December 2016,Tita one of the staff was very friendly and helpful.she also adviced from where not to exchange the money and which taxi to hire for.my kids loved her.room service was good too.nice and clean hotel .will recommend to anyone anytime.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

When i entered my room bit smelly so i call and asked to spray my room. My next surprised was when i open mini refrig to put my melted chocolate i found trash-2 empty plastic bag with alot of water inside!. I think the room not ready yet to sale it to customers!. Why such 4 star hotel can overlook this matter.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1348,Great place to stay with Family and CHEAP,40,September 2016,"Great hotel to stay with young kids, beautiful pool, great breakfast, rooms are just your normal hotel room layout, generally clean, bathroom a little mouldy smelling but I've been told thats every hotel in the tropics. If you want to be in walking distance to main Seminyak shops this is a bit far away as we had to catch taxi into the main area, and traffic was extremely busy most of the time, didnt matter too much as kids loved the taxi rides and just apart of the experience. There is a beautiful Massage spa just 2 minute walk from the hotel called Murano Spa, this place is tranquil and great service, make sure you stay for the ginger tea at the end!!! Oh beds are amazing, so comfortable!!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1349,Secluded and relaxing,50,December 2016,"We have spent seven nights here and have really enjoyed our stay.
Breakfast is plentiful and has a wide selection on offer. Restaurant menu offers a good variety of food options for during the day dining and dinners.
Pool is absolutely stunning and is exceptionally beautiful at night.
Rooms are clean and neat. It doesn't seem to be given a full clean everyday however nonetheless the room is neat and welcoming after your day out.
I would suggest that you book the pool access suites on the ground floor which offers direct access to the pool from your patio.
Staff are very friendly and very helpful. Private cars and taxis are always available and the hotel requests them on your behalf. Pricing of the private cars are pretty much the same as hiring a private car anywhere else in Bali.

Madhavi Spa : totally worth every cent spent. I found pricing to be on par (if not cheaper) than other spas in the area and even in Kuta. The four hand massage is something out of this world!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1350,Great hotel and hospitality,50,December 2016,"Hotel is pretty far from main Kuta Beach or Kuta Market but very good breakfast specially for indians and vegetarian food and nice crew, pool connected room is having the extra edge for hotel, bed and shower are good.
Overall i will recommend this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1351,Nice holiday,40,December 2016,"When i was check in to the room,i was surprise with the room.. thanks to reception who gave me a room like what i requested, i stayed 3 rooms which is the 2 rooms was next door (1135&1136) the rooms was totally kids pool side, my kids love it,the adult pool was amazing big but flat, the room looked clean but please clean under the bed and sofa also,the staff quite friendly but some of them also no greeting, maybe because im balinese.. but anyway it was nice holiday for me and family, maybe i'll come back.. thanks Encore",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1352,Over rated on Trip Advisor,30,December 2016,"We stayed here as part of a deal. Arriving early, we were happy to wait for check in and went to have a drink. We were given a free welcome drink, that neither of us felt able to drink. A syrupy concoction that was diabetes inducing.
We were then told our room was ready and we asked the staff to charge our drinks to our room. Then the waitress chased us, demanding money, as we had not put aside an amount on our credit card to cover the costs. We had offered our credit card at reception and it had been rejected, so the reception staff had ot done their part, but this was not a great way to start.
We took a journey through prison like corridors to get to our room. The room had a balcony, which was inaccessible, as there was no door onto it. The bathroom was tiny and dark and the bedroom small, with limited space for unpacking our clothes. In the end, one of us unpacked and the other lived out of the suitcase.
The staff are friendly and generally accommodating. A ""shuttle bus"" is offered to Seminyak. However, this is a one way trip only, which means that it is not a shuttle. And it is not a bus. A 6 seater taxi was being used instead, whilst the the bus stood in the carpark. So if you were not one of the lucky 6, you did not get a ride. The 11 seater bus is the one on the brochures, but we missed out on the ride inot town, because they were not using the actual bus.
Breakfast was dissapointing and having to be checked at the entrance to the restaurant with the entrance roped off and allowing us in one by one, irritated us. An unusual practice and as I left something behind in our room the forst day and had to go through the whole process again to gain entry, it was very annoying.
The fruit was great at breakfast. Evrything else, was bland and not worth the effort. And our table was cleared every time we got up to get anything else. We gave up on having coffee, as it was cleared away every time, before we actually drank it. The same for my fruit platter, when I went to get the coffee and then the coffee was cleared when I went to replace the fruit. Farcial and annoying. Only one of us was brave enough to put up with it a second time.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1353,Still memorable & enjoyable.,50,December 2016,"Overall, great team doing their best to make our stay really pleasant. Thank you!

I just love the bed. Mattress really comfortable, pillows are to die for!😊

Lovely room by the pool, complete with balcony directly accessing the pool area.

Breakfast always a pleasure to partake.

I guess some things could always be improved, if possible. Such as, new sets of towels perhaps? The existing ones look rather worn, although clean, I know it must be tough to keep white towels looking prestine.

The Spa was pleasant but may benefit from more training. Inconsistent standards or techniques between masseurs.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1354,"Bedsheet, Curtain and Towels are dirty",20,December 2016,"Not so good experience while staying at this hotel for 4 nights. Bedsheet, curtain and towels are dirty so that my wife asked to change our room. Get better one yet the towels are still not clean enough.

Second dissapointment is the kids club are no longer there, the management of the hotel has decided to use the room for meeting room, and move the kids corner at the corner of lobby.

However, i have to say the pool is great and nice for those who have 10 months baby to enjoy the kids pool area.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1355,"Recommended, but mind the location!",40,December 2016,"Ramada hotel is a nice hotel, decent clean rooms. The big bonus here is the pool. Another winner is you get a lot of hotel for your money,so price quality is great.

The thing that might give you second thoughts is the location. Either you get yourself a motorbike and then the problem is solved. Or you ask reception to get you a taxi when you want to explore. Within walking distance is nothing, hardly shops and no beach.

But if you can deal with this you've found yourself a great place to stay!

Pros:
*price quality
*staff
*pool is great
*food is good enough

Cons:
*as explained, the location is something you need to be aware off.

Hope you enjoy your stay as much as I did!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1356,Spacious room and great pool,40,December 2016,"I stayed 2 days, the room is clean. nice swimming pool, I'll come back later. highly recomended. I want to go back to stay there, because the rooms are very comfortable and friendly staff. But internet connection poor",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1357,"Modern hotel, ok location, ok food.",30,December 2016,"The hotel itself is nice, but the room is not very well cleaned.The towels are almost grey, and the clean up is just very very basic, they basically only made up your bed, not even cleaning the hair in the bathroom. The option in the restaurant is very little, menu is not big. You have to walk about 20 minutes to the main road, it's not to bad. The staff at the counter were very friendly and helpful.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1358,"Not happy with the service, irresponsible staff",10,December 2016,I check-in to the Delux room which is supposed to sound-proof but there was some noise coming from a nearby place. I informed the staff 3 times that I am not able to sleep and then the Duty Manager came in and he said that you have to bear this sound till 12:00 am then it would stop. I requested to change my room as I had to catch a flight the next morning but then too they did not provide me a different room. Highly irresponsible staff n poor service. I would not recommend it to anyone.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

1361,Tourists! Tourists!,30,November 2016,"Great value for the price we paid. However this is your typical tourist hotel, a bit noisy, breakfast food without much variety and cleaning not too thorough. Also a bit out of the way but they do have a free shuttle to main shopping areas.

Not exactly a place to chill and relax.

The staff was very friendly and polite. I love Bali because of its culture and its people but if can afford something more luxurious this is not the place to stay in.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1362,Very good value for money,40,November 2016,This hotel is very good value for money. Good choice at the buffet breakfast. Massive pool area and adequate gym for a quick workout. The rooms were very clean and comfortable with nice soft beds. The staff were very friendly and helpful especially Tita. The only downside is the location but then again if this hotel was central i'm sure it would be twice the price so can't have everything!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1363,Mr/Mrs,40,November 2016,"My stay at Ramada Encore is trully a memorable one, most staff are very helpful and offer you options if one is not available. Very reasonably price, location is great away from traffic noise. We also enjoyed the very relaxing treatment at the spa. Special mention of the staff that we had a great time with starting off with Brian at reception very helpful and informative of things we need to know around Bali, Anita at the restaurant who is always there to assist us and give suggestion about the menu, Housekeeping make sure that our room is cleaned when we request it. The driver who took us to the airport on our last night very courteous. The only negative experience that we had is our last night dinner when my wife requested for a cushion on the metal chair and tge waiter said no because it will get wet disappointed thou we just agreed but when a white couple on the other table requested the same they were given one right away, discrimination or double standard? Wouldn't name the waiter he could be in trouble. But overall experience still worthwhile. Be coming back for sure.

1364,Great Value for Money.,40,August 2016,"Good Value for money. Buffet breakfast with lots of options from western to local falvours. Massive pool area Spa services are great and well priced. will stay there again. Pool side rooms are the way to go. offers free shuttle to Seminyak and Kuta
Friendly and helpful staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1365,Not the best,10,November 2016,"Our room was large but unclean mould all over both bathrooms, one toilet continuously blocked had a horrible smell which we found 2 days later was because a bag of garbage had been left under sink. Pool was lovely, view great from room, food very average",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1366,Woderful wxperience,50,November 2016,"Hotel is more thanx expectation ,hotel staff is very good and rooms are comfortable recommended for travelers who are visting bali hotel provides everything ,they have also free shuttle buses so if you want you can travel by them also",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1367,"Friendly, clean and quiet",40,November 2016,"The staff at the hotel were very friendly, and were very helpful when arranging our late night arrival transfer from Denpasar airport which gave us a great start to our holiday. The room could be cleaner, but for the price was reasonable. Pool is excellent, and the food was good too.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1368,Not bad,30,November 2016,"The hotel surrounding is good, so far from public attraction. The room was perfect clean, but too many mosquito in the room. The swimming pool and bar is good. In room dining is perfect, thx for the chef. But the breakfast was too standart no menu variation and the taste just so so.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1369,Great place!,50,November 2016,"Beautiful hotel! We were picked up from the airport and arrived to a nice welcoming from the staff (all who are very nice and friendly) we booked a pool side room which we got one at the back of the hotel. Which we didn't mind as it was quieter. Room was nice, smelt Abit think it just needed to be aired out. Although it was nice small detail to the mould in the bathroom is needed. We love the food there only problem is they wanted you to pay as soon as you finished even if you were staying in all day! Was Abit far from places, we didn't use the free shuttle but opted for a taxi and when your paying $2-5 each time isn't that bad. Over all we loved the place will definitely bring our kinds back. Oh and the pool was amazing!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1370,We are stuck for a month...,10,November 2016,"We come to Bali tnree/four times a year and stay somewhere different each time 5star on the beach, homestay with family and everything in between, we love it, we always stay a month. But, this time we have really stuffed up. This place is just not Bali. Shuttle should read drop off one way bus 16 seats once in the morning once at night to Kuta taxi needed to return, go another time etc. Beach shuttle only goes to the square. Bar for drinks is an absolute ripoff. Pay for everything as you go, by pushing it was rectified but the place is run by really young staff, doing their best but totally out of their depth for a 4star hotel. Having dinner in the restaurant two young girls started stripping the floor with paint scrapers and chemicals, smokers everywhere at breakfast. Makes for quite unpleasant meals. Good ambience otherwise. Tour groups reign oh so noisy, not much the staff can do but the noise hardly makes this very out of the way hotel quiet and idyllic. We have paid for an upgrade but hate to think what any other rooms have, the only difference is a sofa. We are overlooking the wiring under glass to the restaurant and bar area so need to keep room closed it's ugly. You can say you get what you pay for but we have had better rooms with sea views, perhaps no walk up bar to the pool but so much fresher air and money in your pocket for the extras. Know which way I would rather go.....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1371,Very nice hotel with a very friendly crew.,50,November 2016,"We had a nice stay at the Ramada Encore hotel. We were traveling with a 1 year old baby so we needed a hotel with a good swimmingpool and a place were our baby could play a little. The swimming pool had a nice area were the water level was around 15cm with lazy chairs in it so we could lay down with our baby still being able to play in the water.
The breakfast was very nice and there was enough choice in foods.
The crew was very friendly and the visited us regularly to see if we or our baby needed anything.
Every night there was something going on, a singer, fire dancing. And the food was very affordable and nice. The restaurant closed at 23:00 which was very nice because after that time there the whole hotel was silent again, ready for a good night sleep.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1372,Love this place,50,November 2016,"This hotel is such good value for money. It's away from the main part of Seminyak so it's very quiet and peaceful and you can walk into the main areas in 20 mins which I really enjoyed. The food is great, the staff are great and the rooms are very comfortable. This was the second time we stayed here. If you want to be close to the beach don't stay here though. If you want peace and tranquility then this is the place for you. Everyone that works here you are amazing!!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1373,Holidays in Bali,40,November 2016,"The hotel is a nice property with a variety of rooms. We had booked 3 rooms. We opted for an upgrade and the hotel staff gladly put us up in the upper category rooms, of course for a charge. But, we were happy with their services.
The restaurant is located by the pool side and it is good to seat over 100 persons. The breakfast spread was great. All hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We had a nice stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1374,Good holidays,40,November 2016,"A very quaint hotel
Extremely curteous staff
Taxi call facilities to be improved and and should have a tie with Bluebird taxi service !!
Not getting a taxi from this hotel at reasonable rates is the main problem",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1375,Small but Big,50,November 2016,"Staying here for 2 nights. Have no idea where was the exact location as the hotel location wasn't right beside the main road.
It looked as the same 4 stars hotel when we arrived...but wait...I shouldn't stereotype all 4 stars hotel because these hotel is way bigger. Big swimming pool, big restaurant and big comfy room. I fall in love with Ramada Encore :) :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1376,"Great staff, clean rooms",50,November 2016,"Check in was a pleasure, Staff very helpful & friendly. Rooms are super clean and bedding nice and crisp. Beds are comfortable. I would recommend that for the few extra dollars you upgrade to the pool access rooms. Breakfast excellent. Entertainment in the evening really good. Location isn't great, but its quiet. Shuttle goes 4 times a day to Seminyak & 2 a day to Kuta, very handy. Taxi back about $5.00. Spa excellent & good prices. Sapna best smile. Ngurah at the pool real friendly. Great ambience.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1377,Great place,50,November 2016,"This place was really fantastic. Good rooms, good food, good people, great service, fantastic pool, and a great ambience. Recommended to all. Free shuttles to Seminyak square (3.9 kms) and kuta. Easy access and blue bird taxi available on call.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1378,"Affordable Luxury, if your not picky.",40,November 2016,"Only real issue was noise, the walls and floors seem very thin, so up until about midnight, and starting early, you hear chairs etc being moved, mostly by housekeeping, and groups of families. I didnt have a big issue, as i go to bed late, and sleep pretty soundly, but the other 3 in my group (all different Pool access rooms) did have issues.

Id still reccomend, cause it was one of the best Bang for Bucks places, and facilities were awesome, food was fantastic (ask for well done if your at bbq early, as the heat was too slow, but when re-cooked was tasty).

Its not a luxury place. Bare that in mind, BUT if your skimping on a few $ on your holiday, but want to pay that bit extra (it was less than $100p/n AUD for Pool access) then this will give you that taste of luxury without the real cost.

Wifi, for me wasnt too bad i was in 1320. But for 1313+1315+1317 was very bad. It is free however everywhere.

1320 has a little bat who sleeps during the day on the pool sitting area, he is harmless, and never spooks you but is good for pics. He was there 3 out of 4 nights. I liked him.

Communication was an issue, the pool servers for drinks, speak English as a 3rd language, and obviously were told during employment, to just say ""Yes"" to any request or question. This caused drama (resolved with some teeth grinding) on first day, when i asked about Cocktail 2-1 59K from 3pm-10pm The server told me it was all the 59K cocktails and it was NOT. The 2-1 cocktails are also half strength, not really a bargain.

Id still stay there tho, but maybe off peak. Low price time.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1379,Absolutely wonderful,50,November 2016,"Best hotel in Bali by far, to start off with the staff are amazing so helpful and caring. The rooms are so wonderful and clean! The breakfast is good and the food is also wonderful. Definitely worth a visit when coming to Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1380,Great Value Hotel,40,July 2016,"We've stayed here twice now. Both times were of the same quality. Excellent rooms, I would compare them to 4 star Australian rooms. The pool is a little cold as it doesn't get much direct sunlight but that suited us as we have 3 young kids who hate re-applying sun block:). But there are no water slides or kids daily activities/games provided. The buffet breakfast is nice, the evening buffet is lacking a little. This probably isn't a hotel you would stay more a 3 nights at as there's nothing to do in the hotel, i.e. no different restaurants or water slides etc for the kids. But it is a great option if you had plans of going to Ubud on a day trip then spending another day at say Potato Head. In other words, its a fantastic base for a few days but not the type of hotel you would want to spend everyday hanging around the pool. A trip to the main town is $3AUD for the distance wasn't a problem. We had a 3 bedroom suite which lead directly into the pool from our balcony, it was huge, beautiful and very modern. We'd definitely stay for a couple of days again if we were back in Seminyak, great value.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1381,Incredible Value for Money,50,November 2016,"Stayed here with a few friends last in November 2016 and all I can say is it is one of the best value for money hotels around.

No problems with check in, all the staff were polite and efficient. They spoke good English too. Swapped up some GBP into IDR, although exchange rates are better elsewhere.

Room was of good size. Bed was super comfy. It was pretty clean too. Shower was nice and powerful. Air Con worked well.

Lovely pool area. Decent amount of sunbeds, towels were provided, large pool.

Gym was very small, but still managed to go every day.

Spa was very good value for money and good quality too.

Breakfast was very nice, with a large selection of food!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1382,"Second stay, superb value for money.",50,November 2016,"First time we stayed here in August 2016, and we returned three months later on the 12th November.

The hotel is out of town, perfect.
Hidden away from the noise and craziness of Seminyak, Kuta, Legian and so on. Is is a 20minute walk to the Main Street of Seminyak and you have to double that of you want to get to the beach. Taxis are really cheap though if you are willing to put up with the traffic.

Pool is huge in the middle of the venue, nice and quiet. Meals are very well priced, tasty but not huge in size. Compared with other similar venues in Bali a good match.

Upon our arrival on Saturday afternoon we were great d by Brian, he checked us in. The room was smaller then the one we stayed on our precious visit so we have rushed down to the reception to see him again. He looks into it and we upgraded.

This chap is a huge asset to your operation, nothing was too much of a trouble.

Thank you again,
Rob n Katie",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1383,Great value for money,40,November 2016,"Great Value! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Ramada Encore for four nights during our stay in Bali. Whilst the hotel was slightly dated, overall it provided an exceptional experience given the cheap price tag. It had great space to lay next to the pool and relax, as well as a great in-house menu (we loved the pizzas!). Staff were generally nice, but could have been more helpful. There were some unusual stains on some of our bed sheets, but otherwise the rooms were well-kept. The hotel is also some distance from the main attractions in Seminyak, which should be kept in mind when booking this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1384,"Cats, rats & bats",20,November 2016,"We stayed at this hotel for one week. We had a king deluxe and a twin deluxe room. The king deluxe was actually two king single beds pushed together, not comfortable. The bedding, unsurprisingly, did not fit the bed. The rooms smelt musty. The customer service provided by the staff was extremely poor. We were not allowed to charge to our room unless we put a large deposit down and pay any difference on a daily basis.
This hotel has towel cards, no towel card, no towel. If, at the end of your stay, you have misplaced a towel card you will be charged $15 per card, be warned.
This hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere, a good 20 minute walk to anywhere.
During our stay, we decided to have a drink on our ground floor balcony, noticed a cat, scrawny, feral, quickly followed by a large rat. Not nice
Breakfast was accompanied by the local bat population.
We would not stay at this hotel again and not recommend it",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1385,"Relax, out of the hustle & bustle",40,November 2016,"Very pleased with this hotel. Room was nice & clean - we had a pool access room which was handy. Pool is beautiful. It has a kids play area - AWESOME! Wifi was good, food was good. Staff were beautiful, always smiling.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1386,Nice room...,40,November 2016,Suprised for me..when you come late and then we got upgrade room..tks ramada encore...overall the hotel is good ....and better if the hotel will playing traditional music at lobby and thats make us feel like bali home...,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1387,"Quick Visit, Large Pool, Remote Location!",40,June 2016,"We stayed here for 2 nights last June for a quick getaway. We booked a deluxe pool view. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was pretty comfy. Buffet breakfast shouldn't be missed, they have a wide selection of Indonesian local foodies.

This place is away from busy bits, off the big road so therefore its quiet. You can't walk to somewhere nearby, you need to get a cab. For those who love to walk like us better get a room in seminyak down town or kuta where there were lots of shops and real good restaurants around.

We spent most of our time outside as there were lots of nice places to explore. We did enjoy the large pool on our last day.

This place is awesome for those who wants a quiet vibe.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1388,Hotel with unique pool and great breakfast,50,December 2015,"Been here with my husband. We like the room, space enough. We choose the one with pool access. Love the breakfast, many variety. But you have to ask for bacon if you want it. they dont display it. the hotel is not in the busy road, but they have wide parking area. and do have shuttle also. recommended. will goin there this november.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1389,"Good experience, accessible to certain points, value for money",40,November 2016,"We got the poolside view and room was okay. Breakfast buffet was okay with good selection as well. However, staff could still be trained on service -- requested for extra pillow upon check-in and it took 5 follow-ups before it arrived at the room, asked for another item and it never came. Also, as our flight leaving Bali was at 8AM, we needed to check-out of the hotel by 6AM. Since we paid for the breakfast on that day, we requested if we could possibly have some bread takeaway on the way to the airport (since the bread was already at the buffet table and we paid for the breakfast on that day) but they didn't allow us. Some of the staff not smiling though.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1390,Recommended,40,November 2016,"Advantages:

- STAFF: very attentive and friendly staff, available to help 24/7;
- BREAKFAST: very good range of food, good coffee;
- TERRITORY: nice pool and garden, large and well-designed lobby area, wide range of entertainment for children and adults, incl. X-Box and karaoke;
- CONNECTION: wi-fi is quite good and stable, about 3 megabits/sec which is quite good for Bali hotels;
- AMENITIES: shampoo, shower gel, body lotion, dental kits, cotton buds, shower caps;
- FOOD AND DRINKS: good range of dishes can be ordered in the restaurant on reasonable prices, complimentary cocktails and snacks are offered every day in the pool area.

What needs some improvement:

- CLEANNESS: our room was generally fine, however it looks like it is not being cleaned properly and the room definitely needs some re-novation. What is most upsetting is the quality of bed wear and towels: the towels are almost grey, some stains were found in the bed wear.

General impression is quite good, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and can recommend it :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1391,Family friendly,50,October 2016,"The pool was extremely family friendly with many depth, it was my favourite pool that we visited whilst in Bali. There is a children play area which I found very convenient too. The staff were very friendly and looked after us. I will be back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1392,"Good service, Good Price and Nice stuffs",40,November 2016,"It was satisfactory service as I asked for a room on the upper levels with a good view of the pool. But they could only manage me to give it on the first floor where all you can see is the tree.
I really liked the location as it is not on the main roads which which is more relaxing from all the noises on the main streets. The pool is wonderful to spent a lazy afternoon. The stuffs were great and very friendly. Overall satisfied with the service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1393,Absolutely amazing!,50,October 2016,"Right from the moment we were picked up from the airport by Sony who is contracted by the hotel, I could already feel like this was going to be an awesome holiday. When we arrived at the hotel check in was quick and easy and reception brought our bags to our rooms. We booked two pool access rooms (1315 & 1316) which in our opinion and others, were the best room locations in the hotel. Rooms were large and clean. Bathroom was spotless. Towels and sheets smelt really fresh and clean. The beds are massive, and both beds and pillows are beyond comfortable. Every morning was a full buffet breakfast with everything from rice, eggs cooked how you would like, bacon, cakes, waffles, fruits and salads,as well as juices and coffee all of which was absolutely delicious. The pool is immaculate and on one day we spent 9 hours in the pool having cocktails and beer delivered to us by Putu who didn't need us to get out once! The food is well priced and everything I tried I loved, carbonara, pizza, enchiladas, chicken burger. And the fried ice cream and chocolate peanut butter milkshakes are to die for!!! Live singers through out the week were wonderful and we were lucky enough to be there for Halloween! They went all out with being dressed up and full entertainment- live singer, traditional Balinese dances and fire dancers and finished off with a DJ. Not to mention the free cocktail, full buffet dinner and prizes for $15!

The hotel is in a back street as everyone has said, but a blue bird taxi is around $2 to Seminyak/Legian and $4-5 to Kuta. There's a little mini mart just down the road that u can buy smokes/ drinks snacks etc at if you forget whilst in town and they also offer a free shuttle a few times a day into Seminyak and Kuta.

But what made this trip truly special were the staff. We weren't guest in their hotel it was more like friends and family. Everyone from the gardeners and house keeping, to the hostesses and bartenders all knew your name. Stoped and said hello and asked how your day was. Spent hours talking to you whilst sitting at the bar. Learning about each other's life's and differences from different parts of the world,that's what makes this place the best place I've ever stayed.

Hermanto (kadek) from housekeeping made sure our rooms were clean and tidy every day. Always checked in and made sure everything was ok. Came back twice to towel animals made on the bed which were super cool.

Murnie, Gita, Putu and especially Era were the mostly lovely hosts/ waitresses/waiter ever! They all Knew us by name, knew what rooms we were in. Alway, Alway! Stoped for a chat and asked how our days were going and made sure we always had everything we needed.

And Novi and Reynold at the bar were absolutely awesome people! So many laughs and stories. Ray speaks awesome English and makes some awesome cocktails.

All these guy, alone with everyone else I hope get recognised for the awesome jobs they do, they definitely deserve it.

I miss you guys already and can't wait to come back.

I Gusti keep up the awesome work and you should be proud of your team!!!

1394,Nice pool!,30,October 2016,"I was quite surprised when I arrived to the hotel. The location is far to everything therefore you can't walk to somewhere nearby but need a car/taxi. The rooms were nice but housekeeping can do better in terms of readiness of bathrooms .... A very bad thing to experience...

on the other hand, I enjoyed the bar and the pool. Very relaxing area that would keep you happy. Staff is friendly, they interact with the guests and are ready to help/smile to you.

Food was ok, I asked for a Kiwi juice, got busy with my phone then looked at my juice and it was WATER with a layer of Kiwi on top. Asked to change it and got pretty much a similar one, a bit better but too much water. (Picture attached to my review)

All in all, there is room for improvement.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1395,Excellent spa,50,October 2016,Book in advance and enjoy a professional and clean spa. A number of choices on the spa menu and the ladies are all trained and look after you. Prices very reasonable for the quality and professionalism you will receive. Feel pampered in beautiful surrounds too. Recommend a visit to this spa if you want a quality massage and pedicure that isn't beyond repair.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1396,Wouldn't return if someone paid me,20,October 2016,"We checked in to this hotel on day one of our trip to Bali. We had booked the place based on the ramada brand. What was waiting for us was a truly forgettable experience.

To start the hotel is located in a remote corner in a cul de sac. This is extremely difficult to locate using a gps. It's also quite far away from anything notable, so other than dumping stuff, showing and sleeping the hotel isn't of much use.

The rooms were quite small, though the oeuvre was fair. They also showed signs of wear and tear. The overall cleanliness seemed poor and the worst part was not getting clean towels even at the second time of asking. This was a huge let down for us.

The only saving grace for the hotel and the reasons I'm giving it two stars - the extremely friendly staff and the amazing pool with its bar.

The breakfast spread while good on the different types of dishes was extremely repetitive everyday.

All in all I wouldn't go back if someone paid me for it, extremely disappointed with a Ramada brand hotel turning out this poor.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1397,Get a pool access room,50,October 2016,"I stayed here twice in October. First time with a friend second time by myself. It's a fantastic place to stay. The staff are lovely. It's not on the main road so it's nice and quiet. They have a spa upstairs that my friend said was excellent. They seem to book up fairly quickly for the massages so book in advance. Otherwise there's another nice massage place just down the road on the left called Murano. The hotel has a beautiful lagoon pool with tropical trees. I got a pool access room both times I was there and it was fantastic. Back door opens to the pool side. They do nice food and drinks at Ramada. Breakfast was included in my booking and it was a large buffet. They had cereals, fruit pieces with yoghurt, cakes, Indonesian food, toast (few different types) croissants, juices, and someone over on one side to make you eggs whatever way you wanted them. I saw bacon floating around as well. Room service is 24hours. I can verify this as I did put in an order for some food in the middle of the night and they more than happily delivered it to me. The hotel is fairly new and well maintained. Found the bed comfortable and the pillows luxurious. I really enjoyed staying there I would definately stay there again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1398,"Comfy bed and gorgeous pool, but......",30,October 2016,"The bartenders try to rip you off at any chance you get and the locations isn't ideal. We drank our own beer instead of dealing with them. Breakfast was great, comfy bed, and great pool make up for the location. Free shuttle into town was a bonus. Room was filthy and not cleaned well. I would rent a scooter or only do a short stay here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1399,It's ok,30,October 2016,Had 5 nights there and it's a lovely place with some great people work there but can be frustrating sometimes but I mentioned it to two lovely girls and they took it on board but the top man is Dipa that change my sheets gave me water and kept me stocked with shower gel and after thanking him for his great service he made me a towel puppy and have a nice day note I hope,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1400,Amazing hotel with such friendly staff!,50,October 2016,"Stayed here for 4 nights. The accommodation was lovely not a bad word to say.. breakfast was more than what you would expect so much choice of foods, definitely worth adding on breakfast before you come!

All the staff were always smiling - only too happy to help with anything you need. In particular have to mention Dipa who called himself 'room boy' - he cleaned our rooms each day to an outstanding standard and on our last day left us a sculpture made out of towels!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1401,Poor service,20,October 2016,"As frequent travellers to Bali, we've been lucky to have experienced numerous resorts and always a fabulous holiday- until now.
Holidays in Bali are always great but topped off with impeccable service and not wanting for a thing.
Ramada unfortunately fell short of previous outstanding experiences with attention to detail lacking
- 3 guests, had to request 3 towels on a daily basis as only 2 were supplied
- warm fridge and had to pay for ice daily
- not supplying fresh glasses/coffee/tea cups until requested
- rubbish bins not emptied
- general maintenance (toilet seat and shower broken)
To mention the small things
We wouldn't return to this hotel or recommend to family/friends",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1402,Lovely hotel,50,October 2016,The hotel is fabulous. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The pool is ideal with the bar and restaurant just beside it. You can order straight to the poolside. Room is very spacious and the bed is comfortable. All in all very relaxing trip.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1403,Average,20,October 2016,"Myself and my partner stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our holiday. Good food and great service from a lovely friendly young man that took us back to the airport. Reception staff not quite as helpful when making a complaint about our room due to descriptions not being accurate on booking.com. Very defensive and dismissive of my complaint. Our first room not only didn't live up to the description but also smelt like a smokers room and had only a window looking out onto a ledge covered in cigarette butts. I had requested a none smoking room. Eventually after paying to upgrade we were moved to a better room. We were giving a discount on breakfast which was good.Cleaning standards not great bathroom wasn't 'cleaned' throughout our stay. The hotel cleaning staff started cleaning rooms very early around 8am. This is fine for those early birds however they created ALOT of unnecessary noise outside the rooms on every morning of our stay. Transport is needed to get into Seminyak. Free shuttle at set times into the centre however the last one is 5pm which is a little early for younger couples who may wish to have a drink in the bars after dinner. No return shuttle however taxi's can be as cheap as 50,000. Overall unfortunately for us the bad points outweighed the good for this hotel. I'm sure these issues could be rectified for future guests. We however wouldn't return and found we were quite disappointed for a Ramada hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1404,Quick visit,40,October 2016,"I liked this place although it was a bit out of the way and off a very major highway and not a lot of locals knew where it was, two drivers I had got lost and had to stop numerous times to ask directions (at my insistence) to find the place, I remembered the location pretty well after that! It was good value for money, rooms were clean, room service prompt but it irked me that the minibar had absolutely nothing in it not even milk and no freezer so no ice which room service then wanted to charge me a cost when I kept asking for ice. I solved it by going to the bar before heading up to my room and getting a glass full there. Guys behind the bar very friendly, particularly one whose name I didn't get. The front desk were very accommodating however the room they put me in had a shocking view and a balcony that you couldn't get onto. Facing the generator plant for the whole hotel there was a big crack that you could navigate a small vehicle through where the window didn't meet up with the frame. Was otherwise a very quiet room which had a fantastically comfortable bed and pillows, the best nights sleep. Had a party of 5 trying to check into my room at 12:38am one night, not the hotel's fault but guests please look for the same number on the room that's on the key? Pushed the bed over to do yoga, the floors?...ick...but got a free Bali fridge magnet! Bathroom was small but great shower pressure and drainage was very good. No doors on the showers and no shelf or bench room to put things on otherwise really good. Breakfast was just ok, same thing everyday was just a bit bland and I would have liked to have seen more traditional dishes with more flavour. They also had a band on one night and the singer sounded like the hotel cats fighting, sorry but made my ears cringe, then they had them back for the following day...all day!! ouch, ouch. Massage was good and the spa was really nice with a long walkway balcony that access the rooms. Only had reflexology there which was more like a foot massage. Go to Bodyworks they have the best and they are still cheap compared to home. Was easy to walk down from the hotel to Eat Street, probably around 20-30 mins but accessible, flag a taxi from the road if you don't want to pay $5 a ride every time you want to go to Eat Street or Seminyak Square area. Only 150,000rp for hotel to airport so good value there.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1405,Family trip,50,January 2016,"Ramada Encore we highly recommend. The service is exceptional and very friendly.
Great atmosphere and fantastic resort for families with children.
Rooms are spotless and cleaned every day.
Whenever we travel to Bali we always go to Ramada Encore in Seminyak.
We have made many friends.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1406,"Large pool , quiet location, friendly staff, good value",40,October 2016,"If your looking for a good value holiday that is a little off the main area of Seminyak then I can recommend this motel. Free shuttle into Kuta and (Seminyak or 15-20 minute walk), a local taxi to Seminyak cost around $3.00 AUD. A very large lagoon style pool with baby pool. Good variety of food and drinks at very reasonable prices. Free local intertainment with dinner and movie night. We stayed in a pool view room with belcony ( recommend) good air conditioning although we had to reset the fuse box switch once a day ( no big deal). King size single beds joined together very comfortable and large soft pillows. TV reception reasonable. Bathroom a little dated but ok. Very friendly staff across the whole motel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1407,Good value for money paid,40,October 2016,"Very quiet hotel well off the beaten track and definitely away from the maddening crowds. Amenities were standard with a lovely big pool, food was reasonable delicious as we ate there a couple of times. Dipa the room attendant was very helpful and willing and obliging in fulfilling his work duties.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1408,Friendly staff and nice hotel,40,October 2016,"1 week we stayed at the Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak is a very nice holiday. When we enjoyed dinner there, one of the restaurant staff named Suparta very friendly and courteous in providing services to us. He also told me about the little attraction retreat is quite interesting to visit can even make us want to try again. The room is also very nice, neat and complete. No less interesting, the pool there is also very convenient to use for capture the moment of our time relaxing there",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1409,Great hotel,40,October 2016,"Great mid priced hotel in Seminyak. Rooms were clean , bathroom was a little dated but still fine. Bed was fantastic and pillows to die for. Bottled water daily. Buffet breakfast daily which was a generous spread. Nice big Pool was beautiful and relaxing. Menu was reasonable priced and food was good. Two for one cocktails were a hit. Hotel is a little out of main seminyak area but they offer a free shuttle few times daily and also cheap cabs. I would recommend this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1410,"Amazing Hotel, however very isolated!!!",50,October 2016,"A really lovely hotel, clean, beautiful rooms. We took a family suite 3 bed 2 bath and priced. The pool area is amazing and room service is reasonably priced.
Unfortunately this hotel is in a remote area of Seminyak there is not much around so if you want to experience Bali this isnt the best place.
Its a short trip into Seminyak the hotel provides a car service but you will have to taxi back. The cost is around $50,000 idr However the hotel is self contained with a bar etc",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1411,1st Timers to Bali,50,September 2016,"The hotel surpassed what we expected we upgraded to a poolside room which made our stay perfect thanks to Brian, also all staff all very friendly and professional. We're only booked breakfast which was very different for us but enjoyable, didn't have many evening meals because we eaten out most nights but what we had was good.
The hotel was a 10min taxi ride to the upscale area of Seminyak which is full of quality bars and restaurants and trendy shops.
Will return to discover more we had a fantastic time.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1412,"Clean, friendly, reasonably priced",40,October 2016,"We came for 6 days, the place is lovely with a Great Outdoors area. The staff are friendly but the only thing we found a little annoying was when you ordered food or drink, they would come up to you with the bill to be paid for straight away rather than building up a tab of 4 rounds. So if paying by card is just a little annoying when you could just pay it at the end when finished. The cocktails are not very strong, but they are cheap. All in all the room was perfect and location is OK, close to Seminyak but you always have to pay 50,000 to get a taxi to Seminyak. No ubers allowed on the site they get bottles thrown out by waiting taxis.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1413,Fantastic Hotel,50,September 2016,I was at first very sceptical as I had read so many reviews that weren't good. We put them aside and made our own decision when we arrived. The hotel was fantastic. So clean and modern. We arrived late Sunday night and we were booked in quickly and taken straight to our room where we could go straight to sleep. The next day we went down to breakfast and the staff there are so lovely and take the time to interact with you and find out where your from etc and this was every day that we were there.. Couldn't fault the hotel and staff. My partner planned a romantic candlelit pool side dinner for me and the night was perfect. Our waiter Anand was amazing and the food faultless. Another staff member Era was so caring. When we said that I was sick she made me a nice hot lemon drink and didn't charge me for it which I thought was nice. We have had the best experience here and we will definitely be back as we loved it.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1414,hospitality was great,50,October 2016,"this is the cheapest hotel you would get that too at seminyak
but a reminder and idea for everyone going to bali for first time is hire a regular taxi and take bike rental to go to near by places
I would say everyone to blindly book this hotel they have a variety of cuisine for breakfast",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1415,Romantic candle lit dinner,50,September 2016,"We enjoyed a romantic candle lit dinner for 2 tonight and we were very impressed. The food was amazing and we couldnt be happier with the service. De Darmawan was fantastic tonight with his attentiveness.
He was very friendly and efficient
He made the night an awesome experience for us
We will definitely be doing this again",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1416,Good place to stay overall,40,September 2016,"We stayed in a deluxe room which was a decent size,had a (stained) small sofa,tea facilities,safe,fridge & daily complimentary water. Gym is good, pool is nice but doesn't have lots of sunbeds & the restaurant area looks over into pool which can be off putting if you're the one in the water !
Daily free shuttle takes you to seminyak square or beach but book early (ideally a day or two in advance). Breakfast is nice and also varied though many of the dishes are like things you'd eat at lunch!! Polite & welcoming staff,overall a good stay",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1417,Good cheap hotel,50,October 2016,Great hotel... Staff super friendly. 😁😁 Lovely pool. A bit far for those who like to walk everywhere but otherwise great 👍 could maybe do with a bit of updating but can't complain for the price 😁😁,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1418,Beautiful hotel & amazing service,40,October 2016,"One of the nicest hotels we have stayed at in Bali. Very reasonably priced... The rooms are clean and quite big. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The pool is amazing! The location is away from the hustle and bustle and requires a taxi ride into town.
I would highly recommend!
If you do go say hi to Ray in the bar, best cocktail maker you'll find!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1419,Awesome stay!,50,October 2016,"Just stayed at Ramada Encore with 5 of my friends for 9 nights and enjoyed every minute of it! The hotel has a lot to offer and even though not in the heart of seminyak square it is still close and easy to get to as hotel offers free shuttle or drivers to take you there or anywhere you want. The hotel is clean, the rooms are great and the pool is massive. Offers 2 for 1 cocktails every day from 3pm to 10pm which I certainly made the most of! Just want to say a huge shout out to the best bartender Reymond, he makes the best cocktails and is so make fun and creates an awesome atmosphere at the bar! All the staff are lovely, friendly and helpful. Definitely will recommend this hotel to anyone and I will be coming back to stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1420,1 week of a relaxing family holiday.,40,September 2016,"A small family friendly hotel. The breakfast didn't alter very much each day but was nice and had a good variety of items to choose from. Apart from an issue with the type of room we'd booked at the start, the 2 rooms we got in the end were ideal. Daughter cut her foot on a broken pool tile and when husband reported it they weren't very apologetic or asked how she was but the tile was fixed 2 days later. Interconnecting rooms are very convenient when travelling with young children. Beds are comfortable and large and bathrooms are nice. Slow bar service sometimes as is common in Bali hotels.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1421,great hotel and staff are fantstic,50,September 2016,"To remada we stayed at your lovely hotel in September the service was so lovely and we would like to thank very much to Dita, Reymoid and Dewi and everyone there for our great service they gave us. The facilities are all 5 star. The room was perfect and very comfy. The pool was aboustiy beautiful, breakfast was delishes. The entertainment was good and it a very short taxi ride to Legian and Kuta for a nice stroll. we got treated like royalty and we will be back very soon. We enjoyed our stay l had tears when l left because we got treated like family. miss you all so much",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1422,Great Hotel & Staff Martin Donaghy (London),50,September 2016,".Dear Remada,

I've just arrived back to London from a lovely break in the Encore Ramada.The facilities are all first rate!

But' any Hotel, it is only as good as the staff!! I found everyone of them very, very pleasant, from the Gardner to the Restaurant Manager.

The people I got to know the best were: ERA.In the restaurant were Dewi & Era

Ray-Ray & Dylan at the Bar: good singers!! :-)

Your personalities are all a great asset to this buildings success, I would return to see you all again one day!

The hotel is set away from the Seminyak, but this added to the stay. 4/5 mins in cab.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1423,Isolated... but Ideal,40,May 2016,"Although this property is a little removed from any of the buzzing activity areas, this may well suit a lot of people. You'll need a Taxi on most occasions when travelling to and from the Hotel, although it's possible to walk to Legian or Seminyak if you're fit and the avoid the mid-afternoon sun. A taxi to or from Kuta will cost you less than $4, so be generous to your driver if he provides a good friendly service. The property itself is relatively new, the rooms are well appointed and the the staff at reception are attentive and polite. Breakfast is reasonable, but not exceptional. WiFi in the room was a bit hit and miss, but not unlike the vast majority of Indonesian accommodation. In summary, pleasant stay, reasonable value for money, friendly staff, ample security and clean and presentable rooms.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1424,Pleasant and Enjoyable stay with amazing staff!,50,September 2016,"This is a good hotel but a few of their staff members make it great! Ask to be served by Dewi, Gita, Darma in the restaurant, Tita and Yuni at reception and all the ladies at the spa were very good too. I loved the pool design and it was very relaxing just hanging there. The restaurant staff mentioned above made me very comfortable ordering vegetarian/vegan meals. The room itself is very comfortable but their sheets and towels need to be renewed as even newly replaced ones had stains and looked tired but didn't deter me from using them, it's just an observation. I enjoyed my stay and would certainly stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1425,Unique hotel,30,October 2016,"Stayed here for 2 nights due to our cancelled flight. Room was modern, breakfast buffet shouldn't missed! Amazing Indonesian local food at the hotel's restaurant..even you order from room service they serve the same menu. It was very nice!!!
They have the cutest Swimming area to chill! I also noticed that the kids love to swim a lot here.
Don't forget the happy hour too! Strawberry Daiquiri and Lychee mojito :) Friendly staff but a bit slow when you called for Hskpg assistance. Overall nice property.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1426,Enchanting!,40,September 2016,"This was our first vacation to Bali with friends and had a very relaxed stay; pool view was remarkable- Big pool view. The service of the entire staff was of high standards; always courteous and soft-spoken, ready to help making our stay more worthwhile. The accommodation/rooms were well kept and cleaned on time. The Hotel transport was practically first-rate; specially the cab driver we hired-Duckling (one of the most soft spoken and helpful guy we met during our stay in Bali).

Food was scrumptious but sweet; would love it if you can have international cuisines (Specially Indian Cuisine) giving the number of Indian guest visiting and giving them more options & you should have Lunch & Dinner Buffets. The Hotel should hire an Indian Chef. In whole whatever we ate it was appetizing.

Looking forward to visit soon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1427,You Get What You Pay For!!!!,30,September 2016,"The room size is quite nice, but the bed is 2 twin beds pushed together with obvious gap. The towels like all hotels is used but this hotel's towels are used beyond repair and should be replaced. We did not use them as we felt they were just too old and no way clean enough to use on our faces and body. We did enjoy breakfast and was nice (was included in room rate). They have a lot of selections and you don't feel rushed if running a bit late to eat. The staff was friendly and even helped us contact a restaurant that had forgot our reservations. Overall we stayed 2 nights and the price was very reasonable and cheap, but as stated in the title you truly get what you pay for. We recommend the kid menu on room service lol but not the fruit yogurt platter. far too sour....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1428,Holiday,50,October 2016,"Can't wait to go back to the hotel to see Gita and the crew. Always make it welcomed stay. The rooms are well cleaned. The service from staff is always of high standards

Looking forward too seeing you all soon.

Great work Gita, and reymond your an assest to the company 😊",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1429,Captivating Pool and Delicious Food,50,May 2016,"I arrived at 10 pm and straight to my room after check in and not put attention hotel ambience and surrounding. But since i'm craving for food that night, i was order light snacks and chicken wings (recommended-it tasted good!) before i sleep. When i woke up and stand in the balcony, whoaaahhhh, i found out pool view is amazing from here! Big pool view with shore shape, bright blue water under the sun, with ""floating"" pool chair. Recommended for young couple or even family.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1431,Best hotel we have ever stayed at !,50,February 2016,"First of all, when my fiancé and I arrived at the hotel we were greeted with tea and a very warm welcome from the staff. We stay around a week, the hotel room was amazing so neat and tidy and very new the rooms with a comfy bed. We even preferred some days to just lay by the pool and enjoy the staff's company. Speaking of enjoying the staff's company Gede Pranajaya in particular we made friends for life, he was professional, polite, so friendly, always smiling and just a very good soul, he worked so hard also ensured we had our meals/drinks on time ! All the other staff were awesome too and would always greet us no matter what hour of the day/night it was! We were so sad to leave and will most definitely be back there as the overall experience was great!!!!

This is a good hotel in Seminyak",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1435,The Best hotel in Bali,50,September 2016,"Myself & my partner have visited Ramanda many times and we wouldn't go any where else, Why you ask because it really does have everything you need and want in a hotel 😀 Great clean rooms, beautiful pool & the surrounding are just beautiful 🌹🌹 The staff are amazing Two of my favorites are Tita & Ray, honestly guys if your looking for a affordable Hotel and you want 5 star treatment Ramanda is the hotel i would choose every time 🌟🌟🌟",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1437,Wonderful staff & service,50,September 2016,We booked our daughter into the Ramada in Bali after she'd had her belongings stolen whilst travelling around Bali. Thank you to the staff in the Ramada for all the support & help they offered us & our daughter. We would definitely use this hotel again. :),Primera Hotel Seminyak
1438,good hotel in Seminyak Bali,40,July 2016,i stayed for 3 days here. this is a good budget hotel. room is good enough with pool view. delicious breakfast with various menu beside swimming pool. recommended hotel and will come back again if i visit in Bali :),Primera Hotel Seminyak
1439,Descent Hotel,40,September 2016,"Pros:
- Budget Hotel
- Food is ok
- Pool view is good
- Semiyank Square is around 10 mins by cab

Cons:
- Rooms are not that clean
- Connectivity (One cannot walk into the hotel during evening as it's located in inside lanes with poor street lighting)
- Travelling by cab is required if you need to step out close by",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1440,"Terrible, not worth the trouble",10,September 2016,"When we first got to the hotel we noticed that is actually nowhere near Seminyak.
From the images we were expecting a relatively good hotel only to find that when we arrived they said it would take 3 hours to get out room ready.
We waited and when we got to the room, the sheets were filthy with stains all over them. The bathroom was dirty with the toilet being stained and looking like it has never been cleaned.
The food was not the greatest with them already charging extra when ordering room service but then charging an extra on top of that just to bring it to us. They almost charged us to take away the plates even though the food made us sick.
They have live entertainment at night which is great, but not so great when you've just flown in and want an early nights sleep. The entertainment went from 6pm to 11pm and you could hear everything from the room.
At 4am we were awoken to men screaming that it's leg day and they need to go to the gym. With constant people screaming about other things which could not be understood.
Overall this was the worst place ever and I've done a lot of travelling. We ended up finding another hotel and going there instead. They were however nice enough to give us a free lift to the other hotel as a sorry.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1441,Good budget hotel,30,September 2016,"I stayed here on two occasions, Both times the staff were very attentive and friendly.
We did end up with a lot of ants in our room, normal for a tropical climate yes, but the bed was overrun with ants making it impossible to sleep in. It did take three requests for them to come and spray the room and the reissue of dead ants was not cleaned away for the duration of the five night stay.
Other than that it was a pleasant stay, the pool is big and gets enough sun for the day. It is good value for money if you get a deal on the rooms. It is close to seminyak square and the shuttle is also really handy.
During our second stay, the hotel was a lot busier and some of the guests were exceptionally noisy at all hours of the day and night. it didn't spoil our stay but their brashness and loudness could have probably done with the staff having a word with them instead of being able to get away with it and disrespect the staff continuously.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1442,bad experience in seminyak,20,September 2016,"First on arrival no bill boys picked up our luggage from the taxi, i had to call someone to help me get the bags to the room, not organized at all, too much busy, can't sleep because of the noise in the drive through and finally rooms are not clean enough",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1443,Good hotel and comfortable room,50,September 2016,"The room was comfort, because i was in poolside room. Great bathroom. Reasonable price for the facilities. But no soundproof. You can hear the sound from room above you. The taste of the food is very good. You will like the taste of breakfast and food for your lunch and dinner. So it is nice to be in this hotel again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1444,still deciding,20,September 2016,Firstly the staff are very friendly and do try to help. Was disappointed with our room we payed for a pool access we got one but the photo on the web showed a pool ladder coming directly off your balcony which there was not one. You stepped out onto 5 inches of water. I think in total there was only 16 sun lounges so could never get one and when we did they were very hard and uncomfortable. Our fridge did not work properly we did ring reception and they sent someone down to our room and they said that the setting was wrong and he changed it but it didnt change at all in temperature. so we had to get ice in a bucket every nigh so that we could have a cold drink at the end of the day. They did try to charge us for it. The breakfast each morning was below standard in the end we just went with out and went to nearby Seminyak to eat. What I was most DISGUSTED in was when we got a blue taxi back to the hotel from Seminyak if there were other people waiting for a taxi to go somewhere the people at the foyer (I presume drivers working with the hotel) They would very rudely tell the taxi drivers to go and at one stage I heard one of the guys growl like a bear at the driver and then to proceed to tell the hotel guest that they were not a very good taxi. I certainly told the guests they they were in deed very good taxi service and very much cheaper than the drivers working with the hotel. From then on we would walk down the road and get a blue taxi I was so much cheaper than getting one of the hotel drivers. The restaurant staff and bar staff were remarkable I could not fault their service,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1445,Nice on a budget,30,September 2016,"Hotel staff were lovely, good location and great price for pool access rooms. There where a few small things that could have made the stay a really great experience though.
The food is not as good as it could be. Much, much better to be found outside the hotel a short trip away.
The pool deck chairs are actually very uncomfortable with no cushions on them or available. Also not really enough of them to go around.
The gym was near our room and despite signs asking patrons to not drop weights they still do and it was quite noisy at 7am each morning as well as being able to feel it in the bed and floors.
The bathroom was not as clean as it should be in a hotel.
Despite the above it really was a nice stay especially for the value and the staff were great.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1446,ripped off,10,September 2016,"Hi we stayed here, they charged us for pool towels, accussed us of stealing them and searched our bags, I rang 2 local numbers from my phone and was charged $37.50. Food and Drinks were slow and some we never got because they forgot. We asked for sweet popcorn and got popcorn with salt. I ordered a chicken parmi and it was a half a chicken breast cut in half with tomato sauce and cheese on top. A kids size meal. 5 mouth fulls of chicken. Wont recommend this place to anyone and wont go back there. I have been to Bali 7 times and this place was crap",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1447,Slow service,30,September 2016,"Stayed a night at ramada encore and although the rooms are lovely and very clean, their service is by far the slowest I've come across in Indonesia as a whole. Everything seems to happen at snails pace been if you ask multiple times. Very frustrating and disappointing considering customer service in Bali is always on point. You guys should either employ more staff or really get behind the ones you have.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1448,Nice hotel great food need taxi or shuttle out off way,30,September 2016,"Would I stay again properly not
Had upgrade to superior room
Was back of hotel in the corner small room view not great at all
No where to dry towel bathers extra
Staff were beautiful
Not a huge pool for the amount of rooms",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1449,About to visit this hotel,40,September 2016,This is a previsit review. I head to the hotel in Early October after a Bali absence of 12 years. I'm super excited and it will be my first overseas trip with my 14 yo son. It will be his first bali visit and my sisters. We are aussies. The reviews I have read below concern me a little with the cleanliness of the hotel. I am curious about the buffet breakfast. Can anyone who has recently visited or stayed at the hotel advise how it was for range and quality?,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1450,Pleasant but would not go back - poor hygiene,30,September 2016,"Upon arrival to bali, our luggage had been left in our stopover which had not placed us in the best mood, so we were hoping that our transition to our hotel, along with our check in would be a smooth ride. However, this was not the case. We had paid for a superior double room with 2 queen beds, which in england are 2 double beds, but in bali apparently these are 2 single beds; the pictures also showed a balcony which was not what the room was. The state of our room was also shocking, dirty bedding, dirty floor, not acceptable. We went back down to the reception (1 am in the morning) to ask about this and they laughed in our faces and were extremely patronising, we asked to be moved but they had no rooms until the following day so they sent housekeeping up to change our beds and tidy up, we waited half an hour in reception; went back up to find they had merely straightened up the beds and not changed the actual bedding. We were extremely tired after a full 24 hours of travelling and getting upset that this was happening. I called back down to reception and told them, they were not apologetic at all and sent someone back up to change the beds again. At this point i felt deflated. Our arrival to Bali had been the worst possible. Once the bedding had been changed, we went to bed to sort it out in the morning. As soon as i woke up i went back downstairs to be greeted by a lovely woman on reception who listened to the whole story of what happened and was extremely apologetic and spoke to the manager who offered us a free upgrade to our rooms to a pool view room. One problem sorted which we felt happy about and could relax and enjoy our holiday. The quality of cleanliness & housekeeping is extremely poor - they changed our beds once throughout our stay (2 weeks), rarely changed our towels even though we left them on the floor of the bathroom and if they did give us new ones they'd only give us one so we'd have to call down. The overall state of the room was below standards, we had to accept the fact we were going to have stains on our sheets. One night we ordered room service to which there was a long hair in the pizza. Really hampered our view. However, the pool & poolside service is lovely. If ordering a taxi, ask reception to call you a blue bird rather than using the hotel taxi service which is ridiculously overpriced.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1451,Worth the rate charged,30,September 2016,"Room is small, Hotel needs some cleanliness. Breakfast is good. Can say that the money charged for the room is okay comparing to the facilities provided. Location is not good because its hard to reach the street by walk especially in the afternoon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1452,Poor hygiene,30,September 2016,"On arrival, we were given the key to our 'Queen bed, superior room'. Which besides the pictures and the description, this is the most basic room with single beds, not double queens as expected.
When we got there it was a dingy room at the back of the hotel, with no balcony access and dirt on the sheets and in the bathroom. We went down and complained and had to wait 30mins for the sheets to be changed to where we were sent upstairs and the sheets were the same sheets. 30mins later, another cleaner came to change our sheets. Bare in mind we had been travelling for 24hours, it was 1am and we had to wait an hour for clean sheets.

When complaining the next morning we were upgraded to a pool side room which was massively appreciated, however hygiene was still a massive issue. The sheets were always covered in some sort of stain and it basically became a game of what stains you could live with in the end. One of my sheets had blood spots on it and the bathroom towels smelt unclean the whole time.

You could see the dirt in the bathroom and the overall hygiene of the room was below standards.

Apart from this, the pool and service was great and the hotel itself was lovely decor.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1453,Good place for an overnight stay,40,September 2016,"This a good place to stay overnight on the way to other places as its not close to anything unless you have transport. Good budget price accomodation for a modern hotel. Room is comfortable, free Wifi and Buffet breakfast is good.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1454,Poor hygiene!,10,September 2016,"This is the fourth time in a row that we visit the Ramada encore. Unfortunately the maintenance and hygiene of the hotel is not up to standards anymore. We still have another 8 nights to go but regret staying here for a total duration of 15 nights. The bathroom is just not clean enough. We also discovered a ""ball"" of hair inside our ""fresh"" towels (as in picture). Too bad the quality went down like this.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1455,Good place to stay,40,September 2016,"Reasonable price for all the facilities you get. Cozy room (spacious), great bathroom, but no soundproof. Almost everytime you can hear your neighbour doorbells, and you can hear the sound of the lift. But still a great place to stay, definitely will stay here when i visit Bali again.

1456,The worst hotel I've never been.,10,August 2016,"Quality rooms : the rooms were dirty . Bugs pests : there were ants all over the room . We stayed twice at a time through and the two rooms that had given us a nest of ants. A real plague. Not to mention mosquitoes. It was one day enter and make a killing . We estimate that killed more than 12 mosquitoes. The customer service is terrible : we left a towel and a bathing suit and we need to call up to 4 times for us to watch him until our return to the hotel a few days later .
In the pool does not get sun : if what you want is not to get dark , this is your hotel. I do not advise it for anything. Typical tourist hotel with pretensions and no care.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1457,Family friendly away from the busy bits,30,September 2016,Facilities / common areas are great with plenty of space for laze about the pool and bar area. Restaurant and front of house staff fantastic and very friendly. Bar staff reasonably slow in getting our drinks. Rooms fresh and mostly clean. We had issues with the drain in our shower which was a pain. We would have preferred something i little closer to the beach but it was very easy to grab a taxi from directly out the front for a quick trip to the markets or beaches. We booked a room with poolside access and it was great to be able to wonder in and out,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1458,Great place to stay,50,September 2016,"We were two families with small kids. This was a perfect place with a nice swimming pool for kids to enjoy, very helpful staff and around 10 minutes from beach(on car).

Overall we had a wonderful experience at the hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1459,It was PERFECT!!,50,August 2016,"Me and my little family absolutely love this place!! The hotel it self is hidden down the alley-ways so it's a much quieter location. You walk in to a beautiful reception area and then get greeted by very friendly staff members. Once you check in you walk through the restaurant/bar area and then you pass this humongous pool...its glorious 😇 Our rooms were very nice and modern. However the bathrooms were just a little out dated - but saying that, I absolutely loved the shower and how big it is! Once you find your room and dump your bags, the first place we all go straight for is the pool!! Love this pool, it has a small kiddy pool area as well as a huge swimming area for the adults. The food and drinks are also delicious here! A big BIG shout out to the bar staff RayRay and Reja!! You guys made that place! If you do decide to stay here reader, please make sure to sit at the bar and say hi to these guy while they make you an awesome mojito 😉. Also I have to say a big thank you to my girl Dewi from the hotel restaurant, She is amazing and always made me feel that extra bit special by greeting me by name everyday with a big beautiful smile! Thanks Encore Ramada!! We will be back soon 😌💆🏽🙃",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1460,Great place,50,August 2016,"A wonderful place to stay at, great value for money nice food and great staff! Aris one of the young boys there he was amazing he was willing to learn English and try his hardest to interact with customers.
He was very enthusiastic and always had a smiley he place is wonderful and having great staff there always makes it more inviting.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1461,Cool For Young People,30,June 2016,"The first time i come to this hotel, i almost don't believe i'm in a right way. cause it's located in a private villa area. it's impossible to find high building. but it is.

i enter the lobby, modern enough. my room is cool. nailed it. compact enough.

i just love the breakfast ambience. super warmth, sunbath by a rising sun the food is delicious. the pool is very large",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1462,Excellent value for all that we had,50,September 2016,"The hotel staff went the extra mile to make us feel comfortably at home. Superb breakfast with a good variety of cold and warm dishes (in most days we were full enough to not have lunch). Our son enjoyed a lot the swimming pool for kids and the kids club. à la carte food is exceptional and for a good price. Our room had a good space, overlooking the pool and with all amenities any guest would like to have in a hotel of such a category. but indeed we can't say enough that the staff was really great, always with a warm welcoming face. We are coming back for sure.

Not sure if because there were a lot of pros, but honestly we can't think of a negative side during our stay... well, perhaps, too short stay???",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1463,3 bedroom is great,50,September 2016,"Staying in this hotel with friends. located in the Seminyak Area. We stayed in 3 bedrooms suite that has direct access to pool. 3 bedroom,kitchenette,hude fridge, and 2 bathroom was great.Breakfast was excellent wih variety of menus.Thank
you Ramada Encore.sure we""ll back to this Hotel again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1464,Great Hotel,50,September 2016,"This hotel was one of the cheaper hotels we have stayed in at Semiyak, and it was absolutely beautiful. The staff are so lovely the hotel was very clean, we had a pool access room and i would not fault anything about it. We went over with a group of friends but if you are looking for a little family holiday with children i would also highly recommend the Encore. The breakfast was beautiful and the spa was amazing.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1465,Good beds. Poor service,10,September 2016,"The service was very poor. Every time I ordered anything from the menu or bar I was hassled to pay immediately. I was not allowed to charge anything to my room.
Half bottles of wine were on the menu, but when ordered were not available.
There were shuttles advertised but only two per day. When I inquired about the morning shuttle I was told it was booked out. Couldn't the driver make 2 trips? Was I the only one who missed out.
Lights were changed in the restaurant at 10 minutes to 2. They started polishing the floor at the same time. Couldn't they wait until after people finished their lunch?
Coffee on the stand was lukewarm each day at breakfast, and the warmer was turned off.
The pool was very good, but when you asked for a towel they referred you to reception for a towel card. Perhaps they could give you the card at checkin or tell you about it or put it in the room book, along with the promised room service menu which was also missing.
The bad and the pillows were very comfortable",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1466,Poor assistance,10,September 2016,"We have a long stay (15nights) in this hotel at the moment. Now we are on our 3rd nights. We asked through the hotel to rent a motorcycle on the day we checked in, we finally got one, but today the motorcycle has a flat tyre, I asked the hotel to help me because we've already paid full for the cycle, but the hotel said they can't help us because today is a ceremonial day. I understand about the ceremonial day, but the hotel still have to be able to assist their guest and solve this problem.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1467,Great stay,50,September 2016,I just got back from this hotel and was looking forward to reviewing. I just had a read through others' reviews and wanted to share my experience. I stayed here with a group of friends for a wedding and trusted one to book for us and she found the Ramada Encore Bali. For the price we paid I certainly feel like we had value for money - my expectations sat much lower based on cost but they exceeded my expectations. The room was clean and the air con was strong - two of the most important elements for me. The pool was great - the sun beds in the water is a genius idea and made for lazing by the pool very pleasant (particularly during happy hour) and the beds were in sunlight pretty much all day so great for tanning. The breakfast was also fantastic - lots of choice and really provides the value for money for this place. Would stay here on a return visit to Bali. Thanks for a pleasant stay.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1468,Great stay,40,September 2016,Staff are wonderful. Upgraded us from two deluxe to a family suite which meant walking out onto our balcony and straight into the pool. No request was too hard. Even ordering items note the menu due to sick family members. Staff were very accommodating. Buffet breakfast is not really catered for western tastes but again staff were happy to make eggs and bacon for us. Plenty of options with cereal pastries and fresh fruit also. Spa is very good value for money. 2 hour package for $25 can't get better than that. Gita is a server is the restaurant/bar and provides amazing customer service. Asks you name at her first meeting and refer to you by name for your entire stay.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1469,Very nice and clean hotel,40,August 2016,This hotel is very nice and peaceful. Is recommended to people that doesn't want crowded like in Kuta or Legian. The breakfast was good and complete. View on breakfast was amazing and also the pool was amazing.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1470,Terrible service,10,September 2016,"Terrible. Asked for quiet room and got a room above bar with loud music continuously on and they refused to change me to a better room. Bed sheets did not look like they had been changed found several hair on bed, and couch with multiple stains and room smelt like someone had been smoking in it. Just not on.

They have no information booklet or leaflet on tours except for a list of places to go to pick from with no info.

Never received the welcome drink I was meant to get using the card.

Would never consider staying there again, of all the places I stayed at in Bali that's the worst by far.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1471,The pool is lush!,50,August 2016,"Title says it all. The pool is fantastic. The reason we picked the hotel in fact. Sun beds are set in a shallow section of the pool so all you need to do is wiggle a foot to have it drop into the water.

Also the bar is ""right there"". Which bar? Both the pool bar and the main restaurant bar are both right there so depending where in the pool you happen to be floating you can get to either easily.

We didn't pay extra to have poolside rooms, but were pretty decided that if we came back we would.

Setting the pool aside (difficult!) the room is modern and clean. Shower, TV and air con are all really good (and I'm pretty picky in these things normally).

Overall a great hotel.

My only comment would be its location. For my wife and I the walk into Seminyak was only a little ""hair raising"".

The paths from the hotel to town are non existent, so you share the road with a storm of scooters, motorbikes and taxi's. Like I said, a bit exciting for a pair of twenty-something young adults, but older people and children are going to be dependant on taxi cabs or the hotel shuttle for getting into the main town. Thankfully local taxi cabs are cheap, just make sure you pick a blue bird taxi as they use a meter.

Other taxi cabs can try some old tricks to rob you of your hard earned. On that note, don't use the free lance money changers on the high street. One tried to slight of hand me out of £20.

Only use the money changing offices with glass doors and A\C that give you a receipt. There is Is one in the entrance of bintang supermarket and one on the opposite side of the road and slightly to the right (which had a better rate - we used this one).

Both the local taxis and the money exchangers are common fraudsters in Bali - so watch out and be alert wherever you end up staying!

Don't let that reflect on the hotel though, those guys were great!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1472,Excellent!,40,August 2016,"We just stayed here for two weeks for our first visit for Bali and had a fantastic time.

Staff were amazing, very friendly and sorted out any issues straight away.

Food was really good. Great selection for breakfast and had a good restaurant with really reasonable prices.

Pool was fantastic. However a few more sunbeds that were not in the water would have been good.

A great hotel and I would highly recommend.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1473,Great hotel,50,August 2016,"First time at this hotel and have to admit what we paid was an absolute bargain, great pool and amazing staff can't help you out enough and it's a very relaxed atmosphere will definitely be back in the future..................................",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1474,Very nice,50,August 2016,"This hotel is lovely, it was nice and peaceful. The staff were so lovely. The breakfast was amazing as well as the view while enjoying the food. The room was always cleaned. The shuttle was very helpful to get around. On my partner's birthday, Tita and Hermanto did a great job to surprise him. It was very much appreciated. Everything was beautiful. Many Thank you Tita and Ramada staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1475,Bargain,50,August 2016,"We got this little Beauty for under $60 p/n with breaky and you honestly can't fault it!

Rooms are spacious than most with a little lounge in there as well which catered for the perfect bed for our 4yo!

They have tea/coffee robes toothbrushes soap etc in the rooms as well as an empty bar fridge which you can fill!

The pool is massive it's the best the only suggestion is it needs more pool chairs!

The breakfast had a good selection and the food there was also good and really reasonably priced for a hotel!

The spa is great too go for the massage and facial package it is heaven on earth 👌

All in all we really enjoyed it here and the staff were great, we will return!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1476,Great little find,50,August 2016,"Great value resort, it's a little bit out of town but the staff and the facilities really make up for it :) Definitely worth upgrading to either a pool side or pool access room for the small amount extra.The breakfast included is decent enough.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1477,Value for money,40,August 2016,"Stayed here for a week and we loved it.
Brekky was huge and a big variety, staff were amazing, pool was awesome.
It was away from town but i preferred that but for some might be too far. It took us 20 min to walk which i didnt think was too bad. Will definitely recommend to family and friends",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1478,Great Rooms for Families,40,April 2016,"I'm finally getting around to reviewing this hotel after 6 months! We stayed here during the April school holidays for 4 days and then moved to Sanur for 4 days. I loved the suite we had. It had a kitchen, lounge, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a balcony. The balcony was small but enough for 2 to sit and have a drink while the drying rack was next to us. We stayed with a family of 4 and the kids loved having their own rooms. The lighting in the room was very bad and it was hard to see but we weren't inside that much. I really liked the pool and although the bar was not swim up, they were happy to come to the pool side to take your order, Strangely they ran out of pool towels on more than one occasion so I took the extra towels out of our room to use. Happy hour cocktails from a set list were all day so it wasn't really happy hour but happy selection! There were some nice ones there so for less than $5 each I certainly tried a few! Breakfast was fine, nothing to rave about but the usual selection.
The massages in the hotel were excellent and for around $18AUD the convenience was worth the price. I also used the gym which was comfortable.
Yes it's a bit far off the main drag of Seminyak but just grab a blue bird or the shuttle and you're there. The staff try to push the hotel transport but that's usual.
All in all I'd go back, it would be perfect for an affordable ladies weekend away!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1479,Excellent value for money,40,August 2016,"We stayed at the Ramada Encore hotel for 4 nights and our stay was very pleasant. I would like to mention a staff member by the name of Tita who added that extra touch of service and decorated our room for my birthday. She also provided us with information about the local area and where we could eat and shop. Yuni and Brian were also very helpful. The pool was clean and very inviting and overall for the amount we paid, we got more than we expected. The spa service at the hotel was excellent and I had a massage there twice. I would stay here if I visited Bali again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1480,ramada encore - August 2016,40,August 2016,"Nice hotel with lovely and friendly staff. The rooms are great and the pool view is even better. However, the food isn't the best. Would recommend taking a taxi or walking into Seminyak or somewhere close to get dinner. Apart from that, overall happy with the stay :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1481,Would recommend for relaxing,40,August 2016,"We are a young couple who stayed 2weeks, the hotel has an amazing pool and a oasis surrounding it. Its quiet and good for people who want to get away from noise and just relax. If u are a party person but want a bit of both, this works too because kuta and seminyak is close and the hotel offers free shuttle there and u only pay $10 for a driver to get back. A lot of kids nd families but they didnt bother us. The breakfast buffe is amazing, the hotel has good coffe in the bar, we dont drink alcohol but we ordered food from room service and the restaurant a few times. I LOVE the migoren and pasta.. Dont come here for pizza or burger. We ordered dessert our last night and room service said it would be 20min, after 1hr and nothing i called. Then they came but after eating the tirmisu and fried ice cream my partner got sick, so not happy with that. But we loved everything else and would come back. The superior room was a bit small but that is what we paid for and next time we will book a delux room to get the balcony !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1482,Very slow service!,20,August 2016,"Hotel staff wore nice enough but very untrusting , every time I'd order an extresmlly overpriced drink they'd ask my name&room number and take 20 mins to get back to me, the shuttle was always full. The ""double bed"" is just 2 singles pushed together , tv had no reception and the lounge area that got any sun could only seat about 8 people out of the 400 staying",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1483,Good stay!!!,40,July 2016,"First time visiting this hotel, relaxing stay with great staff especially Adele who was our waiter most days and nights. She was really friendly and made sure we where looked after well. Pool was good and rooms are well kept. We will visit again for sure and yes the breakfasts are good like everyone is saying!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1484,Not that good,30,August 2016,"Location: Hidden in a dark area 10 min from the city and the nearest supermarket.

Lobby and restaurant: Great.

Staff: Welcoming, some don't understand English very well. Some of them were really racists especially in the restaurants.

Rooms: Dusty, with lots of dirty spots in the room and toilet.

Housekeeping service: Not very kind. Not all the things are available all the time and they might not give you what you need (like we asked for more sugar for the tea and they didn't give us and we asked for a Trash bin and they said that they don't have any!!) When they ought to clean the room they just made the bed :P . They didn't put new soap, towels or remove the waste from the room. Very poor in general.

In general: 4/10",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1485,"Beautiful hotel, amazing setting",50,August 2016,"On the positive side the surrounding pool, the food for breakfast, the entertainment at night. A distance to walk to any shop which is fine if you don't shops within walking distance.

On the negative: for a new hotel the toilet was always dirty, dirty grey towels. It is a taxi ride to anything (not bad if you like a long walk to the shops).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1486,Our Ramada stay,40,August 2016,"We have stayed in ramada for more than 3 times, the best things are the bed, the breakfast (so many types of food are offered), the pool is huge , staffs are friendly. The bathroom needs improvement as sometimes during check in they dont clean in properly.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1487,Very good stay for budget travelers,40,April 2016,"The rooms were clean and spacious. The bathroom sink had a slight drainage issue during our stay, but it was fixed by room service before we had call housekeeping. The hotel staff were extremely helpful in organizing transport (booking cabs and renting out bikes). The only downside was the poor cooling of the bar fridge in the room, but could live with it as we were paying for budget accommodation!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1488,Dirty toilet,20,August 2016,"We arrived on August 13th and stay here until 17th. Since we came to our room till now the toilet still the same, dirty. They never clean it, smell bad if we didn't turn on the fan. And they don't give us refill of body soap. Other than that hotel is ok.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1489,Honeymoon in Bali,50,June 2016,Great Experience at Ramada Encore. Lovely welcome by staff and our room was the best pick and location (we had a pool side room so close to the pool & restaurant). Loved the pool and most of all we loved the Massage services! Breakfast was ok at first because we had to get used to a majority Asian selection but after a few days we warmed to the wide range on offer. Other then that our stay was great. Room Service Menu needs to be reviewed though as a lot of the western choices didn't come out the same as described.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1490,Staff was pleasant and tried to please but communication needs improving ...,40,June 2016,"Room was pleasant and clean, although the lighting was dim. I could have used better lighting.

Amenities were fantastic; pool and dining area. Had everything for breakfast; continental, cook to order, Chinese, Balinese, plus much more. Great way to start the day!

Staff was pleasant and tried to please; however, the answer ""yes"" was given often without understanding the questions--ugh!!!

Management needs better training to implement: 1) procedures and 2) customer sensitivity. Although the problem was eventually resolved it took a bit of doing. I have learned to speak up if something does not seem right. Please contact me if you want more information.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1491,"Modern hotel, quiet location",40,July 2016,"Nicely equipped rooms, very good breakfast buffet and you can sit outside enjoying your breakfast. Modern equipped hotel with lots of colours in design. Helpfull staff ; good drivers to help you to Seminyak.
Its a pity you cannot walk to the beach due to the badly lighted roads in the evening. There is a shuttle 3x per day to Seminyak Square.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1492,Great stay (hot Beer),40,August 2016,"Great Stayat hotel, Great staff !!!except room fridges are crap!! don't expect to keep anything cold, we had 2 rooms both same!!! pool bar could not keep up with cold Bintang Beer, Beer was hot !! , Main bar warm beer also!!!! Credit to Staff would put beer in ice for me THANK YOU STAFF",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1493,A great one week stay 😊,50,August 2016,"We stayed at the ramada encore in a group of five- my husband and I, my parents and mother in law. We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we're sad to leave. The best things about this hotel are definitely the pool and the staff. The pool and dining area is one of a kind and really spectacular. You could easily spend a day there relaxing. Secondly the staff are simply amazing, especially the restaurant/bar staff and the spa ladies. Always smiling and remembering us and nothing was too difficult. We tried most of the spa treatments and all were 10/10. The only downfalls to this hotel are the cleanliness of the bathrooms (grout etc quite discolored) and the loud noises of people walking past the rooms (tiles). It is a little out of the way but taxis are always waiting and it is nice to get away from the hustle and bustle. Thank you to all the staff for our great stay!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1494,Excellent!,40,August 2016,"The Ramada encore is a fantastic hotel and great value for money.

The hotel rooms are spacious and clean and I cannot rate the staff more highly. All staff members are extremely friendly and helpful.

I got a massage from the spa - absolutely fantastic and great value for money! Definitely a must do if staying there.

Unfortunately the hotel is far away from other things but the shuttle service is good and a taxi back from seminyak square only cost 20,000rp.

The food is not the best, but OK for what you pay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1495,One week visit August 2016,50,August 2016,"From my experience - third time there this year because.....

For me it is simple - great value for money (I book through Agoda though).

The staff are always smiling and helpful (and remember my name).

The rooms are excellent. I prefer a room with balcony overlooking pool area but you can get ones right next to pool too. Nice big bed (even though they join two together), good size bathroom, ac works properly, safe, decent plasma, balcony.

Nice pool and chill out area - good for all ages.

Still close to everything but you sort of escape a bit too when you get back to hotel - hope that made sense.

Tips.
1. Get extra room key for ac so room is cool when you get back (I'm sure everyone already knows this)
2. If you can ride a scooter hire one because it is about a 20 minute walk up to the main street through Bali.
3. Breakfast is worth it. You can ask for poached eggs and bacon too. Speak to the omlette chef. Chocolate covered pastries are delicious too.
4. Say ""Ramada Encore Seminyak off Kunti"" when taxi or directions.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1496,Excellent service,50,August 2016,"We stayed in Ramada Encore, Seminyak for 4 days on our visit in Bali. It is a great hotel. The staff is very friendly and courteous and their breakfast spread is lavish and huge.... by huge I mean they have a buffet breakfast with 2 live counters and a huge choice of items from soups, salads, fruits, to fried rice noodles, eggs, breads, pastries and much more. They have a very decent pool and the rooms are quite large with very comfortable beds. We were a party of four and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. We stayed in August beginning and the hotel was packed with a very decent crowd. Mostly families. We got a very reasonable deal by booking online. The only minus point is that the hotel is a bit away from the road. But we had booked a private vehicle from Balijavaholidays to take us sightseeing around Bali so we didn't have much trouble getting around. They gave us a great deal for seeing most of our itinerary and the driver Bobby was our warmhearted, English speaking, friend cum guide cum driver. Recommend stay at Ramada Encore while you are in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1497,"Best reception and service, restaurant needs to improve.",40,August 2016,"The door from the restaurant during lunch and dinner is not really fresh and tasty. Although the reception was super friendly and they are willing to do everything. From making a reservation at a restaurant nearby to renting a scooter.
Tita, receptionist, was perfect.
The pool is nice and the gym was reasonable okay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1498,Don't get what you paid for!!!!!,10,July 2016,"Booked through Flight centre a 3 bedroom family suite. We specifically wanted 3 bedrooms for a reason. Arrived to be told family suite not available as air conditioning not working. When my husband asked to see the room we were then told that the room had been double booked. Turns out it had been doubled booked since March when originally booked it.....this was confirmed by flight centre who checked the room had been booked in Feb 2016 by someone else and we booked in March......As compensation we were given 3 seperate rooms, a free dinner, late check out and free hotel transfer..That was suppose to compensate for the ruined holiday....as I said we wanted a 3 bedroom suite for a reason. We would have left the hotel there and then but we had other family members staying there because we were. We have made a complaint to flight centre as the hotel told us they had informed Flight centre 2wks prior but flight centre said they did not receive anything until the day we checked in. So the hotel gets away with it.......
I agree with other comments the hotel staff are lovely and are the only asset this place has. It is too far away from everything. The room we were given had not been cleaned in quite awhile and even when we spoke to the Manager, nothing was done...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1499,Wonderful,40,August 2016,"The staff at this hotel are the biggest selling point, they are wonderful and can't do enough to help you. The food is also very good and a very reasonable price. Room was good and the communal areas are very well looked after. We would definitely recommend and would visit again",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1500,GREAT HOTEL BUT CLEANING STANDARDS ARE POOR,40,August 2016,"Just spent a week at the Ramada for resort that is two years old, it wasn't bad, but in a year or two will be badly run down and in need of renovation.
Excellent was the Swimming Pool & Pool Access Rooms, and general tidiness outside the room/ The staff were all very friendly and well presented. Shuttle was a great service too. Gym was basic but was sufficient. Breakfast was ample and there was a variety which kept you going until dinner time - probably catered more for the Asian pallet.
Disappointments: Cleanliness of our room - the shower was mouldy, basin dirty as was the toilet - needs a good clean with some domestos or shower power on a weekly basis. The room is not cleaned properly at all. The basin/toilet and shower are just rinsed.
The lighting was poor too - lights are positioned in the wrong areas - not over basin or mirror, which was odd.
Our water, glasses & towels were never topped up correctly. We would always receive one item short on a daily basis.
Staff: Brian at reception was our saviour - assisted whenever he could. Restaurant staff were all very friendly and made an effort to say hello and have a chat.
Location: about a 20 minute walk to Seminyak - crossing sunset Road - could be dangerous if you have little ones!!
My advice, stock up on the correct cleaning products and you would have a top notch resort and ensure staff are aware of how many guests are staying in each room, so they can stock up accordingly.
thank you for an enjoyable stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1501,"Remada Encore hotel in Seminyak, Bali",30,August 2016,"The swimming pool is amazing, the rooms are pretty good. The food and the workers are awesome and very helpful. The only problem we had was the lack of cleanliness in our rooms - they need to train their cleaners a lot better. Also there are NO drink glasses in any of the rooms, and the 3 bedroom apartments that have kitchen sinks in - they don't supply dishwashing detergent, dish towels to wash or wipe dishes, and again NO drink glasses. The workers, food and swimming pool would be the only reason I would come back again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1502,"Too many smokers, in a non smoking hotel",40,August 2016,"This hotel has a lot going for it, great location,pool area is lovely, staff very good. Food & drink is reasonable, also the spa is great value. Breakfast spread excellent.
BUT,the one thing I really didn't like was the hotel allowing customers to smoke while other people are eating, next to children, even saw people smoking in the pool. The staff turn a blind eye. When we booked this hotel, it was advertised as a non smoking hotel??!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1503,Excellent Staff,50,July 2016,"This resort is out of the way, you need to cab or scooter - which didn't bother us, as the family wanted to relax before coming back to the freezing cold Melbourne.

Excellent Staff - always professional, helpful and very polite.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1504,Excellent value!! Amazing pool!,40,September 2015,"You cannot beat the price and value of this hotel in Seminyak! Amazing value and although you have to catch a taxi to be in the centre of Seminyak (you wouldn't want to cross that highway walking), it's so cheap it doesn't matter!

A little away from the beach, but you use the hotel shuttle or hire a bike for very low rentals and ride to the beach.
Very economical for the quality and services provided.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1506,Good All Round Hotel....Great for the Money..,40,July 2016,"Staff are very friendly & Helpful,room was modern & clean,Bed & Pillows were super comfortable however don't believe the maps,it is a lot further to Seminyak than it shows.
The hotel does help out with shuttle services but not enough of them.
There is a lack of service around the pool & not enough pool lounges.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1507,Great value hotel with excellent staff,50,July 2016,"My partner and I recently spend a few days here and were very pleased. The restaurant/pool area was lovely, our room was comfortable, and the service was great. All of the staff we encountered were delightful and very helpful.

Initially when I was booking this hotel I was hesitant because it seemed to be quite far from the beach and main street of Seminyak, but the hotel has a free shuttle service, and a taxi only cost about $5 Australian dollars anyways.

The buffet breakfast was great and there was a huge variety of food for a reasonable price. However, the bbq dinner was less impressive and cost more, so I would recommend heading into town where there is a better variety of restaurants and cafes.

Overall I was impressed with the service and facilities of Ramada Encore for what was a fairly cheap price. Thanks for a great holiday!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1508,Family size rooms,40,June 2016,"Great cheaper option for a family with a large 3 bedroom family room King, Queen, 2 x singles large balcony over looking the pool, also available waters edge, kitchenette stove top and full size fridge. A little out of the action but free shuttle on offer or a car 50,000 into Seminyak ($5). Many asians on tour in this hotel. Eggs and bacon on request cooked fresh for breaky. Get in early for a towel and keep it all day as they run out by the afternoon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1509,Shocking and Dirty rooms.,10,July 2016,We arrived on the 23rd July from a flight from Australia. First I made a booking on booking.com when I was in Australia telling them flight details and arriving at 1 am. Asked them to pick me up airport shuttle. Arrived really tired no car anywhere. Had to get a taxi there arrived no sorry nothing. There were a group of Indians rich 6 of them complaining about the size of the rooms they had booked huge arguments. Waited 45 minutes to be checked in. Then I got told as I was checking in eat Morning there would be $100 fee. So tired and my Daughter paid for 3 nights. Got to the room at 3 am. The room stank it was filthy and small. Went back up to complain and change rooms and I would cancel my booking. They put us in another room filthy and stank. Security came to get my luggage from the other room waited 45 minutes 4 am now. Went to complain again and went to the old biosEcurity going to the toilet. Back in New room showed filthy got to bed at 5 am. Got up at 9 am to have buffer breakfast loud fall party music by the pool and pins groups of them. I got 2 nights refund this is place was he'll. Do not stay here.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1510,Great value for money,40,July 2016,"Definitely recommend staying here. A little out from main Seminyak area, taxis about $3 to get to Seminyak square. Stayed in deluxe pool side room, room was clean and spacious with a large walk in shower. Great room as you walk out of your room and after a few steps your in the pool. At check in you can choose to do a room bond or pay as you go. Food at restaurant had good variety from pizza pasta burgers ribs. Staff really were amazing even greeting me by my name every day.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1511,Tucked Away,40,July 2016,"The hotel is off the main drag of hotels in Seminyak. Small almost boutique style hotel is really quite beautiful for it's size apart from the lobby that is.
They have utilized the available space they had very well to accommodate a large pool.
Be early to breakfast otherwise it can get quite crowed after 9am, the selection at breakfast is limited but tasty. Room service menu is pretty standard but the food is once again tasty with quite fast service. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The beds gave you a good nights sleep and the linen was nicer than the usual fair.
This hotel is definitely value for money. Only real draw back is you always have to take a taxi to get anywhere. Tip order a bluebird taxi from reception as the hotel transport is expensive.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1512,"Lovely staff, tired hotel",30,July 2016,"This hotel was a little tired. Housekeeping was lacking, with our group often having to request replacement towels, toilet paper and our laundry back etc. Perhaps the staff were all new recruits. Corridors were gloomy and in need of a refresh, sheets and towels were clean, if not snow white. For us as over 50's - it is a bit far out of town to comfortably walk in the heat, so you might want to figure transport into your budget. There is a free shuttle if the time slots fit into your itinerary. We found the staff friendly and polite and willing to assist where possible.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1513,"""FANTASTIC""",50,February 2016,"I've been in Bali for 7 months and have stayed at several hotels around the island from mid to high price ranges . I choose to stay at the Ramada Encore for 6 months continually for many many positive reasons. When you are on vacation one thing that seals the vacation deal is the hotel staff and people that you interact with on a daily bases. The Ramada Encore in Seminyak has the best staff ever.....from the General Manager Dian Desiana , the Office manager Arik, Food and beverage manager Sunar to all the staff member in every different area. From exceptional leadership comes exemplary teams and this hotel has both. All I can say is WOW.... The attention they provide to their family (guests) is over and above..... They care truly care... They look after your needs .....to enjoying the island and all it has to offer to your health your safety and everything else. If you feel you require anything at all ........all you need to do is ask and it will be solved made available or arranged.
From staying at 15 different hotels on the island of Bali.... I am honoured to say and make Ramada Encore and their team my home and family. Thanks to all of you ......I just can't say enough........
And of course the value is nothing but exceptional the hotel is new the pool is large clean and an oasis...... The entertainment is great every night something is happening... The free transportation takes you directly to the action and the hotel is located in a quite area so you can actually sleep when you go to bed.

Don't look elsewhere this family and hotel will not disappoint..",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1514,Budget-friendly,40,September 2015,Free shuttle to Seminyak Square was very convenient. Buffet breakfast was pretty enjoyable with a good selection. Very far from everything and some taxis had a hard time looking for the place but location is very peaceful.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1515,Beautiful hotel but average service,30,July 2016,"Stayed here for one night and was really disappointed with the service. Staff were unwilling to help us and would say on multiple occasions that they were sending someone up, but they would never come! Mini bar wasn't cleaned and full of mouldy food. The pool and massage services were the redeeming factors.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1516,Commercial Hotel with all modern facilities,40,July 2016,"If you are going to do lot of touring around Bali and just want hotel to rest your bones and occasional swimming then this is great choice.
It's easily accessible with many modern facilities.

Rooms are sufficiently big with large common swimming pool. Hotel provides best Breakfast options, we had dinner only once in hotel but we had Breakfast as it was included in package. It's unlimited Brekfast with large verity of items.

Rooms are clean and nice. Bed is very very comfortable.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1517,The car park is located across the hotel building,30,December 2015,"The hotel was visited with alot of tourist from overseas rather than local

walking to your room (if your room located at the back of the building) can be confusing to some people

My room was deluxe room, it was spacious, got balcony and at night the lighting in the pool area was a bit dark i said and if your balcony facing swimming pool, you will still be able to hear noise from swimming pool

The breakfast was excellent, so many good food, the staff were friendly

Good hotel, you get what you pay for",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1518,stayed for a week,10,July 2016,"hotel physical building is new and has nice ambience atmosphere. booked Deluxe room in 5th floor. decor and amenities pretty good. the restaurant by the swimming pool however, has a team of inadequate chaotic staff. I ate in the hotel restaurant everyday, and my 1 year old daughter was told she couldn't eat her baby porridge alongside us because its outside food. which seems ridiculous inconsiderate of toddlers. had ordered fried noodles for takeout , took 30 minutes and had to leave for the tour activities, asked the waitress to keep food untill I returned at night. by the time I came back to hotel they apparently threw my takeout ro the garbage. the restaurant staff needs extensive supplement training. hotel very money oriented. could not order outside taxi because they have inhouse taxi which charge double price. Ramada encore essentialy prioritize revenue profit first then customers satisfaction second. they don't really care about customers input advice",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1519,Disappointing,20,July 2016,"Stayed here for 6 nights with two teens, booked two rooms on a package deal through Air Asia online. Our first rooms were right next to the lift and was very noisy early morning so we asked to be moved, which we were the next day. The rooms were called ""deluxe"" but were hardly that. They were spacious enough, but very basic. A small fridge ( no mini bar), kettle, one of each English breakfast tea bag, Earl Grey tea bag, 2 each of coffee sachets, sugar, brown sugar and creamer. Two cups, teaspoons and glasses. The bathroom tiles and grout were stained black and brown and looked dirty. There was dirt under the cabinet that wasn't cleaned the whole time we were there. Bathroom supplies were small bottle each of shampoo, lotion and shower gel (which wasn't replaced after we used it), soap, 2 toothbrushes, shower cap, and cotton buds. The towels smelt musty and were greyish rather than white. There was a bath mat and two hand towels - no face washers. The bottom sheet on our bed in the first room had brown dirt marks on it. The cleaning staff were very inconsiderate by talking in loud voices up and down the hallway at 7am every morning, also pushing the trolleys in the tiled hall was very noisy. They could eliminate this by putting rubber wheels on the trolleys.
The staff at breakfast and counter were very pleasant. The breakfast was good with a large range of options, however the hot food wasn't always hot (or even warm), eggs were cooked fresh to your liking. Nice coffee and cakes, pastries and fresh pancakes/waffles. On two days when we used the pool late afternoon they had no towels, this shouldn't happen.
As I said we had booked a package deal and the rooms didn't have a balcony but a lot of the rooms here have balconies and maybe they are better appointed than what we had. This hotel is located at the end of a street and taxis aren't allowed to pick up along this street so unless you use the hotel transport you will have to walk to a side street and hail a taxi, bearing in mind that this area is not a busy traffic area and you may need to walk to Sunset Road. Our driver advised us not walking this area at night. We have been to Bali 7 times in the last 5 years and this is the worst place we have stayed. Cannot recommend and would not stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1520,Don't believe everything you see...,20,July 2016,"We had been in a bali for a week when we decided to head back to Seminyak for our last 3 nights in Bali. We found this hotel which looked beautiful, pig pool area, basic rooms but that all we wanted so we booked it and the biggest seller of all ""top hotel in 2015"" ha what a joke.

As soon a the door opened to our first room, the smell of mould came straight out and I knew then the room was not clean. First thing I did was rip back the bed cover, found 1 big black hair on the sheets. Touched the side tables and study desk - covered in dust. So I went to reception and calmly asked if the room had even been cleaned and I was told they would send up the cleaners. Whilst waiting for the cleaners to arrive I continued to look at the filth in the room, hair and dirt all over the floor, black marks & blood! yes blood on one of the pillows, marks in the toilet, mould all in the shower I was disgusted! So we demanded to see the manager which they did not want to send up to us. The manager finally arrived who listed to what we had to say before I burst into tears. You get what you pay for but I stayed in cheaper places then this and they have been clean! We wanted a refund but was instead push to another room. We then went to the pool bar to have a drink & calm down, 2 hours later our room was ready. First thing I did was checking the cleanliness and it was pretty obvious they had just been in the room cleaning cause the floor was still damp. It was better and we agreed to stay cause by this stage it was 7pm and we were over it. I still found marks on the sheets, dust, the shower was ok but seriously invest in some bleach for starters, actually clean your room properly and remove teh fake advertising!!!!!!! We will never be back and will not recommend this place to anyone.

Oh and the staff were rude and dirt looking themselves so I guess it sets there standard.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1521,Misleading,20,July 2016,"After seeing the pictures to this 4.5 star hotel, the pictures are very misleading like. We are a family off 4 in one pool room. The pool of the room is lovely but you can't swim till 8am, which coming from gold Coast that is 10am. The air-conditioning is leaving and dripping of rood, toilet does not flush, housekeeping never replace our cups we just don't get any, no spoon to stir the coffee in the cups you don't get. 2 pool towels only given to us and we are 4. Just to many people packed in the lawn budget 3 star hotel. We are here for another week but will not be staying. As to cramped. Our room always messy due to no space! Not very impressed Staff are friend though and food is OK.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1522,"Excellent,",40,July 2016,"Wonderful friendly staff. Most speak good English too. Great buffet breakfast, and well stocked bar. Great pool although they ran out of pool towels several times. They have a spa which offers good prices and great massage. Grout and silicone in our bathroom/shower were mouldy. Free wifi but it wasnt very fast",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1523,Most disappointing part of our Bali holiday,10,July 2016,"If I was Ramada Corporate I would definitely look in to how this particular hotel is being run:

- 15 minutes before we were attended to at check in at reception even though it wasn't particularly busy
- SHEETS IN THE ROOM WERE NOT CHANGED. Stains and hair from the previous customers.
- Pushed to use more expensive hotel taxis which were three times the price of the metered Bluebird taxis.
- Noise noise noise; walls are paper thin, staff are loud and lairy in the morning.
- pretty substandard breakfast buffet, big queues, no coffee etc etc.
- Wifi was not particularly fast or stable.

. . . never again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1524,Excellent hotel,50,July 2016,"We especially appreciated the staff members who were always helpful, nice, kind and patient. Buffet breakfasts were rich enough (scrambled eggs, omelettes, hot dishes, fruit, vegetable, pastry.....) and you can enjoy them by the swimming pool if you like.
Free wifi works without problems.
Even if the location of the hotel (further to the beach) isn´t excellent, you can use everyday free shuttle (at 10, 12, 2pm, 4pm) to Seminyak square or to Kuta beach or book a taxi. The hotel driver can you pick up at the airport and it is even cheaper than if you order a taxi there..
The rooms are well equipped eg. with tea and coffee maker, a large led TV and you get free bottle of water every day.
We were very satisfied there and would come back if came to Bali again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1525,Would come back,40,July 2016,Excellent bar/restaurant staff made the stay worthwhile especially Reynolds. The hotel is situated just outside Seminyak but the taxis are very cheap which isn't too bad. Any problems that were raised were dealt with in professional manner.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1526,Simply awesome!!,50,June 2016,"I would like to start with- ""At end of the day, it feels like you are back at your home""
The staff members weren't treating you in a professional way, but they treat you personally! Loved their Hospitality. Ambiance of the Hotel was pretty good and lively.
Rooms were spacious and clean. Breakfast facility was also good! Negative part of hotel was slightly poor WiFi connection and location of the Hotel but it was satisfying. One day tour/taxi from hotel were bit expensive. Overall our stay was pleasant and had a good experience.

1528,A little off the beaten track...Amazing Staff.,50,July 2016,"I booked this hotel purely for a few nights of R & R following some challenges recovering from surgery. Its quite a new hotel and not all drivers know how to find it yet. I must say, the staff make this hotel great. The smiles and service from reception to breakfast, bar and service staff are something that I wont forget. Dee, the General Manager of the hotel personally assisted me with an issue that arose during my stay (nothing to do with the hotel) and truly went above and beyond the call of duty. Dee, your the best and this clearly extends to the staff under your management who will do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I wont name names of Dee's staff because I'm afraid I'd miss someone out, which really wouldn't be fair. Thanks to the team at Ramada Encore Seminyak. Facilities and Breakfast are great, especially for what you pay, but Bali has always been about the people for me. You are all wonderful. Terima Kasih!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1529,Loved it!,50,July 2016,"Staff were lovely and kind.

A bit busy and not as efficient when needing something, but the staff try their best to accommodate as much as possible.

No problems in our room, although sometimes the aircon cools very slowly. Spacious clean room, although wished the shower room had curtains or a door, so it wont flood the bathroom.

Loved the ambience during dinner!
They had a fire dance at one night. Liked their massage, although the aircon was too cold in the massage room.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1530,"Good place, with some improvements can be better",30,July 2016,Hotel very clean and confortable. Negative insights for the poorest WiFi conection in Bali and the trouble that is book a taxi. They are against uber and grab and push you to book their own taxi service (3x more expensive than the regular). I requested a regular taxi and after 40 minutes the taxi didn't come even though request counters help.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1531,Felt like Faulty Towers!,20,June 2016,"I would NOT recommend staying here. Many let downs. We checked in around 3pm. Our room not ready. Told to go and have our welcome drinks at bar, only you don't get your voucher until you check in. We waited an hour and a half. Room still not ready around 4.30 and I started to get cranky. Finally got our room card at 4.45. Never got our 'welcome drink'. Found our room was not cleaned properly, was actual smear of poo on the outside edge of the toilet. Had to clean myself with my hand sanitiser and toilet paper. Next morning we realised there was a massive stain on the mattress protector. Disgusting. We could see it through the top sheet. We pulled the sheets back so the cleaners could see it and change it. They didn't, just made the bed up again. I phoned the reception and requested it be remade with a clean mattress protector. They never did. At 3.30 one afternoon went to go for a swim. They had run out of beach towels, in fact the whole hotel had run out of all towels. Had to give one of our clean room towels to our friends as theirs had not been refreshed for days. Just found the cleaners to be really slack. Large variety for breakfast but mostly Asian food. Poor range of cereal and fruit. Eggs and toast was basically it, unless you want hot spicy Asian food for breaky or cake. Actually did have waffles which were yum. Glassware always run out for juice. Food and drinks from menu good and well priced. Never used the massage/ spa. Found it to be overpriced. Had a fire dancing show which was good.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1532,"A generic hotel far, far from the city centre",30,June 2016,"This hotel is impossible to find and far, far away from the center of Seminyak.
I only stayed here because I needed a cheap place to stay before my flight.
That said, it's a generic, uninteresting hotel and although the pool is big, breakfasts
were medicore. Although there is a large variety, what was there wasn't that good.
Also, the egg station cook did not know how to fry an egg sunny side up!
There are lots of rules and regulations. You have to get a card for your towels
then return both the towel and room cards before leaving or you'll be charged.
They also charge you for ice! I complained so vigorously, they finally waived the fee, but still, why pay for ice at a 4 star hotel? The room service menu is made up of
a bland choice of pizza, pasta, meats and salads. There's nothing Indonesian on it and the hotel is so far away from everything, that you really have no choice.
Lastly, the wifi went in and out, mostly out.
I would not stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1533,Friendly staff,50,June 2016,"The staff make this hotel, they are very friendly and always have a smile on their face. We asked for an upgrade on arrival as we wanted a room beside the pool, this was arranged for us with no hassle. Very relaxing.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1535,A big busy hotel which lacks character,20,June 2016,"To be fair this isn't the style of place we usually stay in, but it certainly reminded us why! From the very check-in which was slow and for some reason complicated, to the busy Buffett breakfast, to the endless formalities for simply things like getting a pool towel..... This place just wasn't for us.
Perhaps good for a family? The rooms were clean and comfortable and the pool was big. But the design was awful which made getting from just our room to the foyer a 5min walk! It's too far to walk to eat street and the shuttle times are limited. But again, we are more boutique style travellers so perhaps others will have a better experience.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1536,very bad service (not recomended),10,June 2016,"i booked 2 rooms in this hotel with special request to have it side by side, i also call this hotel to make sure we got this room. and some one name brian already confirm it. but at the day we come. recepsionist said there in no more side by side room. im so dissapointed about that. after that they told me that one room still not clean yet. so we have to wait. we came around 18.00pm. and we wait until almost 20.00.. still not clean. im so done with this hotel. so i call the recepsionist and say that i only gave them 30minutes to finish it or i call the manager. over all, im so dissapointed with this hotel. crap service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1537,Family break,40,June 2016,"This is the 3rd time visiting ramada encore seminyak and stayed for 6 nights. Always love the hotel and good value.but this time the service kind of too low. The housekeeping did not clean up the room to clean. Some of the things that should be replace, it did not. The towel is very hard to get new ones especially the pool towel. Other than that we still love the hotel. Just keep attention on that service and customers would be very happy. Thanks",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1538,Great Hotel with reasonable price,40,June 2016,"Stayed for 4 nights. Rooms are OK, but I got the one close by to the elevator and have to bear the tapping noise whenever the elevator operate. Breakfast is great, by the pool side. I REALLY HOPE that the hotel put the area as NON-SMOKING area during the breakfast time as there are lots of kids there and you don't really have a choice where to sit. If you need to go to convenient store, it's quite a distance to walk, but for a small fee you can always use GOJEK (online delivery service, motorbike). Overall, we definitely will come back to this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1539,Great place but poor maintenance,30,June 2016,I wonder how is the housekeeping doing with hairs on the floor from the previous guests. There are some parts in toilet not working properly or missing. It is used to be a very pleasant place but not now. The service is generally acceptable but not fantastic. The sofa in my room isn't as good as before as the cushion has somehow lose it's spring.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1540,great family motel.,50,June 2016,"When you book a holiday not just for yourself but friends as well you only hope that when you get there it is going to be ok, well the hotel did not disappoint and our friends loved it too. From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and very helpful, special mention to Dewa, Dewi and Gita. Our 3 bedroom units were well appointed with everything you needed for a 2 week stay. The food at the resort was good and as you expect more expensive than that in Kuta. We did use the laundry service once, quite expensive then we used a laundry place about 5-10min walk away near the Alpha Mart, would recommend going to him, great rates and service. The Hotel is a bit out of the way but even to get into Kuta is between 40k-50k by Blue Bird Taxi which can be ordered at the front desk or 20-30k to Seminyak square area. You do need to get in early to get the supplied towels for the pool and on a couple of days they ran out. If you like your spirits make sure you brink your 1 litre in from Aust. cause its very expensive other wise Bintang was on the menu for drinks. Over all great Hotel and would certainly recommend for singles thru to families.....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1541,Special time for engagement celebration,50,June 2016,"My son proposed to his girlfriend while staying at the hotel and the Duty Manager Kadek Suarsadana, offered to upgrade their room to a pool view room.

1542,my feedback of the hotel,40,June 2016,"hotel is value for money but certain things coud have been better.

the corridors if carpeted could hv given a better look.
Bathroom floors should be a little more clean.

1543,Average,30,May 2016,"I went to stay there for the second time. Hotel facilities are OK but staff are very unfriendly overall especially female staff.

I wouldn't go there next time",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1544,Amazing staff,50,June 2016,"On 25 May my husband and I checked in and we met Tita for the first time. From that moment she remembered our names and bent over backwards to help us settle in and enjoy our stay. The hotel is fabulous. The accommodation we chose was a dream come true and we loved everything about the Ramada Encore. Five days into our holiday my husband experienced terrible pains at 2am and the hotel staff were so kind and drove us to the hospital. Hubby ended up in hospital for 6 days until we had to Medivac him back to Australia. Throughout that time, once again, the staff were amazing. So caring and passing on good wishes and prayers. I was overwhelmed. Tita then personally arranged to have me driven to the airport so I wouldn't miss my flight. Tita is a most wonderful young woman and we shared lots of stories about each other's lives. I miss her smile and caring eyes.
Tita is a huge asset to the Encore. She knows hospitality inside and out and I need to thank her from the bottom of my heart.
I will return to the Encore one day but in the meantime I will recommend this hotel to anyone I meet and tell them about Tita the duty manager and all the wonderful hotel staff at Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak. Maria Stuart, Adelaide SA",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1546,very good but,40,June 2016,"We have just stayed here for 14 days the hotel was very good value for money, excellent pool,short taxi ride to town, breakfast was good and staff excellent especially Dewi she was very very friendly and helpful. The only disappointing thing was the room service they cleaned the rooms well everyday but never changed the bedding in the whole 14 days and some day you would get towels and toilet paper and others you wouldn't. I would recomend this hotel but would ask that the managment would retrain the cleaning staff on how the do a room clean.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1549,Good hotel,40,June 2016,"This place is a little out of the way so you have to catch a taxi or driver to Seminyak. The driver is about 50000 Rup and taxi 30000rup. A free shuttle is advertised but be aware this only runs about 4 times a day and fills up quickly so reserve a spot the night before.

The Wifi is decent, breakfast is good. They keep the bacon hidden so ask the egg guy if you want some. Service is a little slow.

Apart from the minor negatives the rooms are good, pool is good and price is great. All in all a good hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

We booked honeymoon package and we were surprised how romantically they set up our free candle light dinner in the pool side. staff were really accommodating especially Dewa, the one who fetch us and waited so long at the airport. the food very good. And the ambiance is very relaxing. The only thing they need to anticipate is they must adjust the closing time of their spa, we haven't consumed our free massage because they close very early. But totally, we'll definitely be back here!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1551,You get what you pay for!,10,June 2016,"Stayed at Ramada Encore as friends booked.
Way too inland and you can't walk anywhere ao always cabs.
My room had ants and my request for a quiet room had me on the 3rd floor next to the elevator which would 'bing' every time the doors would open and the hallways echoed.

Staff were friendly. Pool was average. Lounges would sit in ankle deep water not on the ground and 8n the shade so you couldn't really have bags etc with you. The only deck area had 6 beds and one was for the massage lade which was always empty. At 3pm i asked for a towel and they said ""no towel"" so i either go without or he said get one from my room back up to 3rd floor.

If you want a cheap stay this is it.
I prefer closer to the beach.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1552,Good value hotel,40,June 2016,"We spent a week as a family of four (1 parent, 2 teens and a toddler). We arrived at 3am and were fairly quickly shown to our interconnecting rooms. It's a quite large and very pretty hotel. The breakfast buffet is huge and offers lots of variety. The staff here are lovely and by day two everyone knew our toddlers name. However, the location is not ideal. You need a shuttle or taxi to go anywhere. It's impossible to walk with a stroller as there are no footpaths. Secondly, there are no real fridges in the rooms.. Only coolers. Meaning toddlers milk and snacks had to be kept at reception and I had to call down every time we needed something. This was incredibly frustrating. There is no kids playground and be prepared to chase your toddler into the pool constantly. There is a kids room they call kids club it's very small and not staffed. Gym is useable not much equipment. Finally on the last few nights some people moved in to the room next to me and had parties in there. The hotel did ask them to be quiet but it was like staying in a schoolies hotel (they were Indians on Ramadan I think; so awake and shouting all night) so by our second last day I was close to tears of exhaustion but the hotel moved us to another room away from the Indians. Seven nights here was probably a few too many but it is a pleasant enough hotel and the staff make it wonderful. Wifi pretty poor, pool area is lovely. Food is fine.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1553,Perfect hotel for perfect holiday,50,June 2016,"Everything is perfect...the room...the pool and the meal....
i got the deluxe room poolside and its a benefit for us who like enjoy the time in pool area
Its really enjoy the swimming time in the lagoon pool
love this hotel so much...will be back for the next holiday",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1554,"Decent hotel, good continental breakfast, nice service, location not so convenient",30,June 2016,"No issues with the hotel, staff or service. Everything was good. Just that i found the location was not so convenient and traffic around the main road was very high.

Next time may be i would prefer an area close to tourist attractions.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1555,Budget friendly accomidation,40,May 2016,"Me and my husband visited Bali along with 2 other friends and decided to stay in encore ramada. We stayed here for 6 days. Our room was a delux double room with pool view.
The stay was comfortable and the service provided was good. Wide spread breakfast and there is free shuttle service to few places if you want to avail. The pool is neat, staff is friendly and the stay is affordable.There will be live music or a movie streaming during dinner.

As we had a early return flight, we had to checkout early in the morning and the hotel packed some breakfast for us which was very kind. Seminyak is a calm place unlike kuta, which is crowded.

Only concern that we had was the bed we asked for was a double bed instead of which they gave twin beds and joined them. It was manageable tough. The rest of the stay was excellent.

If you are looking for a budget friendly place away from the crowd, land here.

Have a great holiday. :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1556,Value for money with 5star service. special thanks to DARMA!!!,50,June 2016,"This is one of the best hotels that we have come across in Bali. Stayed in one of lagoon access rooms and couldn't ask any thing better. Bit far from Seminyak square (about 2-3km - $3 in taxi) but there is a free shuttle service every 2-3hours. And personally we wouldn't want to live in a busy polluted hotel in middle of Seminyak where relaxing would 0%. We loved this hotel and great service of staff. I have to mention De Darma was beyond best. His genuine gesture and helpful act was a real plus during our stay. This guy is always with a smile... Thank you Darma!!!
The food was amazing and cheap. We hardly had dinner outside. Every night there was some live entertainment in restaurant area!!! Great hotel excellent Service and 5start relaxing environment!!! Will stay again for sure.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1557,Short Stay,30,June 2016,"We stayed 5 nights in the Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak Hotel. Our room was on the 1st level (2nd last room) towards the back of the building as you look at the pool from the hotel dining area. In my opinion, our room was a good location (you wouldn't want a room close to the dining area) as there would be too much noise as there was entertainment most nights. The rooms were comfortable and clean, but the location of the hotel was not near anything. The only mode of transport getting out of the hotel was either a driver being organised by the hotel which cost us 150,000 one way or getting the hotel shuttle bus to set locations. We soon learnt that getting a taxi back to the hotel was only costing between 35,000 and 40,000!!! As we were a group of 5, we settled paying the 150,000 getting out of the hotel, but if you are a couple, it would be best to walk out of the hotel and walk about 5 minutes down the road and hail a taxi. Staff were friendly, but this hotel was a very basic hotel (it didn't even have ""happy hour"") by the pool!! Wi-Fi was a bit slow at times and would drop out. If you are looking for something simple and away from everything - this is where you should stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1558,Friendly and Comfortable,30,June 2016,"My husband and I have just returned from 9 nights stay here. The staff are lovely, beds and pillows great (very comfortable)...room was lovely and being near the pool was great. Unfortunately, the food side of things was a let down. They cater really well for Chinese/Korean guests. Their breakfast offers mostly Asian food. We actually went out for breakfast for the last 4 mornings as there was little to choose from even though the breakfast was included. They Do Not cater for Gluten Free unless previously arranged, and the fresh fruit options were not many. So, eggs, tomato and a little fruit was all I could choose from. We had dinner a couple of times, but found it ok, but not great.
If you want a comfy place to stay away from the noise this place is great, but be prepared to eat out.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1559,A home away from home,50,May 2016,We stayed here recently with our two kids aged 6 and 9 for 9 nights. The family room with balcony was wonderful and above our expectations. Before I arrived I read some of the earlier negative views about this hotel on tripadvisor and was a little worried. But we were pleasantly surprised shortly after we arrived. The pool is lovely and an amazing sight at night time; the evening entertainment is fantastic; the staff are incredibly friendly and housekeeping excellent; the restaurant menu was fine for our needs and the breakfast buffet was lovely. There's no doubt that we've stayed at better resorts but they were 5 stars and a lot more money to stay at. This is an exceptional hotel for the price you pay. It was our first time to Bali so we went out every second day and every other day we just relaxed by the pool and in our room. It was difficult to fault this hotel but one thing I think they could improve on is the check-in experience.... When you've been travelling so long to get to your destination it would be nice to be offered some refreshments on arrival. Overall a wonderful stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1560,Average location,20,June 2016,"Taxi drivers kept telling me this is Denpasar West, and not Seminyak. The hotel it's not in walking distance to anything, and when you ask for a taxi, the staff push (emphasis on the pushiness) the hotel's own car for 100k, yet the trip is only 30-40k. So we would just walk to the highway to get one instead (about a 5 min walk).
The Wi-Fi is beyond a joke, I would recommend purchasing your own SIM card rather than using the hotel's Wi-Fi.
Food menu was very uninteresting. The only menu was the 'all day menu', with a very average selection. And the cocktail menu was not much better.
Lastly, the pool bar is really just a phone to call the main bar - that you are handed to use. I don't believe there are any drinks available from this.

All of this aside, most of the staff are beautiful and friendly. And the pool is great!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1561,Excellent value hotel!!,40,June 2016,"Excellent hotel and friendly, helpful staff!
We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment and the price was brilliant. You do need to catch taxi's to go shopping, ect. But only cost $3-5 per way.
Would highly recommend!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

In this 2nd time here, i directly booked to the hotel and guess what, they upgrade my room into suites ones.
Sure will recommend this hotel and will stay here again if i back to Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1563,Mutton trying to dress up as lamb,30,April 2016,"Very disappointed.. the photos are misleading!! I had booked for 7 nights but after checking in booked to stay somewhere else.. it was terrible. This is an old hotel that they have tired to renovate or modernise but have failed. It is worn out and a coat of paint and some new furniture has not changed it.
- The wifi is so bad I struggled to booked my new hotel from the room had to go to pool area to get a signal.
- Rooms are noisy as the bar in the middle of the hotel has movies or music playing late and the sounds travels. I don't want to wear ear plugs while on holidays
- Air conditioning in the room was non-existent.. changed rooms but it wasn't much better.
- Pool bar service, terrible... I went to pool first thing after breakfast at 8.30 (pool opens 8am) Sorry no towels.... REALLY....
- Lifts smells like toilet air freshener
- Hotel is ripping customers off with non-blue bird taxis that are not metered... .set prices double what you should pay.
- Not enough sun lounges and selfish guests were allowed to reserve with towels at 8.30am...

It cheap but not good value.. plenty of other options in Seminyak with better location, quality and service",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The surrounding area looks like Beirut after a dozen suicide bombers.The T.V is that boring Fox tel crap repeated every day and since you are stuck there it is all there is.Just like their menu.There is nothing to entice you to stay there.We booked out early and moved to another hotel even though it cost us.I recommend avoiding it!,Primera Hotel Seminyak

1575,in the middle of nowhere,10,May 2016,"Hotel very very isolated and too far off main tourist area, miles from shops, restaurants, activities. Shuttle bus takes half hour to seminyak and another half hour to Kuta. Expensive as you either eat in hotel or taxi in and out of seminyak or Kuta. Menu was the same every day, breakfast same every day. Not even a Happy Hour! Felt like we were trapped there. Rooms very small for high price. Hotel had a couple of nights with entertainment and BBQ but meats were already half cooked and it was again very expensive. We left after 3 days and that was the best thing we did. Would NEVER recommend it. Overpriced, isolated with nothing except the staff to recommend it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1576,good value for money,40,May 2016,"the hotel was good, friendly staff, good breakfast buffet. Few downside was the internet, and the towels which are not very clean. And I find the private cars going to Ubud and other places expensive. But overall its good.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1577,Nice stay at Ramada,50,May 2016,"We booked for 4 nights at Ramada encore going by reviews at Agoda and TripAdvisor. Hotel is really worth the money you pay with amazing pool to relax. We had booked Deluxe Pool View room which was very clean with very comfortable bed. The breakfast spread was good and lot of options to try, but got bored of it as menu was repetitive. We also dined at restaurant, we tried local delicacies which was prepared well but slightly on oily side and expensive compared to restaurants nearby. We also went for spa treatment and are happy with the services provided. Only in one of the evening house keeping staff didnt turned up despited repeated calls which slightly marred our excellent experience. Cons - If you are bringing food in a room, ants will pounce immediately (within 5 min).",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Being our first visit to Bali we had airport transfers organised by the hotel and had a lovely man greet us called wayan and he was just amazing such a honest and safe driver couldn't have asked for anyone better to be waiting for us with a great smile as we landed

Our room also included in a beautiful buffet breakfast every morning (waffles are amazing)

1581,Fabulous!,50,May 2016,"Great hotel with all the facilities. Breakfast has amorous variety of food from a buffet. The rooms are lovely and clean and the beds big and comfortable. Staff are very helpful. The only downside is the noise from the pool area. If you like your sleep, as I do, the music will continue until 10.00 otherwise very suitable for couples and families old and young. The hotel is. Little bit outside of seminyak but only three dollars aus in a taxi. I would very much recommend this hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1582,"great location, friendly staff",40,May 2016,"We stayed for 7 nights. Great location, lovely staff, breakfast was great but restaurant selection was limited. Great swimming pool and we were allowed to swim after 8pm rule so that was great. Room was spacious and clean but housekeeping kept forgetting to replenish tea and coffee - not a biggie.

Reception, housekeeping and front door staff were excellent with arranging cars and general info.

All in all, a very enjoyable stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1583,LOOOOOTS OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT,30,May 2016,"LOTSSSSSSS OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.
Let me begin by saying, my decision to choose this hotel was based on your Website Pictures in AGODA and rating. We booked 5 rooms for 3 night. I thought Good Value for Money. As our stay took place, our impression of the Hotel dropped as everyday passed.
Before I list everything that went wrong, I will say that the pictures posted truly represented what was captured in the pictures on the website. What need to be IMPROVED is House Keeping and Customer Service.
Room Number 4231: Needs to be truly highlighted as they had the worst experience . Whoever was assigned as Housekeeping for this room should be FIRED.
1. Sheets were not fresh when we checked in. Stains were visible but since we checked in so late, the guest lived with it. The next morning they asked the Front Desk to make sure the sheets were changed, upon return again late at night, it was not. They called house keeping to change sheets at midnight.
2. First night NO CUPS, WATER BOTTLES and Coffee setting.
3. On the 2nd night, guest discovered that USED cups in the room were simply turned over and not replaced. GROSS

Room 4247:
1. Floors were never mopped or swept, footprints the day before were visible the next day especially near the windows.
2. Our Air conditioner would not switch on as we slide the key in the slot. Every night we had to call Maintenance. Lucky they came quickly. Finally they gave us a spare card to leave in the key slot.
3. Towels did not look white/clean anymore. It is about time you change them.
4. Housekeeping clearly do not wipe down sinks and glass because watermarks are very visible.
Room 4233, 4241, 4231, 4237 : Poor WIFI signal
Breakfast and Pool Bar Service
1. Kudos for checking Hotel Room Numbers and escorting us to our table for breakfast but all service ends there. A friend of mine, asked if there was ketchup and the waiter simply said “ over there”. Could he have not offered to help get some. I know if was a Buffet but a little touch of service could not hut.
2. On our second day, another guest with kids took our assigned table. Not wanting to create a fuss, we took another table. The hostess insisted we move because it was missing one chair. We informed her that someone took our table and if she cares so much about seating arrangements, why does she not move that family. In our minds she simply did not want to get us another chair. We took another chair for another table and the hostess left us alone.
3. Why does bacon have to special ordered? Plus there was no sign telling guest, we had to do that. We had to ask other guest how they got bacon.
4. On our 3nd night, a couple of us decided to sit by the pool and have a couple of drinks. 2 waiters passed and we asked if we could order some drink. Both informed us that the Pool bar was closed but we could cash and carry from the bar. Is it really that hard to bring us a menu and serve us some drinks? We did go to the bar and after buying 4 bottles of beer and 3 Smirnoff cans , no one offered to help us carry all the drinks. I give KUDOS to the Smirnoff Promo Girl for offering to help us bring the drinks to our table.
SPA
The Hotel did a very good job promoting the SPA. Prices we felt were reasonable. However when you get to the SPA, you get disappointed 1. Because of poor signage.We passed the room twice until a head popped out from the room, and 2. because it was a simple room. How much does a can of paint cost and a couple of painting?. We rearranged our schedules to fit the spa in and regretted missing Water Sports.
SUGGESTIONS
It would be nice when booking Rooms if you added descriptions on the view of the room. Garden View or Pool View?. It would also help if you indicate with or without balcony. We would have been wiling to pay extra to get Rooms with Balcony but I did not see it as part of my room choices.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1584,Average,30,May 2016,"It is what I expected for the price. If you look at it for what it is a cheap hotel then it is good.

Pros
- the pool is nice and big
- sun chairs in the water are nice and there is lots of shade at all different times of the day
- location isn't too bad $3 AUD taxi into Seminyak or $5 for a private driver organised through the hotel.
- friendly staff
- hotel clears out of guests after breakfast so not very busy which is good for relaxing by the pool
- bed was large and the pillows comfy
- we got a free room upgrade to pool access room which was great

Cons
- breakfast was terrible we only went 1 morning out of 3
- sheets are cheap and bit itchy not overly though
- staff cleaned our room and took all towels but didn't leave any clean ones, didn't find out till I was in the shower
-towels weren't white anymore they were marked and had a grey wash appearance to them
- staff didn't have good knowledge of areas they didn't work in and would generally just answer with ""I'm not sure""
- check in at 2pm we got to the hotel after 2pm our room wasn't ready, we had to wait 45 minutes
- when we checked in they didn't advise us we would need to put down a deposit to charge things to our room, they didn't give us a token to get pool towels and they didn't give us the wifi password

Over all the cons weren't enough to ruin our stay, we stayed at much nicer places during our trip so I think we had higher standards by the time we stayed here.

Overall if you are looking for a nice cheap place to stay with a comfy bed and nice pool then I would recommend this hotel. Wasn't amazing but it is a $50 a night hotel so you get what you pay for.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1585,Nice but far,40,April 2016,"Upon entering the Ramada, my partner and I were greeted with a very warm welcome from the staff members. We were early with our check in so we sat by the amazing pool and ordered a few drinks.

Once we could check in, we made our way to our room. At the time the hallway was very dimly lit which remained for most of our stay. The room was nice and spacious, although the bathroom is quite small. We did have ants in our bathroom and on our table where the kettle was, which was annoying. However, the bed is by far the comfiest bed I have ever slept in, with a great mattress and pillows.

The location is 5-10 minute drive from Seminyak square and taxis can only drop you off to your hotel, they cannot pick you up. We hired a scooter to make our lives easier instead of waiting for the shuttle each time, which I think had picks up every hour.

The breakfast was absolutely delicious and both western and Indonesian cuisines were served to cater for everyone. The pool is definitely the best part of the hotel and sets a very romantic scene and mood at night, especially if you have the romantic candlelit dinner.

A good experience in all but would most likely stay closer to Seminyak square next time I visit Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1586,2 week visit,40,May 2016,"Great staff, very attentive, location is a bit far out, have to get a taxi to go anywhere. Nice facilities and the breakfasts are great, the restaurant staff are the friendliest of the lot. On the site we booked it advertises free shuttle to multiple locations however only actually takes you to 1. It is only available at 10, 12 and 5 and takes you to seminyak square which is not good for shopping at all. Other than that they offer their driver service at double the price of a taxi.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1587,No good if you don't like noisy hotels!,20,May 2016,"The Ramada Encore is a nice hotel in the quiet area of Seminyak and it's very cheap! The pool is great and the buffet breakfast is very enjoyable. The staff are excellent and were so nice to my little boy who is only 1. They have food pool suitable for kids and a playroom. We hired a baby sitter a couple of times that the hotel recommended and she was fantastic!!

However there's a couple of annoying things that could have easily made my review 4. stars rather than 3 and they are little things that bugged me personally.

Firstly the music that is played in the foyer and the restaurant area is not appropriate for a hotel. I felt like I was in a nightclub in Kuta! Honestly it just gave me a headache after a while and it's not relaxing at all when you're lying by the pool or taking a swim. Some laid back background music would have been adequate or even some traditional music.
This brings me to the second issue....
We're traveling as a family and having a son that is only a 1 year old we were naturally in bed by 9:30 at night. Now, I'm all for the hotel putting on entertainment but I know there are a lot of families who stay here and I'm sure they feel the same way but the music or bands they have are way too loud and are on later than I would like. We stayed in a room at the other end of the pool and it sounds like the music is in the room with us. On our last night (which is the night I'm typing this review) I'm lying in bed early at 8:30 as we have to be up at 4am to get to the airport and again there is excessively loud music playing. Like I said I understand the hotel are trying to put on entertainment for their guests but when you're trying to sleep (especially with a young child) it's not making my stay here enjoyable, not only that it's every night and you just get sick of it. I've stayed in more peaceful hotels and this sounded and looked peaceful. Turns out it is not.
Lastly there were a few times when we went to the pool and they had run out of towels. Doesn't sound like a big deal but you can't use your room towels as they don't allow it plus they wouldn't dry before you needed a shower. Even though it's hot in Bali in the afternoon it's very shady in the pool area so you can't just drip dry. Luckily one of my other family members who spent most of their time at the pool had a towel with them so we could at least dry our son. Very poor to run out of towels so often.

So it's now 9pm and I've decided to drop this review to 2 stars because now they're blasting out dance music!!!!! I wonder how long it will go on for and if we will get any sleep tonight.
Turns out this part of Seminyak is not so peaceful. Bring ear plugs or if you like raving and you can't be bothered going to a nightclub in Kuta then this is the hotel for you!

For our next family trip I will not be coming back.... I enjoy my sleep too much.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1588,I didn't want to leave,50,May 2016,"Stay at this place, from the moment you arrive they make you feel welcomed.

It's comfortable and it's so exciting especially the pool and gym. we will stay again.

The breakfast is good , the shuttle bus is complimentary and the customer service ast reception is friendly. I think overall it's really really fallouts.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1589,Poor hotel management,20,May 2016,"We stayed for 2 nights and our first expression of this hotel was bad. We found blood stain on our bed sheet and dirty floors when we just walked in to our room. Then we discovered that the kettle in our room was broken and we had to wait for almost an hour for housekeeping to come and fix the kettle.
The good side of this hotel has big swimming pool and kids club which our daughter loves to play and spend time there.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1590,9nights/10days,40,May 2016,"Firstly there was a hiccup with my booking which resulted in an extra x2 days being charged to my card as a no show fee, which was cancelled & refunded after I went down & spoke to front desk which was great but it also took x3 days for funds to clear back into my acc.

Room at first smelt a little musty which obviously was easily removed with a few sprays but being everywhere else in the hotel has an overwhelming smell of air freshener its kinda hard not to think why couldn't this be added to rooms.

The towels that are replaced daily by the cleaners are great, but I felt they also had a unpleasant smell to them.

Transport - they persuade you to use their cars which by all means is ok but it's set prices and I found Taxi's to be a cheaper option. We ended up hiring a scooter which cost us $6 a day & $5 petrol the entire stay exploring the island going down all the little side streets, stopping at road side stalls etc it was great.

Other then that everything else was amazing... Staff is amazing - all very helpful & full of smiles.

Bed was comfortable especially the pillows!!!!! I miss them big fluffy soft pillows. Aircon worked a treat, shower was nice and hot. Pool big & clean.

Location for us was great. I like it a little quiet and away from the hustle and taxi beeps every 5secs lol. But close enough to get to with a quick taxi ride or even better jump on one of the free shuttles. In our case with the scooter it was a short ride into Seminyak for us. We even took the hotel push bikes (at no cost) for a spin to the closest Alfa-mart to get some supplies which was great.

We also had a valuable item (white beats earphones) misplaced/taken/stolen/lost whilst here. At no stage at all am I pointing fingers or accusing anyone as we honestly don't know where or what happened to it but it definitely left our possession at the hotel which was the biggest bummer.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that's considering it.
For the price you pay it is worth it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1591,Beautiful new hotel but will try somewhere else next time,30,May 2016,"PROS: excellent, friendly staff *great variety breakfast (even coffee machine) *well laid out hotel *pool kept immaculate *constant bleaching of linen not done - I think this is great for the environment (ocean leaching!), whilst you can feel the linen is still clean. *great bathroom kit that's replenished if used - very unexpected *great massage.
CONS: Not all hotel fault but for buyer beware: * Wifi atrocious until Sunday when a heap of guests left & no longer sending a million selfies home. We just wanted to do some simple online banking but couldn't! * See the pic with smaller oval pool? That's where the kids & adults who cant swim but take selfies hang out. We had pool access room there but due to construction over head we requested be moved on day 3. Moved up the back of hotel (lagoon?). See pic with 2 red beanbags. That 1/2 of hotel after the bridge is quieter. Tho it's every man for himself to get a bed, even taking it from outside rooms - doesn't automatically come with their room so don't be shy to move it I say! *laundry lost between room moves, even tho twice reminded staff. After 2 days absent spent a couple hours chasing it. *new room had an odour about it - perhaps musty old smoke smell. Aircon left on helped. Was only 2 more days.. *yes transport isn't as great as being on a main street. 50,000 for 4 min ride or right to beach - no bartering. Transport hut is 1/2 way to main road & they monopolise surrounding hotels. Not the biggest deal but when getting a fare 13,000 home (we tip to 20) you feel ripped off until you realise it's only a few bucks & it balances out with the longer trips. Day 3 we asked hotel to order Bluebird as going to Discovery Mall and paid enough fixed prices with transport guys - was done with no issue, & quickly. *For the hotel: we're happy to use towels a couple of times, if it's to keep staff in jobs/busy, please dedicate more time to cleaning the bathrooms as they're getting shabby already in this beautiful new hotel.
**As at 2 May there's renos 3rd floor of the south east side. Might not bother earlier risers as much as me who likes to sleep til 8 or 9 on holiday.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1592,Great with the family,50,May 2016,Excellent value for the family. Had the 3 bedroom suite which easily took 4 adults and 3 children. Good breakfast and I would say tastier than some of the 5 star resorts I've been to. A little further away from the action but still an excellent hotel!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1593,"Unbelievable, you won't regret staying here!",50,April 2016,"We moved to the Ramada after a terrible stay elsewhere, and were just blown away. The staff go out of their way to accommodate you. The rooms are fine, the pool is unreal and the food quality is superb.

There is always entertainment happening each night at the hotel restaurant, from fire dancing to movie night. It's 100% family friendly as well as balancing that with quiet time for couples and friends on holiday together.

Would go back in a heartbeat! And don't worry about the short distance to Seminyak Square because they have a complimentary shuttle twice a day :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1594,"Good hotel, great pool",40,May 2016,"Loved our stay here. Pool was beautiful, room was clean and breakfast was great each day. Location was nice and quiet and staff were very friendly.
Only thing we didn't like was the taxi service as they tried to rip us off. You can however hire a scooter from the hotel and they worked out to be a lot cheaper than taxis.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1595,Great experience,50,May 2016,"I have visited many hotels and found ramada encore Bali Seminyak to be one of the best I have visited.Thumbs up to Tita and her team for doing their best in making our stay very comfortable.

Some good points as below
-
Hotel reasonably priced.
Staff is very accommodating.
Rooms are modern and clean.
Ambience is great.
Location is quiet and quiete central.
Poolside setup is great. The

Some points that need to be worked on
-
Food is 5/10 and the breakfast menu should have more variety on a daily basis.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and I will be staying at this hotel the next time Iam in Bali.

Overall
8/10.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1596,Beautiful hotel in Seminyak,50,May 2016,"We had a wonderful 12 days in this fantastic hotel .....yes it's a bit out of the way but for us this was a bonus as it was so quiet with no street noise at all and they have a frequent shuttle service to Seminyak and twice a day service to Kuta and the local transport and taxi's are cheap. We upgraded to a lagoon room and it was well worth the extra money we were in room 1318 which was at the far end of the pool which was just perfect, the whole place is spotlessly clean, the staff are all friendly and helpful and the food in the restaurant is great and cheap, most nights there is entertainment in the restaurant/bar area which is an added bonus. There is also an onsite spa which I found great and you can organise tours etc through reception if you need to. This was our first stay at the Encore but would definitely go back and would recommend it to anyone wanting a reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, friendly hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the busier areas of Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1597,"3 Star European, many ""little"" issues",30,April 2016,"This extract of feedback to the management will provide you will the positives and negatives that I encountered..

Staff - generally pleasant and willing. Few occasions that they could not think outside of the box. Restaurant when I had passed my ""500,000INR blocked money limit"" the staff were annoying - making me feel like I’d caused a problem. The letter I received to inform me I'd exceeded the limit was very indirect and ""information"", not a demand to pay, hence I was prepared to pay on the day of leaving the hotel. Then later in the evening, your staff chasing it up by calling my room - no need for this (except the info letter) to have happened.

Room - Bathroom not clean when we first arrived. Drain in shower was blocked and so the shower area flooded over onto the main bathroom floor within 3-5 minutes of the shower water running, and there was lots of mould on the tiles. After requesting for the shower area to be deep cleaned, it was cleaned to near that standard that we expected.
The mirror and sink area were not cleaned very well. I think this is ultimately about cleaning processes and likely that the cleaners have not been taught to do this properly - these were nice guys, but perhaps lacked the proper processes and techniques taught to them from management.

The bed - I like large pillows but those pillows were far too large and very heavy. Both the pillows and the quilt were polyester and of cheap quality. I woke up sweating a few times because of this.

Aircon - it didn’t always function properly and so was very frustrating.. we had to keep it on at 16 degrees all week, but sometimes it wasn’t even operating at 16 degrees.. It was also loud and hence I used ear plugs to sleep every night.. I've since been staying in other hotels this week, none of which have a ""loud aircon"" problem - your systems are just cheap and old-fashioned.

Swimming pool - water was cloudy, and I'm convinced that it wasn't clean. My brother works with swimming pools in the UK, hence I understand the requirements. I appreciate that your health and safety standards are not to the same level, however, you should have signs up showing the most recent water quality test results, and the water quality should be considered more - removing leaves is only part of the solution.
Swimming hours should be enforced - too many Chinese ignore the rules. Signs should be put up in Chinese too. It annoys everyone else to see Chinese people doing what they want..

Gym - Cardio machines were new, but a cheap brand - they don’t operate as efficiently as better quality machines. The seat on the exercise bike is broken too - the metal from the seat locking lever has worn already - cheap soft metal from China and hence it didn't secure the seat so the seat moved around when I was cycling. Also the levels of effort that the exercise bike generated were not accurate - there was problem between the computer programme of selected effort level and the actual energy level I had to use to turn the pedals…

Breakfast - generally ok given the cost. I’d say most products were cooked in a poor quality oil, especially the eggs, and any chicken dishes - which was a bit off-putting. Would have been nice to have a better selection of healthier foods.

Lunch/ Dinner food - Club sandwich was not very good at all. There was only a little chicken in the sandwich, the lettuce was wet, which made the toast at the bottom of the sandwich soggy and wet, and the toast was not properly toasted either. The food and drinks were also overpriced.

21% service charge - ridiculous - really not happy with this. You already had charged extra for room service meals and you charge an extra 21% on top. Many restaurants add on 5%, and I think 5-10% is fair.. but 21% is just rude, especially when I’d imagine the money does not go directly to the staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1598,"Ok Hotel, but very good for the price!",30,May 2016,"Stayed in Sep last year and just again in May this year. Some staff are very friendly, the pool is amazing for adults. A little far out but can get taxi for 40k ($4AUD). Rooms were very slow to be cleaned daily. Food and drinks are quite reasonably price for nice food. Breakfast was ok.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1599,Perfect relaxing stay,50,May 2016,"Very nice, smiley and polite staff all day, great pool, comfortable room!
Once we had a candle lighted dinner by the pool, it was so romantic. We played also with the billiard and table soccer (we had good fun), breakfast & food are fresh and there is a wide choice in the morning. The coffee was good, and there are fresh fruits as well. I recommend this hotel for sure if you want a nice, peaceful & relaxing stay in a nice hotel! :) good job!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1600,Great Hotel and friendly staff!!,50,May 2016,"Staff very friendly and breakfast was awesome fresh and delicious, we spend time at the pool it's very comfortable, we love the sun bed also, room very clean and they give us swan towel thank you reservation team Ms. Chintia and Arsha to complete our special request and give us perfect room with nice view, we will come back!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1601,Horrible... Never will return to Bali,10,February 2016,"Am extremely upset! We stayed for over 2 weeks and had another week booked but had to fly home due to an emergency and so disappointed with everything.

Staff were rude, pool was shocked everyday with chlorine instead of cleaned properly, pillows were horrible, extremely overpriced food, the fact that you have to either put down 1mill in an account or pay cash instead of being able to pay at the end (for room service etc) is extremely frustrating and on top of that, they ring and abuse you if you happen to go over and demand they get their money and will even come to the room! Even after being told that you will go down in an hour after your shower... They then refuse to take responsibility for any of it. Also, staff do not come back with change - you get tipped for good service, not just because you take the money! The fridges in the rooms aren't cold and it's apparently because they are just ""coolers"" and aren't meant to be cold. So your told to deal with it. Also if you wanna go out and buy some drinks for your fridge because there aren't mini bars, good luck because the staff will follow you and ask a million questions that make you feel as if you've stolen something or done a horrible crime!

We had to leave early to come home and it's been a month and we are STILL waiting for our refund! I've emailed twice and no response for the second email chasing it up.... This is a joke. It does not take a month to get a refund... And they delete their bad reviews on fb so don't trust everything on here because who knows if it is actual people who stayed there and not them!

I can't actually fathom that people think this hotel is good- you want good 4-5 star, stay at the Chatrium Riverside in Bangkok. They at least know how service should be given and actually make you feel like they care!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1602,Average stay.,30,April 2016,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Staff was friendly and service is good, but the shower area in the toilet had stains and the bed sheets had some stains. For a new hotel I expected things to be in a better condition, there is still room for improvement. Walls are thin so it was a bit noisy. Other than, it was a comfortable stay. So if you are going to be out most of the time and use your room for sleep, this place is fine.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1603,EXCELLENT for a reason!!,50,April 2016,"The Ramada Resort is absolutely amazing! Service is impeccable and so wonderfully friendly! Never an issue and everything is always well managed. Layout of the place is PERFECT. The rooms are extremely spacious, well maintained, modern and very clean. Toiletries are also stocked daily. If you're debating which room to pick, opt for the pool view! Very pleasant and you'll always be part of the hotel events. Plus, if you've got kiddies, always a great way to keep an eye on them. The restaurant is GREAT! Lots of options! Plus, 2 or 1 59K cocktails! Their buffet breakfast is also fantastic. Lots of variety ranging from standard western breakfast - asian - Italian. So, if pasta is what you want for Breaky, then pasta is what you'll have! At night the hotel offers different themed events. Whether it be a movie night or satay night, you name it, they'll have something on for your nights. Massages are FANTASTIC. $25aus for a stone massage. Do I need to say anything more? Now, although the location is a little out of the 'main area' and not much around, the hotel offers a FREE shuttle buses to both Seminyak and Kuta *see! amazing!* Then, there's the POOL ~ one of the best, lots of sun, lots of sun lounges, always being cleaned. Perfect. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to FAMILIES, GROUPS and SOLOs. Fantastic hotel for the cost of the stay. (Oh! and their pillows and beds are SUPER COMFY!!)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1604,"Friendly Staff, great service & stay!",50,April 2016,The Staff at Ramada were the best experience about this resort. Everyone was super friendly and always went out of their way to assist us. My partner fell of his bike during our stay here and the staff went out of there way to find everything that we needed to make his stay more comfortable. The breakfast buffet was to die for and the resort itself was relaxing and beautiful. We had the lagoon access room and you walked right out into the outdoor lagoon. This was definitely a bonus and made our stay just that extra bit special. I would recommend the Ramada to anyone and hope to go back there soon!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1605,A peaceful stay!,30,April 2016,"For the last half of our holiday we stayed at Ramada Encore in Seminyak, after our sleepless experience at Swiss-belhotel Tuban, this location was a welcome reprieve. The rooms were not as up-market and deluxe as Swiss-belhotel Tuban, but they were clean and quiet in comparison. The patrons were better behaved and the resort was much more family oriented, the food was decent, much like the Swiss-belhotel in Tuban and overall more accommodating to Westerners offering more variety of Eastern and Western cuisine.
The first few times we used the pool it wasn't very clean and the guy in charge of the pool towels was a bit of a stickler for rules, even though we were told by the front desk that we could borrow 3 towels for the pool, the staff in charge of the towels refused to give us 3 on the basis that our daughter was small and therefore didn't need her own towel. The same rule of thumb was applied when house cleaning tidied our room and I had to consistently ask for additional towels, which was irritating to say the least. Another irritation was that when we arrived our rooms weren't ready and we had to wait in the lobby for about an hour. My last complaint was that although we asked for non-smoking rooms my in-laws room was situated near the stairwell and everytime someone went our to the stairwell to smoke, their room would fill up with cigarette smoke via the air conditioning. This was a major downside considering my father-in-law has asthma and a chronic lung condition. Aside from those few things our stay was decent. Although I personally wouldn't stay here again (as it didn't cater to our needs very well), many other people have had a wonderful experience here. If I were to change a few things regarding our stay I would opt for a pool side room and one more family friendly as it was too small in a double room for the three of us and a provided travel cot (which isn't ideal for a 3yr old), and ask for less sugary food and drink, which unfortunately is more of a cultural thing than anything else.
One person in particular, which I would like to acknowledge is Tita, she made my daughters stay a real delight (thank you Tita). She was so attentive and accommodating and was a real delight to deal with. She made us feel secure and relaxed. The majority of the staff were really friendly and helpful, and the free shuttle bus service was great to get around to Kuta and Seminyak.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1606,Out of the way,30,April 2016,"We stayed here for a week and the hotel was nice but the bathroom was very small. Upon arriving after 2 pm when we were supposed to check into our rooms, our rooms were not ready and after waiting for an hour I asked when our rooms would be ready and they said they didn't know so after waiting some time more we eventually went out for a while.
Pool, the water was very smokey and when we asked for 3 towels for 3 people we were told we were only allowed 2 per room! I have never heard of anything like it. The food on the menu was OK the breakfast was average. The hotel is situated miles from anything so if that doesn't bother you then that's fine. Our stay was average but the staff were very good. I would not stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1607,Girls week away,40,April 2016,"My first impression was good upon arriving at the hotel, the reception staff were very helpful, we were 2 hours early for our check in but they sent us to the bar for a complimentary drink while our room was getting ready. We were able to get to our room within 15 min. Our pool access room was clean, comfortable & functional did have a slight musty smell but passed after aircon had been on for a little while. Breakfast was good. Restaurant also good.
All up a good mid range priced hotel",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1608,Expectations were too high,30,April 2016,"I feel my stay wasn't anything special. The hotel was beautiful, great pool area, rooms were nice with a universal plug in the wall was nice after backpacking around. Although there were a lot of kids splashing around making the pool hard to enjoy. The chairs weren't comfy and half the time there was no towel person around to get towels. With. Rating as high as it is I was expecting a little more. But could have been worse",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1609,Nice staff...a real bonus.,40,April 2016,"Nice friendly and helpful staff...had a couple of small hiccups...room still not ready at 3pm so we had to wait 30 mins. We specifically stressed non smoking room as my husband has a lung condition and they put us in a room almost next to the outside smoking stairwell (!!!??) Consequently our Aircon unit would bring in the stale smoke from outside. Not happy!
On first entry our bathroom smelt strong of stale urine, we asked twice to have it cleaned, which after the 2nd time it was better. Pool towel situation was unusual...only 2 towels.per room with a plastic card exchange even though our family had a daughter she had to use mummy and daddy's towel. I agree with earlier comments about it being out of the way but the shuttle service to seminyak is every hour and to kuta is 10 am and 5pm but you must find your own way back. The pool in the children's area was a little slimy on the bottom and the water a bit murky but was nice and quiet away from the kids section. In summary, the staff are a real assett to this establishment...would I stay again? Maybe not.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1610,Quiet with nothing around,40,April 2016,"This hotel is very far away from Seminyak Square and anywhere so be sure you are prepared to pay for transportation. Nothing is closed by: the closest Alfa Mart is at least 15 mins walk. The hotel is situation at the end of the road with other villas and vacant land so it is very quiet.

Room is tidy and clean - shower can do with a good scrub to get the mould out. Shower head needs a good vinegar clean. Modern shower design with a glass partition and no shower curtain. Water goes everywhere whenever you take a shower even though you stand at the corner furthest away. Fridge is not cold at all whether you put 1 can in or 10 cans in. Wifi is sufficient but can be improved. Aircon is not too noisy but temperature dial doesn't work properly so it gets really cold which helped the humid and hot weather. Bed is big but not very long, I'm 5'4 and my legs are nearly at the edge of the bed so tall people be aware.

Shuttle bus service runs from 10am and every 2 hours to Seminyak and twice to Kuta. Drop off no pick up. You have to book to make sure you can get on the bus. I would recommend to increase shuttle buses due to the distance from anywhere. This will keep your customers happier.

Receptionist host manager Tita was very helpful during our stay. She gave us good advice of the best way to visit the Ayana Hotel to visit the Rock bar, and organised a car for us promptly. It's important for the host manager to remember guests and Tita has certainly done a good job. All staff were friendly and helpful especially the restaurant staff. Thank you! Lovely food from breakfast til dinner! We love it!

One thing I noticed the bar can only provide certain cocktails on the menu and others run out. It would be good to know at first what is available to avoid having to decide and being told it's not available after 10 mins being there.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1611,Hotel police....,30,April 2016,"This place was average in food average in room, everything was very average. Get this they have 'police' they would not allow us 3 towels for 3 people. Not allowed to play on the fooseball table until 11am. Like seriously. The food was tasteless and average. The staff was great at least, always polite and nice for the most part. Room is dark and average looking. Needs attention or renovating. The pillows were terrible and flat. I don't think I would come back...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1612,Value for money,40,April 2016,"Pros
How amazing the pool is and very clean, great idea about the deck chairs being partially in the pool.
Complimentary welcome drinks quite nice.
Sun was out from 9am til 3pm as the pool is inclosed by the hotel walls, so the sun disappears over the hotel walls after 3pm.
Air con worked a treat..so good!
Hotel was a little out of the way 30 minute walk/ 7 min drive to Seminyak square bit annoying having no mini mart near hotel to get water and so on, but they made up with it by the free shuttle bus service going to Kuta/ Seminyak square at 10am and 5pm daily.
Beautiful big bed got lost in it and large room.
Big shower (although the water smelt like sewage but I Spose you get that anywhere in Bali).
Toilet was of European standard so it actually flushed, not like normal Asian toilets which get blocked at the slightest thing.
We got the balcony overlooking the pool defiantly worth the extra money, beautiful view of pool and nice to sit out on balcony during the hot days.
How amazing the pillows are!!
Buffet breakfast average hotel standard, Good selection of breads, I would have liked to see more fresh fruit though, was good to see all the staff using tongs to place the food out.
Staff very friendly
They also had a security check set up before entering the hotel which was fantastic to see.
Check in and check out was quick and easy.

Cons
Calling our room at times to invite us to dinner was a bit annoying as we just wanted to relax.
Fridge not being cold.
Stayed in room 3313. They had bit of a Wasp issue outside our room and we had to duck and weave as to avoid the wasps, I asked a staff member for some bug spray and he obliged to do it but they were still there the next time we went out.
Room Service was terrible food I ordered the pesto pasta and the pasta was overcooked and soft, I also specifically asked for the temperature to be piping hot and it came cold.
Wifi mediocre (although doesn't work in peak times like 8pm as everyone is on it).

Overall we paid $600 Aus for 9 nights and for that price it's defiantly worth it. Value for money

Improvements they could make;
Fridges that actually get cold
More fruit at breakfast buffet
Better pest control!
Room service meals to be of better quality.
Wifi extenders in rooms",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1613,Amazing,50,April 2016,"Highly recommend this hotel.

Ideal Family Holiday",50,April 2016,"We stayed 8 nights at the Ramada Encore in Seminyak & I can honestly say we will be back! The Staff there are Amazing, They feel like our family always taking the time to make our kids smile with countless amounts of Hi Fives & cuddles whenever we passed them by even if they were busy!! I can not compliment them enough (we have made friends for life here!) They feel like our family, The service & the cleanliness of this Hotel is 5 Star, The location was perfect, and the Bed is so comfortable it made us feel like we were at home, The pillows are HUGE, the Pool is magnificent, we enjoyed watching them clean it every morning, The buffet breakfast was delicious it is a mix between traditional Indonesian food, Bacon & Eggs (cooked however you desire!) Fruit platters and pastries & every type of bread you could imagine ! The nightly entertainment was awesome, they also offer a free shuttle everyday to take you into Kuta square & Seminyak and a taxi back from either location (bluebird only!) costs no more then $5 Australian (50000 Rupiah) I cant compliment the staff enough YOU are A Credit to the Ramada we cant wait to visit you all again <3",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1615,Home away from home Highly Recommend,50,April 2016,"We travelled here with our 2 kids and stayed at the ramada encore for 8 days, and we absolutely loved it the pool was amazing and massive they cleaned it every morning the place was spotless the beds are so comfortable best sleep Ive had in awhile, breakfast every morning was the best very tasty and alot to choose from the buffet, but the Staff is what makes this place, some of the most beautiful people you will ever meet we have made friends there for life, they would take the time even if they where busy to hi five our kids and talk and play to get a smile out of our kids they were like our family away from home always helpful and willing to go out of there way for us, we will be staying here evey time we are in Bali it's our home away from home, I highly recommend the ramada encore love love love this place and there staff can't thank you enough.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1616,Relaxing stay with a beauitful pool,50,January 2016,We stayed here for 5 nights last minute when our accommodation fell through and it was the best thing that could of happened. The room was spacious and clean with comfortable beds and the bathrooms were a little dated but roomy. The staff were polite and accommodating and our stay came with buffet breakfast which had an incredibly good spread which changed daily. The pool is beautiful and a great size for the hotel. Location wise its off the main street and main areas but like everything it's only a short taxi away and means the pace is a lot more relaxed. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1617,Great stay at ramada thanks to staff member Tita especially,50,April 2016,"Thanks especially to wonderfull Tita for making our stay fantastic, she went out of her way to make us feel at home and is a great asset to this hotel.She helped us with all our requests and needs and even helped us with our toddlers needs..great job..thanks to all other staff aswell .Sandy and damian and family",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1618,Staff here are wonderful and make all the difference,40,April 2016,"I recently spent 10 days with a group of adults at this hotel. The staff were amazing - friendly, accommodating without being intrusive and genuinely interested in doing their best to make our stay enjoyable. The rooms were lovely - the best pillows I've had in any hotel (and the whole group agreed). The fridge (or cooler) in the room was less than adequate - but well compensated for by the two for one specials on cocktails (two for around $7.50!). Spring rolls by the pool for lunch - must do! Massages in house or just a two minute walk away were amazing and great value (under A$20 for a one hour reflexology body massage).

Breakfast was adequate (personally prefer less sugar and more fresh fruit and fresh juices - but overall just fine). Restaurant and bar menu was great. Balinese food was fresh and delicious and even the spaghetti bolognese at 1am hit the spot.

The pool is terrific and well designed for childen (shallow and closer to restaurant). the larger part of the pool is sufficiently separate from this to allow adults to cool off away from other people's kids. Overall great value for money - difficult to understand where there would be value paying 3 or 4 times as much for a comparable place. very pleasantly surprised overall.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1619,Great place for a group getaway !!!!!,40,March 2016,"I have just returned to oz after a three week stay at this hotel. Celebrating my fiftieth birthday with a range of friends and family it was important to select a place that would suit all of our needs. Happy to say ramada was a ""touch down"" all of my guests ranging from 40's to 70's were more than happy. Many of those invited are well traveled and I was expecting the worst - but true to form the 'small' and 'easily ' fixed issues were sooo easily overlooked after meeting the friendly, accomodating and truly respectful Balinese staff. I would not hesitate to stay again. In fact we are working on a second stay now. This time inviting some even grumpier and more judgemental Aussies !!!!! Well done Ramada. So pleased we made the sojourn from our previously booked accomodation to you. 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🤓",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1621,Great service and great staff ! We had a great stay.,40,April 2016,"It was our first trip to Bali. Our rooms were nice and clean and serviced daily. Great pool and also lovely and clean. We enjoyed many a cocktail and Bintang at the pool ! The staff were very respectful and friendly , especially De Darmawan .. ""Darma "" to us ! Thank you Darma for taking such good care of us ! Nothing was ever to much trouble for you .. you are a sweetheart .. thank you again! We loved the massages & facials . all the spa staff are excellent as we went everyday and so got to experience most !! So professional. We tried a massage in Kuta for a cheaper cost but it did not compare to the girls at Ramada. . Worth the extra as it was still cheap to us ☺ Thank you to them all .. also beds very comfortable and awesome pillows !! We wish we could have taken them home ! 24 hr room service was also a plus ☺ we enjoyed our buffet breakfast everyday 👍 Overall we had a very relaxing and great stay at the Ramada Encore ☺",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1622,Great first time Bali experience,50,April 2016,"First time in Bali, had no expectations LOVED this hotel and everything about it. My 9 year old daughter and I had a room on the 5th floor ( tiny) but we only used the room to sleep and store our luggage and goodies from the market,as our friends we were travelling with had a large 3 bedroom suite poolside. The food was not bad, the breakfast buffet had a little of everything and of course staff were courteous. Check in / out was a non issue. HOtel locatiion was out of the way a little but that for peace and tranquility away from all the hustle and bustle. WIll defo stay again and will defo recommend this hotel to others.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1623,Overall great hotel for a very reasonable price!,40,July 2015,"My partner, brother and I stayed there last year for 3 nights and were very happy with our stay. So happy, we are going to go back there this year for another 3 nights.

1. The room: We rented two pool-view rooms up a few levels. The view was really nice, especially in the evenings. The room itself was of average size but the bed was humongous so it may have appeared smaller than it actually was. The bathroom facilities were modern.

2. The pool area was probably the best part of the hotel. It is a lagoon pool that's pretty much takes up the whole outside area. There are plenty of seats for people to sunbathe and lounge around. Overall, the pool is nice for the whole family.

3. Food during the breakfast buffet was quite nice. It can get quite busy so we tended to go a bit early in the morning to avoid the crowd.

4. The only downside is that it's a bit far from the main road and it's a new hotel so not many drivers are fully aware of it. The taxi driver from the airport charged us more by the time we got there because he got lost and had to ask people where it was.

We would definitely recommend it if you want a nice hotel that's new and won't break the budget!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1624,Service lacking,40,March 2016,"The room was fine. The hotel is fairly new so the building is fine. We found the service to be not good. 1.One day it took 40 minutes to receive the order which was a club sandwich and 2 drinks. The drinks came immediately, and we asked them to take them away and bring them with the food. So they were in the frog for 40 minutes until the food came. We had then to ask for fresh drinks as the fizz had gone! 2.The smoking areas were ""flexible"" and we were told different versions of where the area was. Nearly all meals were accompanied by acrid smoke from the next table. And smoking in the pool!
3. the first 3 nights were interrupted sleep from a chair being dragged across the tiled floor above, at 1.30, 3.30 and 630. The front desk seemed not to care. 4. The breakfast menu left a lot to be desired. One had to queue for eggs, and bacon and often had to wait 15 minutes. The tables holding the food were in 2 different locations. Quite disorganised. The cereal was stale. 5. With the air-conditioning on there is a donna and cover supplied. We were still too hot so stripped the donna cover off and only used that to cover ourselves. We did his every night and despite showing by mime to room service that we preferred the cover this way, every day it got put back on! 6. The menu for the restaurant was poor. 7. Although there is no stock in the frig it is not efficient. Not cold enough.The location of the hotel is too remote from the main village. We will not be going back for a return visit.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1625,very bad expierance,20,March 2016,"i have been traveling to asia and other countries the last 7 years 5 years to bali and stay at 4 and 5 star hotels ,i find over 95% of the reviews on hotels ect on trip advisor are perfect but this was very wrong, we thought this hotel was going to be perfect by the reading the reviews i can only say that the people that have given this hotel such fantastic reviews either have not ever stayed at 4 or 5 star hotels before in bali seminyak or are just first timers in bali,on arrival at 2,25pm are room was not ready also they offered us the 1 st floor access to the pool for a extra 200,000 idr a night we said no, we booked the deluxe room some people stated how spacious they are they are not spacious, this hotel is new only open last year first thing we notice they only gave us 1 key and you need to put that key in the power socket for your air con and power so when you leave the room you take your key out and all air con everything goes off so you come back to a hot room,then we notice the large crack in the wall and ceiling in the bedroom and also in the shower bathroom so very bad workmanship in building the hotel,the refrigerator was not cool we brought some fresh milk next day it was off because of the fridge,we told reception and they said they would send someone to have a look at it, that was around 1,pm the guy came next day and look at it and said that is cool as it will get,also they do not have face washers at this hotel it is the only 4 or 5 star hotel i have stayed in seminyak that does not have them,the big problem is because of the poor building design and cheap materials we can hear the people above us moving there chair and the room we had was interconnecting to the next room next door so there was a locked door between our room and the one next to usand for 2 nights the people in that room had a toddler and he was crying at 1am so sound proof not good,also the blackout blinds do not reach the sides or the ground so sunlight wakes you up early morning, we had organised wake up calls in the morning first 2 mornings good next 3 mornings they forgot to wake us and i have cancer and need to take medication at set times after the 3 rd time we told reception and that is 1 thing they did manage to fix the breakfast was just average,my partner is asian and like my partner i love asian food but very hit and miss because over 80% of the guest were chinese or asian decent most of the buffet breakfast was catered for that group of people,also the only air con in the hotel is in your room and the small gym,there are 3 sections in the resturaunt i side has 2 ceiling fans the middle section 4 and the other section no fans so when you had breakfast your sweating as it is so warm,the only highlight of this hotel is the pool without the pool there is nothing,and it is only 1,2 meres deep,this is the only hotel that does not give you the true price on the menu you have to workout the taxes and other charges yourself ,for example a milkshake was 58 thousand approx 6 australian dollars but when we received the bill they added the taxes and other charges and was another 46 thousand added on very expensive more than what we pay for in our country,we had room service 4 times for dinner we payed cash for everything and 1 night they did not come back with our change,we spoke to reception and told them,they said they would contact room service 1 minute later received a call from room service they asked what we ordered the night before and they said they would look into it and off course nothing happened so did not receive my change back,we also had a problem with ants they were all over the toilet they sent someone with a can of spray,the wifi connection was very bad also the internet connection was also slow,the television in room the picture very unclear and also lost of signal when watching a movie it would go off because signal loss,we went for a massage and the spa centre it is just 1 of the small quest rooms converted pn the 4th floor so it was a small room with 2 massage tables and the ensuite toilet this is also another first a new 4 star ?? hotel without a proper spa centre the staff were not friendly in the massage centre maybe because a lack of english like alot of other staff,this hotel is not suitable for couples or singles above the age of 18 is really suited for familes that are on a tight budget,there is only 3 types of room the superior the deluxe and they have 4 3 bedroom family suites there are no junior suites no 1 bedroom seperate living suites no 2 bedroom suites ect that other 4 and 5 star hotels offer,this hotel would be 3 star the rooms are small in Australia and america we would class these rooms as motel type rooms, because thee are no air/con in hotel area except for the bedrooms and the small gym and the distance from all the shops beach resturaunts and the other problems we would never come back to this hotel again,it would be better to spend a extra 25 australian dollars a night to get a 4 star hotel near the beach in seminyak and bigger room,this hotel is more about making money and less about customer comfort or service,the prices are ridiculars because the hotel is so far from resturants ect they have a monoply,the prices we can understand prices in western hotels because staff are paid very well people like me that travel alot to this country know how low the salary is for the staff so you would expect cheaper prices,we payed in advanced for cheaper rate so there was a no fefund otherwise we would have left after the first night but we had prepaid 8 nights we should have stayed at the previous hotels",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Breakfast are amazing , food variant were perfect and much option staff are polite and humble . Room was perfectly clean and well maintain . Very clean with a simple setup it was a very nice atmosphere . But In Room Dinning Staff are so not performing well , no attitude , no any hotelier manner .

1628,Good value for money stay,40,March 2016,"We stayed at Ramada Encore Bali for 4 days. Hotel has a good ambience with a lovely pool and bar/restaurant by its side. Our room was good and spacious. We found the staff also very helpful. The daily buffet breakfast was good, but not excellent. There were few small things which needed improvement such as the mini fridge in the room, which had a pretty slow cooling. But overall we were happy with the service we got for what we paid.
The balinese traditional massage is a must try!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1629,Quiet resort just off the tourist path,40,October 2015,"I loved everything about this hotel. As soon as i arrived, the staff treated me very well. I got there from the airport with no problems, and before my check-in. The nice lady at the front was able to get me a room hours before I was supposed to get one. Over looking the gigantic beautiful pool in the courtyard, I was very pleased. My room had a very modern look and layout with a big flat screen t.v., a king size bed, and a desk. The bathroom was very spacious and well lit. I also used the room service for a couple of meals while I was there and I received great food with perfect timing. Another detail I loved was the fact that I was able to send out my dirty clothes and the housekeeping washed, dryed and folded them by the end of the day for me. I was there on holiday and all I needed to do to go anywhere was go out the front door and they had someone there to call a taxi and give me the costs of whatever trip I wanted to go on up front. So no haggling or no surprises with the end price. I think probably the best part about the resort was the FREE included buffet breakfast every morning that I savored. The buffet had a million options, whatever you eat for breakfast, they had it. Overall, I'd have to say I definitely recommend this hotel and I will definitely will stay here again on my next visit to Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1630,Excellent place for relaxing,50,March 2016,"Overall my stay at the hotel was excellent. Love the pool, nice and comfortable room, staffs were kind and helpful, tasty breakfast, spacious parking lot. I happened to spend my Saturday night at the hotel, which was not disappointing at all because they provide live music and shows at the restaurant. The only thing that a little let down is the location which relatively far from city centers, so you will need transportation to reach the nearby amusement center. Also, please improve the wifi connection. Surely will be back to stay at the hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1631,Great 2 days stay,50,March 2016,"Had a wonderful time at Ramada during my holiday trip at Bali. Quite strategic location, although it's quite hidden. I love their pool, a great place to relax.

Great courteous staff that smile and greet you everytime. Minor setback is the bathroom, somehow it's always wet all over the floor after you've done your shower. Wi-fi is also a bit troublesome because it keeps asking you to sign in, and the connection is unstable.

But overall a great 2 days stay and I can't wait to go back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1632,Good Hotel located at Seminyak.,40,February 2016,"Out first visit to Bali and wouldnot have been better to start our holidays on a good note. Located at Seminyak which is very close to Kuta beach. Good hospitality shown by their staffs.Good food and well maintained swimming pools. The staff were well dressed. One improvement thou,could have had more buffet varieties everyday. Overall a very good experience.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1633,Great Hotel,50,March 2016,"Good Hotel, Fantasic Pool, Large Room with Balcony. Breakfast was reasonable for Westerners - seemed to cater more for the Asian Breakfast Cuisine. Rice, chicken, noodles, etc. Chef on hand would cook eggs of choice. Hard Boiled, Fried, Poached etc. Fruit sometimes only watermelon pieces to go with yogurt. 2 choices of cereal. Overall still provided for good breakfast. Hotel Room said 37 sq. metres but it probably included balcony. Still a very good size room & bathroom. Large swimming pool and reasonable gym. Restaurant was great and local fire performers & Balinese Dancing on many of my 8 nights there. Down side is it is a little bit away from the main shopping areas & nightlife but for me it was perfect. Of around 20 hotels I have stayed at in Bali including 5 Star down to 2 Star Hotels this is one of best hotels I have stayed at as far as value for money goes. I highly recommend this hotel to singles, couples & families. I will definitely be staying in this hotel again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1634,Ok,30,March 2016,Lovely hotel and room. Tita on the front desk was fantastic. A couple of issues as soon as we arrived but rectified immediately. The hotel has a shuttle as it is near nothing built in the rice fields. No shop no money exchange not much around at all. The young man that was driving the shuttle left a lot to be desired. If you are just looking for a relaxing time and don't want to go far this is your hotel. But could honestly not recommend this place mainly as it is so far from anywhere. Sorry but the location is just not there.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1635,"Dark and dingy, not worth the money!",20,March 2016,"I stayed here for one night with friends for our last night before flying back home. Sadly our previous hotel (Courtyard Marriott) was fully booked so we chose this one.

Firstly, it is supposed to be in Seminyak but it is a 30min drive from central seminyak, down some back streets of a residential area! Pool is okay but the rest of the hotel is very dark and dingy.

The superior room was small and also dark and dingy. We had a twin room and one bed had bugs on it?! Bathroom had lots of spiders and wasn't clean, there was some red spattering on the wall by the toilet!

Breakfast wasn't good, no clean dishes and watermelon was warm?! Not for us please.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1636,Worst Hotel with lots of bugs,10,March 2016,"I am still in the room for the night and I have to write this review. I cant wait to sleep and wake up in the morning and get out of this hotel. Luckily only booked for 1 night. Location abit secluded, checked in at night and super tired, bellboy n receptionist are friendly.

I settled down n bath and in the middle of my shower i almost jumped out as there were two big centepedes on the bathroom floor. Got out of the batroom, found another centepede on the floor crawling near my bed. Called receptionist for them to come with bug spray. Adding to the bad experience, i jumped out for the 3rd time as i found a tomcat out near my pillow. Now all i feel all parts of my body is itching. Cleanliness of the Corner of the room also quite bad, so dusty .

I booked pool access room, may be thats why all the bugs coming in and out, but those bugs are still not acceptable! Definetly not coming back here and for the first time I cant wait to check out from the hotel !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1637,The Most Miserable Hotel!!,10,March 2016,"I booked for four nights but only stayed for one with no refund. I thought no hotel could be worst than Hotel Horison Seminyak but this hotel has now top it to become the worst hotel in Seminyak for me!!!

Also, misleading infomation on booking.com website. The hotel is not situated in Seminyak as we know it. It is situated off North of the motor way and no immediate amenities around the hotel.

I went to dinner on my first evening and none of the staff were smiling and again the next morning for breakfast!! I guess they just don't do smiles at Ramada Encore.0

I come to the conclusion that this hotel is for tour groups etc, so they don't focus so much on customer service and definitely not the Balinese hospitality!! In short, this is the most MISERABLE hotel that I have stayed in!! Why pay to get misery???
Ramada Encore HR should get your act together!! Your hotel cannot be so arrogant as to ignore such serious concerns in hospitality business today!!
Do you not walk around your hotel daily to inspect all this??? The restaurant staff urgently need advanced customer care courses!!

Fitri (who checked me in & out) and Tita (helped with the security safe) are very professional, friendly and helpful.

IT'S A NO NO AND NEVER AGAIN!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1638,"Delightful Staff, Breakfast & Top Location",50,March 2016,"The Ramada Encore Bali Resort is a short ride from Denpasar Airport. Its off the main road through a narrow street, adjacent to luxury villas. On arrival, the staff are friendly and calming.

The rooms are well equipped with all that you need for an adventurous holiday in Bali; fitted out with all hotel amenities found anywhere around the world. The beds are very comfortable. Great lodge pillows too!

Breakfast is stellar! With cold & hot choices. This is when you see every hotel guest dine at the restaurant.

The pool is a welcome respite to Bali's tropical heat.

The staff are happy, warm-hearted, genuine and spirited. They exhibit a national pride that is enviable.

This hotel ticks all the boxes in service, from the complimentary breakfast; complimentary shuttles to top shopping locations & kuta beach; complimentary welcome drink on arrival; to the complimentary fast wifi available right around the hotel. They do a lot for their guests.

Our small group of four are already planning a return trip to Bali with more people. We cant wait to return to stay at this hotel.

Thank you for looking after us.

Massage ladies do an awesome job.

Food and beverage staff, work hard all of the time to help all the guests.

Privileged to meet some of the management who are always so warm and friendly.

Asked if I could use the stairs as I don't like elevators they showed me emergency exit stairs, every day I went down them the alarm went of it was so embarrising some days I didn't want to come out of my room because of the alarm! The first day I got there I asked a member of a staff where the towels where he said it was to late! It was only 4pm!! My boyfriend was soacking in the rain and he just couldn't be bovad to help atall! When we ordered food around the pool we would be eating it and they would ask us to sign the bill while we're eating our food! So we couldn't even enjoy the food! I just wanted to say please go away and leave me alone and let me eat my food! I upgraded to another suite because of the stairs kept going of and had to pay another £100 when before going they said to me they provide stairs! It was a complete nightmare from hell!!!

1642,A relaxing stay in pretty surroundings,40,March 2016,"Stayed here for seven nights, in a lagoon access room. Very good value for the price, I reckon. Food at the hotel was very reasonably priced and delicious. Staff were happy and attentive, though most had limited English. Bed and pillows were luxurious (where can I get those pillows?).

Only a few quibbles, for example, a bar fridge kept things no cooler than the room, even sometimes warmer than the room; a bit airless sitting at the bar (fan, please!).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1643,Westerners beware,20,March 2016,Hotel was good some staff good others not understand English and they cater more for Asia tourist than westerners room was good restaurant food was below average and buffet breakfast was poor mainly Asia food my wife found hair in fruit and salad bar and when we told staff no apology was given we will not stay there again was meant to be 4.5 star but we had a better experience at a two star hotel in Legian,Primera Hotel Seminyak

There so many variant for the breakfast menu, supported by adorable view with huge pool and balinese music instrument. the staff, the traditional costume, and the ambience during breakfast makes me so stuck dont want to leave my seat even just to enjoy this.
One point plus that provide by this hotel are shuttle services to main point of bali crowdedness. it's really help for us who have vacation on there without bring any vehicle. i'm definitely in love with this hotel, and could be more if their shuttle services can be completed with pick up service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1650,Hotel stay,40,March 2016,Stayed in the family room 3 bedroom kitchen family room 2 bathrooms upgraded to downstairs where you sun chairs are in the water. Room fantastic. Only problem i found was you had a limit on your tab so if it's s big family you had to pay your tab on a daily basis. There was no money exchange in the hotel. If you need to check out organise your bill at least an hour or two before hand because it took them half an hour for me to check out. You also had to catch a cab to go to eat anywhere,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1651,Great Surprise,50,February 2016,"I was surprised as this was our first stay at the Ramada Encore and we weren't sure what to expect. As we arrived, we were greeted by Tita as she began the check-in process. Throughout our 10 day stay, she was very nice, helpful and went beyond with her high level of customer service.
The room we stayed in, on the 3rd floor, was clean, spacious, and quiet during the entire stay. The location was set back in a neighborhood and 10 min. walk to Sunset Road and another 10 min. to JL Legian. Within a half hour stroll, you can be on the beach. We preferred walking, yet transportation was readily available. Mini-market, med clinic are within 5 min. and Wahaha ribs is 15 min. walk. The ribs at Wahaha were good. The Restaurant at the Encore was very good. The included breakfast was fully supplied with Western and Indonesian dishes. I'm not a large breakfast eater, but my wife was all-in. We had pizza during lunch and it was really good.
The pool was huge and we enjoyed the balcony facing room. The pool was clean and not very busy throughout the stay. There were nightly events at the restaurant end of the pool which had very good singers and Bali dancers on one evening. The music stopped at 10pm nightly.
Finally, I would highly recommend the Ramada Encore as the price is very reasonable what what is included.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1652,My home away from home 😊,50,February 2016,"During my stay in Bali over the last two years, I've stayed at several different hotels in the Kuta and Seminyak area but nothing has yet to compare to the warm, friendly atmosphere at the Ramada Inn Encore. All staff here from the reception to the restaurant aim to make a strong connection with their guests. Tita and Andrey at the front desk were extremely helpful in assisting us with reserving hotel shuttles on a daily basis and resolving other issues that came up during our lengthy stay this year. We always received a friendly greeting by the restaurant staff every morning. Thanks to Gita, Dewi, and especially Era for helping to make us feel at home. These girls played a huge part in making our stay as pleasant as it was! The restaurant manager Wayan Sunarbawa organizes one of the largest all inclusive breakfast buffets that you could imagine. This includes fresh eggs and bacon made to order (any style), a full salad bar, waffles and pancakes also made to order, and they provide a variety of beverages to choose from. In other words, you never leave hungry! Mr. Sunarbawa runs a barbecue several evenings throughout the week. You can enjoy the convenience of the restaurant while also experiencing a Balinese show or live music on any night of the barbecue. They do their best to offer a diverse menu as each barbecue offers a different cuisine such as fish night on Tuesdays, kebabs on Wednesdays, traditional Balinese food on Fridays and my personal favorite; meat night on Saturdays. The prices are affordable and well worth it considering the amount of food you receive for what you pay! The staff here genuinely care and it is their utmost priority that each guest is happy with the food and service. I was personally accosted on more than one occasion by their manager and was asked whether I was happy with the service of his restaurant. As a patron of many places and having a background in the hospitality industry, this is something I always value. Again, such a pleasure to have stayed here and we want to sincerely thank the staff for helping to make our stay as enjoyable as it was!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1653,Value for money with great service.,40,February 2016,"We had 3 rooms. 2 normal rooms and 1 pool access room all at a very good price. Rooms were spacious and clean with aircon. Pool access room was awesome as the pool was literally at your back door yet it was still quite. loved the pool. The service was awesome as it always is in Bali. Breakfast was amazing with a lot of selections. The Wifi was really good we thought it was fast. Would stay again.

It only had one downfall and that was the location, it is not walking distance you have to catch a taxi everywhere. But the hotel taxi's only cost $5 or a bluebird was $3 to Seminyak.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1654,"Value for Money, Friendly Staff",40,February 2016,"Very good and quite luxurious for its price. The rooms were spacious but the bath needs thorough cleaning as it wasn't very clean. The service is great although we had a problem with out booking which has been a real trouble for us. Apart from that, it is an excellent hotel. Location wise, its a bit far from the shops and you'd need to hire a taxi to get there. The pool is huge and the restaurant food is great as well. Thanks to the bar manager reynold and sungar who have been the friendliest that made our stay much more enjoyable.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1655,Feb 2016 stay at Ramada Encore,30,February 2016,"Positives: nice room, lovely pool and restaurant areas,Shuttle bus available although we didn't avail.
No drink service was offered around pool area had to go to bar for drinks.I'm sure they would of made more money in offering this service, as you had to walk through restaurant tables to bar, wet.
Stayed for 11 nights had pool access room private veranda,clean and comfortable.
Price was reasonable.
Negatives: Too far from main shopping restaurant area, says 10 min walk to beach well it was around that in taxi!If you want peace and quiet then this would be ideal.
Buffett breakfast was in our opinion catered for the Asian and Muslim guests.Had to order bacon buy time that arrived eggs were cold not a lot of variety unless you like soup, salads and hot curries rice and noodle dishes for breakfast( Food was lovely but not for breakfast.)
Wifi was hit and miss but you are in Indonesia and get that often in other areas as well.
Staff were not as helpful as other hotels we had stayed in & lack of English was a bit frustrating at times.
Laundry cost not as cheap as a laundry a couple of minutes by taxi and well worth the cost as laundry was cheap and delivered back to hotel in great condition.
would not stay again but that is only due to location.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1656,Valued stay with comfort room,40,January 2016,"Stayed here for 3 nights for business purpose and first try. The room is spacious with the price i paid, bathroom is good size and clean. Happy to get 4 pillow with the budget hotel price, for sure i have a good sleep. The wifi stop lagging or not working from 11 pm which forcing me to sleep since i cant work anymore =)
Breakfast has many variations and staff are friendly. I am happy with my stay but i gave 4 star because i expect management will review and enhanced the wifi speed",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1657,Stay at Ramada Encore,40,February 2016,"The rooms we stayed in were modern, clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was quite tasty with a good variety. Guest Liaison representative Ms Tita was extremely helpful and I would recommend dealing with her when you need transport, transfers or encounter any issues. The other reception staff were less helpful and a lack of English was frustrating leading to misunderstandings. The hallways of the hotels, were often overlooked in terms of being kept clean. The gym was small but had necessary equipment to work out. Overall it was a good hotel but I am unsure if we would go there again due to the lack of a nearby laundry, restaurants or cheap local mini-marts etc.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1658,Great overall,50,February 2016,"Rooms are very clean,i recommend the deluxe which has a pool access with a small veranda+couch. Buffet line has a decent selection. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Not too far from Seminyak Square and just off the main road. Just over a year old and wouald stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1659,Best first time experience to Bali,50,February 2016,This hotel staffs are very friendly and service was top notch.The room was very comfy based on the package offer provided online. Massage is highly recommended since the therapist is very well versed and skillfull on Balinese massage.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1660,Great pool,50,February 2016,"Good first impression when we were upgraded to a larger room for our 2 week stay. The room was large and very nice and the house keeping excellent. The hotel is located a little bit away from the busy hub but a 20 minute walk will take you to main shopping and dining areas.
A 5 minute ride in a taxi will also do this job. The hotel has local taxis parked adjacent so you can catch one at any time. Be warned however that you will pay 50,00 rupiahs to get to places like Bintang supermarket and shopping and dining around there whereas you can walk in 20 minutes for free or alternatively call a Bluebird taxi who will come to the hotel and collect you for a cost of 30,000 rupiahs for the same trip (they have a minimum charge of 30,000 if called but when flagged down you're on the meter which is cheaper). On the way back flag down a Bluebird and it will be less than 20.000 for the journey back from Bintang or Seminyak square. It's not a lot of money but if you're there for 2 weeks the difference quickly adds up.
We ate in quite frequently at the hotel and the menu is quite extensive and the quality of the food is good. The breakfast is buffet style and is excellent.
The highlight is the pool which is enormous and at a very nice temperature.
The staff are all smiley and courteous and could not be more helpful",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1661,Perfect Place.,50,February 2016,"We stayed at the Ramada Encore all together for 3 weeks. The staff is incredibly friendly and the hotel made our time on Bali absolutely wonderful. The room rates are more than fair for what you get (massive breakfast, gym, great pool, awesome service, scooter rent) we would always come back and already recommended it to so many people.
Even throughout their water problems, when the streets in Bali were flooded, they tried everything to accommodate guests to a new hotel, or as we didn't want to leave, made us feel as comfortable as possible!
Thank you for the good time Ramada. See you soon.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1662,love the hotel,40,February 2016,"i loove the spacious room, clean, nice, friendly and helpful staffs. i looove the swimming pool and of course the food :)

1666,Out of the way budget hotel,20,February 2016,"Rooms were clean but small. Staff were not very helpful, rude and spoke very little /broken english (even for Bali standards). Breakfast was probably the best part of the stay. Pool was big and clean but no pool bar was disappointing. Hotel very out of the way - always need a taxi or scooter to go anywhere (even to the nearest convenience store). Wouldn't stay there again even if i was paid too.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1667,Nice hotel and lovely staff,40,February 2016,"I stayed here with friends for four days and three nights. Although there had been some issues with the receptionist about the number of rooms booked, i would say that i enjoyed my entire stay in this hotel. The best part would be the staff, from the people greeting us in the lobby, waiters, Rey from the bar, and even the F&B manager who made me/us feel really welcome all throughout our stay. Overall great service, foods, drinks, and the best live acoustic bands. 😅👍",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1668,good to stay though bit inside from main road,40,February 2016,"service staff are polite, helpful and speak good english
the room is really spacious, clean and neat
the hotel is bit inside from the main road but accessible though street light are very less
hotel amenities are good, breakfast food is good, they also help to cook vegetarian if you dont find you food in the spread
we didnt get hot-water for the duration we stayed there except before we check-out as there was some maintenance issue",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1669,"2nd, 3rd, 4th times are charming",50,December 2015,"I stayed a total of 36 nights over a 10 weeks period. The first time I stayed there I thought it was isolated and far from everything. But once I learned how to get around (private drivers with private cars), this place became an oasis at the end of any long duration outing. This property has North American dimensions everywhere. The pool is its most outstanding feature. But the rooms, the TV, the restaurant...all excellent. The pool has no swim up bar but the wait staff brings you whatever you want wherever you desire. Highly recommend you get a pool view room. I like my privacy so I did not take a poolside room but it would have been more convenient.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1670,First visit to Ramada Encore hotel,40,February 2016,"Wonderful hotel overall. Good food, excellent room size (agoda mentioned 37m2) with proper twin bed size, clean, nice pool as well and it located in residential area which means quite silent. Minus points were : strictly on 2 PM check in even advance notice been informed for early check in. Only have 2 pair-elevators with long distance between. Parking area a bit further from the lobby and no shades at all. Take about 8 km or equal to 25 minutes from hotel to kuta beach.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1671,Budget hôtel,30,February 2016,"The room was very clean. Very nice staff and helpful. Good prices for transport. The massage at their Spa was good. Thé Spa is a hotel room therefore nô further options in treatments then massages. Breakfast is good , the egg station and a large Buffet ; from chicken curry and salads for breakfast to croissants.
Front office staff is very helpful and polite. Good car service as the location of the hotel is not in a good neighborhood.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1672,Great Cosy Hotel with Relaxed Atmosphere,40,January 2016,"My wife and I have stayed in a few budget hotels as well as world's leading and best 5 star Hotels but Ramada Encore is a little gem that will not disappoint. At first you may think when you are headed to the hotel through the narrow roads that this may not be what you'd hoped for. But you couldn't be more wrong. As soon as you arrive on the entrance you get a feeling this would be a cosy place to say, relaxing and away from the more hustle and bustle of Kuta yet not too far. Through the reception is the restaurant which opens up into a spacious area adjoined to the swimming pool. You could easily sit at the restaurant with your partner and kill time with ease. The whole theme is relaxed. The staff are always with a smile although they could be more attentive at the reception as there were times guests were waiting to be served and a little acknowledgement at times can go a long way. The room was spacious enough and the balcony overseeing the swimming pool was great. Try sitting there when there is light rain. Quite peaceful and romantic. You will not be disappointed to return to this hotel after a day's activities to relax or sleep. The TV was also good with decent channels although there were lots of Balinese ones. The breakfast at the restaurant was good enough. Nothing extravagant or spectacular but definitely good quality. The cakes however were really good and really moist. All in all, we loved the Ramada Encore and we would happily recommend to other couples, family or groups traveling together. A touch of improvement to the service at the reception would greatly help its scores.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1673,Good Hotel with good price :-),40,February 2016,"Just have had an experience stay with this hotel and i feel excited to share since i was experience with flooding during stay there.
i was stay for 4 night and 2nd onward was heavy rain in Bali and causing some area is over flood including Seminyak area where the hotel located. It was serious flooding happened in this area, this is force majeur and nothing wrong with the hotel. I would say from the hotel is handle very well and help guest with quick response and properly. i keep stay there and nothing to worry about at all. No water in the bath room but hotel prove gallon of water so again i am no worry at all.

The Room was good, the pool is spectacular, breakfast was good and staff is so friendly and i am happy that wi fi is all around the corner, worry free for the internet connection :-)

The price is good as most concern. Keep it a good jobs!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1674,Budget hotel but luxurious & excellent staff,50,February 2016,"I stayed here for 2 days on the 3rd & 4th Feb, check in was a breeze. I have been here a couple of times before and it's one of my favourite budget hotel but still consider it luxury as its still modern and quite new.I love the lagoon pool, to their buffet breakfast, their hotel spa and the staff is the best. Everything was still the same as to my previous stays, rooms are still nice we always get the room with pool view, their balcony is quite spacious and so are the rooms. Their buffet breakfast still good and decilious with a variety of dishes, I really liked their mini pancakes, chicken rice porridge and the butter they provide. Used the hotel spa and it was really good and relaxing and affordable. The staff are the best they really are. I need to mention this on our last day we had to check out in the afternoon found out the streets outside was flooded due to non stop rain and rainy season. So some guest had to catch a flight that night including myself and we were worried we were not going to be able to catch our flight and the staff was trying to do everything they can so we were able to catch our flight. The problem was that taxi's and cars could not get into the hotel as the flood was quite deep and cars would of gotten stuck by the water. The amazing staff decided to carry our luggage on their backs and assisted us to walk through the flood as this was the only way we can catch a taxi on the other end that wasn't affected by flood, seeing as they could not drive through the floods. I had 4 huge luggages that they carried through the flood,they carried my son out on his back and I think he was the manager, and I just thought what they did for us was courageous, hard work, customer service minded and I have total respect for them for all the efforts. Not only did they assist me with that but other guest too that had to catch a flight that night. So I just want to say thank you to all the staff there especially all the men that assisted me that night. You guys are fantastic and I would always recommend your hotel and will always return.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1675,Very nice hotel,40,February 2016,"I really enjoyed this hotel. Facilities are good, room big and bathroom clean.

Beautiful friendly staff that assisted with every need,I had my 50th Birthday here and the staff organised a cake for me- Thank you. Comfortable huge beds with the best pillows ever, Massive lagoon pool we had pool access. Meals in the restaurant were very tasty and well priced. Cocktail promo tried more that once. Cheap and easily accessible transport from hotel into Seminyak. Daily free shuttle bus to Kuta, Seminyak and beach. Fantastic value for price. All 21 of us an amazing holiday thanks so much, hope we will be back again one day.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1678,excellent place to stay,40,February 2016,hotel staff and services are very good. Nice people nice place to stay. Little far from beach but you can take bicycle which is provided by the hotel @10000 INR(Rs 50 for 6 hours) and ride to the beech which is 20 mins by bycyle,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1679,The hotel mess my holiday,10,February 2016,"I booked this hotel through travel agent, I choose this hotel because of 4 star. when I came to Bali, I have difficulty to find the place (can you imagine 4 star hotel position in small path???)
when I checked in, the receptionist told me that due to the flood 2 days before, the hot water and the pool can not be accessed, and they asked me, I will cancel my order or accept this condition, (I came from another island, just came ini by car, and very exhausted, and already paid to my travel agent), I asked her when the hot water can be normal again, and she said today.
But until 3 days (until I checked out) there is no hot water, (every morning and evening I asked them when the hot water can be normal again??)
After I heard that some people offered to relocated to another hotel (on my 3rd night there), I made complain to in charge manager, and he said he will arrange my relocation, but no more information from the hotel.
Very poor customer satisfaction and very clear that there is a difference between local tourist and foreign from the breakfast (the food taste 6.5/10 -- poor)
They really mess my holiday
they promise that the General Manager will see me during my breakfast on my last day to talk about compensation, but she just gone and never mind about me (as local tourist).
Still waiting for explanation
I've made my complain to the group (Wyndham) and their reply is I have to make my complain to the hotel.
What kind of service excellent????
VERY not recommended hotel for Indonesian people, their valued customer is foreigner, not us.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1680,A very recommended hotel,50,February 2016,"Although the area is a little bit walks from shops and other public area, there is a shuttle car that can transport you to the nearest area. We have stayed for 6 times here and will come back again. Staffs very friendly, nice pool, comfortable bed with clean bedroom even the floor feel a little""sticky"" but never mind there are slippers in every room. Breakfast also great and enough varieties food. Even the hotel has big problem with big flood caused of big rain 3days ago which caused floods everywhere in Bali, they still can manage and fix the pool so everything still fine for us. Will never get bored stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1681,Good value hotel,40,January 2016,"The hotel is a bit of a walk to anywhere worthwhile but the plus is that it's in a quiet area, taxis are cheap and within ten minutes or less you are in the middle of all the action.
The pool is great, food was good and about the same price as eating out.
Breakfast selection was good.
Nice rooms, modern, comfortable. It's Ramada ... Not Raffles.
The only problem I had, the mainlanders. Noisy, pushy, rude and generally irritating especially when there are large groups. If you want a peaceful breakfast, maybe order it to the room.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1682,Ramada Encore Seminyak,30,February 2016,"This is my first staying with Ramada Encore Seminyak. Booked this through Agoda. Hotel price is pretty reasonable for 4 Stars. This Hotel is away from buzzling city and is for people that want to stay in quiet place. It has nice swimming and food in the restaurant not bad. The staffs there well very nice.

The problem came when the Hotel street was flooded for first time. We got to walk as family about 8minutes to reach the Hotel lobby with the staff. The water is as high up to the our waist. Many guests were affected and quite upset, There was no apology at first and no resolution given.

The next day, you receive a letter from the Hotel GM. They apologize for the inconvenience and damage is done. No mention of the guests walk outside the street to reach the Hotel. No follow up on the guests that were wet entirely and no further offering for guest laundry. Next thing that is quite unacceptable, no water in the morning. When contacted, the staff inform that they close the main tab due to the badly damaged due to flood. They provide gallon waters but question how to take shower?

I seldom complaint. But due to no recovery. Staff continue to tell the guest that the water in the room will resume in the afternoon. Since no further action, we went out for day tour. Back at 9pm, the staff mention that there is no water in room after tiring day and no further follow up.

Fortunately, I ask to speak to the manager. They move our family to Harris. This is the only solution given. Encore is one of the international brand, a courtesy call could have been extended to the guests since the water does not resume. Staffs were friendly but the challenge remain not train to handle situation.

Many things could have been done to make the stay of the guests memorable. Important to review process. People, process and product are absolutely crucial. The competition is great. If you don't bother. You will continue to lose guests. Humble giving advise.

Thank you and hope the management look into this positively. Need to work on process and improve the maintenance of the Hotel so you do not lose out credibility. Cheers,
Michael Lee",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1683,"Great deal includes breakfast buffet, reasonably clean and friendly staff. would return",40,January 2016,"We got a super good deal with the rooms and decided to get our own rooms each! Yes, that's how good of a deal it was, it included buffet breakfast, too. The breakfast buffet was excellent, everything was fresh! The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. The spa was also excellent, I had the signature massage and the de-stress back massage, both with Desak, who I should say is exceptional. I would go back to get my massage from her! Also very easy to get a taxi or hire a private driver. Plus, the hotel provides a free shuttle to Seminyak Square though last trip is at 5pm. The location was not a problem for me, quick drive to Seminyak Square and nearby restaurants. Just not by the beach which is not a problem for me but may be a ""look for"" for some people. Pool looked great though did not have any time to take a dip.
• Wish the spa hours could have been longer, they close at 9pm with 8pm as the last booking you can get. You're just getting out of dinner or coming back from sightseeing. I also wished I could have gotten Wyndham reward points but I was told that since I booked through Booking.com I couldn't get the points. Kinda sucks since I did stay at the hotel anyway and Booking.com doesn't have any rewards program as far as I can tell.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1684,Modern and great property...,40,January 2016,"Was stay there at the end of January 2016, my rooms are big and perfectly clean and neat but no slipper available on it, they also have awesome lagoon pool and well maintained. Other side that need to improve are staff at the pool, not helping me when I asked a towel, they said have to go to FO firs. So the security as well, I guess to overwhelming to my guest who like visit me for 10 to 15 minutes by asked and left ID before entering hotel area, bit uncomfortable with it. Overall Ramada Encore is great property and good value for the price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1685,Amazing Holiday,50,January 2016,"Firstly come stay at the hotel and for the staff are a friendly more very helpful everytime. and i have a good room more very tidy and special flower and chocolathe cake from staff reception. but just breakfast was good just for the taste not delicious(fried rice).

I will recommend this hotel and will coming back for next time for stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1686,Good Value,40,January 2016,"I chose this resort because it was close to people I was visiting. The price was very good value, it was clean and the food excellent. Recommended.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1687,Good value for the price,40,January 2016,"This is a good hotel for the price but it isn't really in walking distance of shops and restaurants. It will cost you anywhere from 30 to 80 baht (depending on your destination and choice of transport provider) to travel into main shopping/restaurant areas. The hotel does provide a free shuttle bus but it only runs twice a day and has limited seating so you need to book early. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Room was very clean and a decent size and had a good sized verandah. Air conditioning was very good. Pool and pool area was exceptionally clean and well maintained. Day Spa massage was amazing! Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast was decent and provided enough choice but the other hotel food was just average. Really, for the price this is a great value hotel, especially if you are after something more on the quieter side but still in Seminyak. I would go back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1688,Modern and clean hotel,50,January 2016,"Made a great decision to stay here. Lovely feature where the pool consumes the enclosed centre of the hotel so all the rooms have a pool or even pool access. Modern room design with balcony. Good choice on the breakfast and the room service menu offered lots of choice and good value.

Hotel is a little away from the hub of the shops and bars in Seminyak,but a taxi only costs 30000 Rupiah(£1.50) one way. We had a spa treatment but the room itself was a converted bedroom and didn't have the usual spa feel or ambience (eg no relaxing music during our treatment).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1689,Lovely hotel but off the beaten track!,40,January 2016,"Overall the hotel was fabulous! Pool was great, staff were awesome, room was clean & well presented. Breakfast was fresh with a medium selection range but food supplied was good & resturant next to kids pool so kids can swim while adults eat or enjoy a drink. You can't really walk anywhere so be prepared to use hotel shuttle service & taxi back at your own cost (relatively cheap) One of our shuttle services to Kuta was actually a driver & when asked about a taxi back he said he would pick us up, taxi back would of cost us 80,000 Rp he collected us but charged 200,000 Rp, lesson learnt as Blue Taxis from Kuta are readily available. Hotel could use a small convenience / souvenir shop which would make life easier! De-Stress massage was absolutely amazing & relatively cheap for a hotel compared to other Bali offerings. Only real complaint was one night my daughter called room service &was told to call back in 10 mins as they were busy - not really acceptable, you're busy, we're paying guests & hungry! Other than that can definately recommend!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1690,Few hiccups....but well worth it,50,January 2016,"Great place for families, stayed in family suite which was very spacious and modern.
Fantastic huge pool for adults and kids (photos do not do justice) staff were very friendly. Restaurant was good value, food was a bit hit and miss serving sizes varied day to day....SPA/Massage was terrific and really good value. Shuttle served us well into Kuta & Seminyak.Our only real problem was the card key to our rooms, on 6 occasions we were locked out, twice we were able to alert night security below to get help, other times we had to make the trek to reception, we were on the 3rd floor right at the back, quite a hike when you have 3 little ones in tow...no real explanation was given, though on one occasion we were told our card was not validated?
Would we stay again....Definately",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1691,Excellent service and beautiful hotel,50,January 2016,"Only thing I would say that is slightly negative is the location is a teeny far out, you can't really walk to the bintang supermarket/shopping area but taxis are pretty cheap and the hotel staff are happy to order one for you. I arrived and was very pleasantly surprised, literally paying peanuts for incredible 5* treatment! Very spacious rooms with free wifi, a television, wonderful shower (I think I paid $50 Aus dollars for two nights) which was a bargain for the great service. There is a restaurant outside by the pool with a wide variety of Indonesian foods and cheap cocktails. Just be aware of the service charge and tax which isn't included (but I guess everywhere in bali is the same). I had a balinese massage for 10,000 IDR (about $10 aus) which was wonderful and my friend had a 1.5 hour destress massage which she said was very relaxing and professional too! Staff are polite and courteous and friendly, treat you very well and are very helpful with bags/check in ect. Offered a free complimentary drink in arrival :) hotel is good for families, couples, solo travellers and friends! Would definitely recommend and return!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1692,buzzing with activities,40,January 2016,"Location : More than ideal. Very close to beach,Airport, shopping , tattoo, food, etc

Service: Good, friendly & fast. Absolutely no hiccups in my 4 days.

Room: I took the 35 sq mtr room which is quite spacious. The balcony was good. No disturbing noises. good toiletries. Spacious bathroom. Had a small fridge and a safe.

Food: Average by Asian standard. However, the live music during breakfast & Dinner and next to a huge pool makes it a good experience. Don't try fried ice-cream. Its bad.

Lobby: Good.

Other: Cycle on rent, meter taxi stand close by. Electric iron with ironing table provided on request.

At $42 per night all inclusive, its great value.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Our room was nice and clean, with two complimentary bottles of water every day. The only downside was the wifi. It didn't reach our room very well and we had to move around until we got a strong enough signal to use it. Asides from that, our room was wonderful with pool access and very close to reception and the restaurant area.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1696,Great Family destination for Bali,50,January 2016,"Me and my partner took our 4 adult kids to this resort and had a ball, 3 bedroom apartment was big and spacious and we walked out into the pool. It was a bit out of town but there is a free shuttle we used at 10am and 5pm we were able to barter for cabs to take 6 of us for around 150IDR which was great and only a small price to pay as the 6 of us needed a big cab, we loved the buffet breakfast, great variety of food and pool side service was incredible, food and drinks were very reasonably priced, had a great time and would definately stay again, pool and room serviced daily, we were there for a week and had a ball, highly recommend this place, great staff and had booked massages too at the resort for 4 of us. There is no problems at all, great room, service and staff all excellent and we felt safe there too as the security is 24hrs too. Anthony C.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1697,All in one value,50,January 2016,"If you are looking for a great value 'resort type' facility then look no further! Ramada encore delivers an amazing experience for under $60aud p/n. Clean rooms, amazing resort style pool and great staff in the bar led by Sunar who along with his staff have one goal in mind... To ensure their guests needs are accommodated to all the time! With a gym, childcare facility and a great buffet breakfast, we can't fault ramada. Location is separated from Seminyak square, although the concierge will happily arrange a blue bird cab for you which costs approx $3 one way or just take the shuttle if you are prepared to wait. If you want 5 star luxury then pay $300 per night, although if you are content with a comfortable room, with great facilities all around, then ramada is for you!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1698,Need some thorough supervisory expertise,30,January 2016,"First off I was given an appalling room overlooking a work site and with a balcony with no access. I requested an upgrade and happily were shown to a pool access room the next morning which was much better. The pool was beautiful and I have absolutely no complaint about that but unfortunately that is where it stopped. Too far away from everything, needed to get a taxi to EVERYTHING, quite a pest. The food was lacking and the breakfast very disappointing. The bar had no sparkling wine at all even though it was advertised throughout the area. Staff needed a lot of training, ran around like chooks with their heads chopped off really. Could be a good out of the way stay if someone with a bit of experience got in there and shook things up a little.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1699,Nice stay,50,January 2016,"I got offering to stay at Ramada Encore Seminyak from Bali Getaway for a very good price. Check for review on trip advisor is very recommended and when i get there, yes it is same with we expect. It is still new hotel around 2 years they said. The interior is good and the air condition is cold which i like it. Also the pool is quite big and although Encore is not a 5 star ht but they have pool direct access from room. Breakfast is good and the staff is very friendy. But the location is quite far from main road (Sunset road), lucky me I already rent a car. Oh ya, near the hotel (around 10 minutes drive car), there is Wahaha pork rib and Malen pork rice.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1700,"Great value for what you pay, but don't expect luxury",40,January 2016,"This hotel offers excellent value for what you pay. I'm bemused as to why so many reviewers are whinging ... honestly, this place is really cheap so what exactly were you expecting?! I stayed with a friend and a twin share. No problems with cleanliness. Our rooms were cleaned to a satisfactory standard every day. Bathroom was stupidly designed so water from the shower kept splashing onto the floor which was messy and annoying, but that's my only complaint. Beds were comfortable and there is a safe in your room to store your valuables. Wi-fi was fast and reliable both in our room and out in the common areas.

The pool is fantastic and we never had a problem with towels. The bar, however, is over-priced - we avoided using this facility.

With taxis, you need to be specific and tell the staff you want a metered Bluebird cab. They will oblige; we never had a problem getting a metered cab either to or from the hotel. The location is not great, but there's no need to spend a fortune on private cars unless you want to.

This hotel doesn't really distinguish itself and doesn't have much vibe and personality, but I think it's fine for the money you pay. I mean, if you want 5-star then pay a 5-star price instead of being cheap and expecting luxury just because you're in Bali! If you Come with the right expectations, you will not be disappointed.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1701,Horrible Experience.,10,January 2016,"First day check in, the hotel room's floor were sandy and dusty. Brown stains everywhere on the floor. Had to ask them to clean up the room.

Also, the room has a pool view but were blocked by a big tree? What is the point of paying extra for pool view? Avoid room 2144!

If you are using the hotels bath towels, make sure you check on the towels before you use it. There were a lot of stains on it. In total I had requested to change more than 8 bath towels and had the room service to deliver to me personally over 4 days.

The utensils, tea cups, plates were not wash properly. There were stains on most of the plates and cups during breakfast. Other guest were looking for clean plates too.

Breakfast was bad except for the egg station.

The best part was that the hotel staffs ruined my wife's birthday. Was informed that there will be a surprise on her birthday but ended up no surprise at all. Had to email to the reservation team and ask them what was going on. The reservation team replied that they tried to contact me via the hotel room number but we were out. They didn't even try to contact me via my mobile number that was given during the booking.

So the next day, the reservation team emailed me back saying that they have prepared a birthday cake and would like me to inform the reception when i'm back in the hotel.

Came back to the hotel, requested them to send the cake to the swimming pool at the reception. The cake didn't come. Disappointed again. Went to the reception and complained about it. Feeling so frustrated when its almost checkout time.

The cake finally delivered to the room when we were busy packing for checkout.

The customer service is very bad. Didn't enjoy my stay at all in this hotel.

Do not book this hotel. There are other better hotels in Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1702,A few issues and no way to tell them,20,January 2016,"The pool was fantastic!
The shower had black mould, there was always a line up from eggs in the morning and bacon had to be requested (and then you only got a small amount after the wait!)
The pool bar doesn't actually serve the drinks, the drinks and tax are higher than they should be, the food menu didnt interest me. There was no information about pool times, closing pool time for chlorination, events, towel hire options (we thought we had to give our room card every day to get a towel when we found out we could've kept a pool towel for the whole stay and Not gone up to the room soaking wet!), breakfast times, shuttle times etc. u would've liked to give some advice on how to improve breakfasts, information etc but there was never an option to.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1703,choose another if you can,30,January 2016,"the best thing in this hotel is only the swimming pool.
We booked pool view room for our stayed in Ramada,We stayed there for 2days. The room we stayed was moist,the floor of the room was slippery to the point where my child (1Y10M) fall down,the bed also felt moist,i called to complain and they said the reason is the hotel was full,so /the AC below my room made the room moist, Asked them to changed the room they said no room available for the day,they will informed us the next day,till the second day around 16.00pm the other room still not ready,They said they will call to change for us,but they never called,so we decide to just let it go. Not a good experience, and plus the hotel is far from everywhere.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1704,Amazing hotel for the price with wonderful staff but slightly out of the way.,50,January 2016,"We decided to stay here for our first trip to Bali and wanted something quite cheap as we had spent a lot on hotels etc for out previous 2 weeks in Thailand.
This hotel is unbelievably cheap - we paid £22 per night for 4 nights including breakfast.
The staff have to be some of the most attentive and friendly I have ever come across and the hotel really has the feel of and professionally run establishment. On hand at all times for anything we needed, (booking day trips, taxis, arranged a Dr in 20 minutes when my partner was very sick) which made such a difference.
The buffet breakfast had a lot of good choice and the restaraunt food was OK too. The only downfall for me was that this hotel is quite out of the way, and as we found on our first night, it isn't the safest area outside of the hotel. 2 guys on a moped tried to steal my partner's phone out of his hand whilst we were walking home. Needless to say we took taxis EVERYWHERE after this. The staff at the hotel advised that we didn't walk anywhere outside the hotel. This was a little worrying! But inside the hotel feels VERY safe and we both really, really enjoyed staying here.
I'd absolutely recommend this hotel since the taxis are so cheap it doesn't matter so much it is a bit out of the way.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1705,Great value for money,50,January 2016,"We really enjoyed our stay at ramada. We stayed her at the start of our trip and again at the end.

Really friendly staff, we arrived super early on the overnight flight an lobbed at tge hotel at 9am. Staff were really nice and whilst our room wasnt ready yet we just lay by the pool for a couple hours until it was.

The restaurant was reasonably priced an surprisingly so was the spa. We ate 2 dinners in restaurant and had a couple of massage.

They have cabs waiting out front with fixed prices do u cant get taken advantage of an they were very prompt.

Gorgeous pool with sun lounges in the water an plenty of umbrellas.

All in all a great value for money hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1706,Value for money,30,January 2016,"Very friendly staff, will accommodate to your requests if you can get there attention.
They need to have pool service, for all areas of the pool they should do what hotels do in Fiji, have a flag with half red and half blue, turn it up to red if you need service and blue if you don't need anything. Then you don't have to try and get them to take your order. Saves a lot of frustration.
They need more fans around the bar desperately and in waiting areas near reception !!!! Too hot and very uncomfortable to sit !!!!!! Very hot for staff too.
Need to have hand towels and face washers in bathrooms instead of bath mats.
Overall we still had a very good time as stated before staff are fantastic and accommodation is good value for money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1707,Great breakfast and pool,40,January 2016,"We had the room at the corner and have bigger room than other. Breakfast was great many choices from eastern to western, and you should try the waffle with honey don't forget to ask for bacon at the egg station.. yuuumm.
Pool is huge, clean. And you can relaxed at the balcony.
The downside is, i have run to little crawl thing with many legs, don't know the name, at the bathroom and since then it give me an allert evertime I am going to the bathroom, the cleanliness should be upgraded. One more tha ac layout directly to the bed maybe it's because the corner room. Well you can get it all..",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1708,Very good experience and recommended,40,January 2016,"Ramada encore seminyak is up to their standard considering it's a 4 star hotel and their price. Love their swimming pool, it's clean and nice view. So upgrade your room to deluxe pool view room at least. Room is comfy enough and any slight problem can be cleared by hotel staff. Quite pleased with their service. Breakfast is mediocre according to me.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1709,Had a Fantastic time!,50,December 2015,"I must say that I have had a wonderful time staying at the Ramada Encore!
I found the hotel very nice. First of all I loved the breakfast and food available.
The rooms were very nice, the pool was awesome as was the live music. Most
of all though, I found the staff were really nice and friendly. Special thanks to
Dian from the corporate office who was fantastic. I will be coming back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1710,2nd visit in 3 month,40,December 2015,"My first stay here on October 30, 2015, and we occupy a very comfortable room on the second floor if I am not mistaken in 2142, the rooms are so amazing with a huge bed and comfortable (we have 2 children aged 2 years and 8 months) we so loved it. and on our second visit we stayed on 19-21 December 2015, we chose the same type of room as on our first visit, but we did not get the room, we get a third floor room, the same room size but not the size of the bed :(
we liked the bfast, all the hot dishes, pastries and everything. but not with your coffee machine. The coffee machine is not suitable to meet the needs of guests at breakfast. The coffee machine is suitable for a coffee break at the meeting. hehe
but overall I really liked this hotel, all the facilities, services and very attractive prices.
we will definitely be back again. maybe during Nyepi this year.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1711,Would not stay again. Not an honest hotel.,10,December 2015,"When we first arrived at the hotel at 3pm, we apparently could not check in as the room was not ready. The rest of my family had already arrived and checked into the 5 booked rooms, so all we needed was the keys to our room. This proved to be extremely difficult and in the end I had to get my dad down to reception to sort it out. Eventually we got the keys to the room....however I found the room to be quite dirty, floor was not clean and there was mould in the bathroom and all throughout shower, which is surprising as this hotel was only built a year ago.
The bed linen was dirty. I requested it to be changed and was no better.
The hotel is a bit of a way out, when getting a taxi back to the hotel we usually had to direct the driver where to go using our phone maps as they had no idea.
The pool was lovely, but staff were not on top of clearing items from around the pool area, by the end of the day our area was littered with bottles, plates and glasses.
The gym is tiny. On one occasion there were no towels to use or water in the gym.
Towels seem to be a big issue at this hotel... We could not seem to get a pool towel, and the rest of my family had this same issue. In the end we used our bathroom towels, but getting new ones was nearly as hard as getting pool towels!
Tried to organise using the spa, when we asked about the spa at reception the guy just walked away from us and started doing something else!
Bar drinks aren't really cheap and food at the restaurant was average. Breakfast is probably the highlight of this hotel.
My sister accidentally left a few dresses in the wardrobe, due to an early/rushed check out. She contacted the hotel that morning to inform them she would be back to pick up the clothes in a few days time. When she arrived back at the hotel to collect her clothes the hotel didn't know where they were, even though the policy is for housekeeping to put any left behind items in the lost and found. I find this appalling that the hotel has let their staff get away with stealing someone's clothes without even looking into it. I will be telling everyone I know to stay away from this hotel and their theiving staff.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1712,Third Visit for 2015.,50,December 2015,"It is not very often I visit the same hotel more than once because I like to try different ones, seeing there are so many. However, my partner had not been with me on my other 2 trips and I wanted him to see the Ramada Encore. We opted for a pool access room, this time, so now I have tried all the different rooms here. The first night we arrived late and somehow ended up with a pool-side room, which is not the same. We were told that there was a pool access room but the house boy had gone home and the room had not been made up. A little disappointing seeing we had to move but the room was available by 8am the next morning, so we moved before going to breakfast. There certainly is something about just being able to walk off your terrace and straight into the pool - we loved it. As I have said before, breakfast is good but we really noticed this time the number of inconsiderate people smoking around us while we were eating and wish that hotels and restaurants would put a stop to this. It was the only thing that we had an issue about in the 4 days that we were here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1713,Worth The Price.,40,January 2016,"It was located at a dead end where sometimes some cab doesnt really know the place.
Walking (slow pace) to Seminyak Beach Takes about 1/2 an hr (without window shopping)
The Walking in the morning and noon is alright, but if it's getting late, the road can be very dArk and Quiet (' sepi 'in indon)
Lemongrass Welcome Drink, Bottomless haha!
Breakfast served at 6.30-10.30am, there are plenty of seats right beside the pool.
There are also benches prepared at the shallow side of the pool for you to relax
The room is very clean, new, cozy with ard 60 channels on TV.
Hospitality by te staffs was Great.
From the reception, restaurant, housekeeping, everyone is ready to serve.
Breakfast Buffet is different everyday but with Some Standard Food like Sausages, egg, bread, salad etc etc
Overall, i like this hotel.
CLEAN COZY SIMPLE and it's CHEAP!!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1714,Stayed for 3 nights,30,December 2015,"Got the room at ground level (pool view), room door was facing those tall trees and abandoned building (i guess) and got scared whenever walked out the room coz it is really dark. Our balcony facing e pool was so so..its good to trim down ur tress as it felt like in a small jungle.

Rooms was superb with big beds, couch, and huge rooms.

Breakfast - varieties...but food is almost the sane everyday. receptionist lady clained ALL the food served there was Halal but was quite a shocked to see they had pork chop in the hotel!!

Location wise, yes it is far deep inside but i have no issues coz we hired a driver for our trips!

Big swimming with loads of ppl!

Overall nice stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1715,Awesome View at Pool Access !!!,40,December 2015,"This place is just ideal to meet a budget-good-quality service and accommodation. I get up free room upgrade from standard deluxe to pool access deluxe. Apart from that, staff are very friendly and very informative and helpful, the location quite average because its locate little bit far from the main road. Furthermore the room very comfortable and the pool really enjoy to play with your kids!

Stayed Decemger 2015, traveled with Big family",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1716,Amazing Encore Bali!!,50,December 2015,"Since my wife and I got into the Ramada Encore Hotel everything went pretty well. The welcoming was very friendly, and staff in the reception were always ready to assist us to make us feel as home. Rooms are very nice and the facilities are good enough as any high standard hotel. The very next morning, we found the most kind and gentle staff in the Mahadawi restaurant; I would like to mention that Gita, Enra and Dewi were so special, and they did the most they could do to make us feel in a 5 starts hotel. Moreover, I would like to make a special mention to all the team who always worked so hard to provide the best service. Also, room and housekeeping services were good enough.
Just I would like to recommend, a bit more attention with the shower cleaning, and if its possible think about to re-design the screen shower, is not efficient at all. Also, think about the possibility to get an ATM service in the hotel, could be very helpful for guests who need get access to it.
Finally, I would like to thank to all the Ramada Encore Team, and if I visit Bali in the future I hope to spend few days in this Hotel again!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1717,In summary an average stay,30,December 2015,"We stayed at the Ramanda Encore for 5 nights over the New Year period. The first impression of the hotel was good. Friendly staff at reception, nice large pool and decent sized room. We stayed in a deluxe room with pool views. The breakfast buffet had Asian and western options and was good. The gym is small but is equipped well enough for exercising.
But there have been a few things which made our stay lesser enjoyable. The hotel ran out of pool towels halfway through the day. For a swim in the afternoon you had to go back to the room and get your own towel. The hotel is in the outskirts of Seminyak which isn't an issue as such. Problem only is that getting transport from the hotel is a nightmare. The free shuttle service the hotel offers is a bit of a joke. You pretty much have to book it the day before and its only one shuttle service which means 7 people get a lift. When asking for a taxi you will be offered their private transport service which is way overpriced. You better off walking down the street to get a cab. The thing I found irritating was that drink prices suddenly when up on the NYE party at the hotel which I think is a bit cheeky to do.
All in all our stay was okay but not great and with so many options to stay around Seminyak I don't think I will choose the Ramanda Encore again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1718,Bali Trip,30,December 2015,Yes this place is very clean staff are fantastic but getting rooms cleaned every day is near to impossible the cleaners just don't like cleaning rooms!! Break fast needs to be up dated to more Aussie food and not the Asian you don't have a good range and variety for the Aussie taking.. Mushrooms tomatoes different cereals and main menu definitely needs a change.. But resort is beautiful...!!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1719,Very poor service & average location,20,December 2015,"I stayed here for 6 nights with my family.
Housekeeping was poor. Not very thorough and each day our towels were taken but not replaced so we were left with no towels and also no toilet paper. Each day we had to ring reception to ask them for towels and toilet paper, twice, because the first time they would never come.
I accidentally left some clothes in the wardrobe after an early check out and called twice (no answer), so emailed the hotel straight away to notify them. Received no response and when I went to pick the clothes up a few days later they said they didn't have them. They couldn't tell me what happened to them, even though they said their policy is for housekeeping to put guests left behind belongings in lost & found. They did not care at all that this hadn't happened. So someone has obviously done the wrong thing.
Asked for an ice bucket, said I would have to wait one hour because they were too busy.
They ran out of pool towels before lunch, their response was ""too many guests"".
My sisters room was not ready for check in when she arrived at 3pm.
Location is average, out in the sticks a bit.
Positives: pool, breakfast & room is nice enough.
Was so excited to stay here, but after our experience I would not stay here again or recommend to friends or family.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1720,Awful stay,20,January 2016,"We went as honeymooners.. the breakfast is way too good but some food is left uncovered like the bread or fruits.. The room service are terrible they dont clean the room well and sometimes they just skip the room cleaning for a day or two..
Nooo aircondition in the corridors and the lobby as well.. Sometimes the smell is so stincky in the lobby.
The location is sso far from any shopping areas or any sight seeing the hotel is isolated.
Rooms are so small... The view of the room is either on the pool or on a place of grass and houses..",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1721,Weir family stopover BALI,50,December 2015,"Fantastic family accommodation, with bar, restaurant and games room available which was good for teenagers. Gymnasium small but adequate. Massage facilities available at reasonable rates. Breakfast was fabulous! Very friendly and helpful staff. The swimming pool was spectacular.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1722,A pleasant stay,40,December 2015,"This was my second visit to this hotel. I came last time in April 2015 when it was newly open with promotional room rate HKD250. I liked the massage there and 4-star facilities. This Dec 26 I tried another new hotel Savvoya Seminyak but I checked out the next morning since it was horrible. (See my another review). I checked both Booing.com and Ramada Encore websites but they were fully booked since it was peak season.

Fortunately, I rang up the hotel and the staff there was helpful enough to arrange 2 rooms of 3 nights for us. It was life saving, though I ended up paying IDR 959,000 per room per night which was higher than the internet rate. The service was guranteed. Buffet breakfast was good. The massage there was good with reasonable price (though the experience was better in April). Food provided from the hotel was good with reasonable price. We had dinner there every night. There was an all-you-can-eat seafood dinner at IDR 175,000 per head only. We missed it as we just noticed that on our last stay and it was too late . I must try it next time.

Some staff could recognise me though my last visit was already 8 months ago. I will go there again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1723,"Great pool, good location, yucky transport arrangements",40,January 2016,"Pool is decent size with place to relax even though hotel is running at full capacity for NY. Is about less than 10 min by car to seminyak square. Runs a shuttle service but didn't manage to catch it as fully booked.
Hotel has a collaboration with a transport company which charges higher prices than off the street taxis. Prices to same place varies daily. They only allow taxis to drop off and not pick up passengers from hotel so no choice cos is a walk to the main street by foot.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1724,Not bad but also not good,30,January 2016,"I love this place. So comfy
But the service was not good (cant say it was bad either), i need an additional blanket at 7pm, they delivered to my room at 8.15. And also, the card key didnt work properly, an error was occured so it made me wait like 20 minutes in front of my room waiting the roomboy fix the problem.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1725,Horrible hotel .... Don't bother,10,December 2015,"The service at this hotel is appalling. You can't get reception to answer the phone , call a taxi or even clean your room. We have been here for a week and our room is now filthy. We tried stripping the beds our selves so they would at least give us clean sheets and they put them back on the bed. Breakfast is disgusting so we eat out A long way off the beaten track so you have to taxi everywhere or walk Concierge are unhelpful and rude, pool area is very uninviting no pool restaurant or bar service which is what Bali is all about.
Do you research people and leave this disgusting resort off your list !!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1726,Good hotel actually,40,December 2015,"Stay with big family member. Choose Deluxe room as has enough space rather than Superior. The room was just OK. Considering new hotel but start need to do good maintenance at some places.
Located at small road, bit far from main road and place of attraction. Has big pool and the bar will serve till night.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1727,"Affordable, friendly, so,so location",30,December 2015,"Staff were very friendly and helpful. Arranged us a scooter with in minutes for $7 per day. Rooms were clean. Air conditioner excellent. Breakfast was ok. Not much in the way of fresh fruit, but whatever you asked for the staff obliged. The only real gripe I have is the location of the property. Hubby and I hired a scooter so we were fine, but if you had a family or didn't want to take the scooter option, its kind of in the middle of nowhere.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1728,"Ramada Encore Hotel, Seminyak",30,December 2015,The pictures and description of the hotel are all very misleading. My husband and I stayed here for a few days in what was supposed to be a suite but the room was below average with a whole lot of crawling and flying insects. The location of the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. The service in general can and should definitely be improved. We arranged and paid for an extension to our stay the Sunday because our 19 hour flight was only after midnight but we were locked out of our room the previous afternoon at 13:00 and told other guests were coming in. They did offer us another room - which was filthy! No explanation given. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1729,Room is clean and good breakfast. Pool quite large. Helpful hotel staff. Price quite affordable,40,December 2015,Service is quite good with very helpful staff. Room is suitable for family with big bed. Breakfast also has many menu (Indonesian and western). We also like the large swimming pool. Unfortunately access to the hotel through a narrow street. Price also quite affordable with this good quality,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1730,Great start to our honeymoon,40,December 2015,"This is a fantastic start to our holiday is Asia. After a small hiccup at the start because our room wasn't ready, our experience has been excellent.

The staff are very friendly and helpful and are more than happy to guide you in the right direction.

The food at the restaurant is excellent and well priced. Breakfast was included in our stay and there was a fantastic selection to choose from.

Our room was very clean although several bugs managed to find their way in. Our room was cleaned daily which was great to come back to.

The pool is fantastic with plenty of lounges and bean bags to relax on. The pool is super clean and has a bar next to it to grab a cold Bintang.

The hotel is located a bit away from the main part of Seminyak and this did mean that we paid more for the taxi each time. I would highly suggest that you get the taxi from the hotel as we tried to walk to the main road and we were attacked by a very scruffy dog.

Overall a fantastic start to our honeymoon and would highly recommend Ramada Encore.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1731,Very noisy and dirty hotel overall.,20,December 2015,"We had to change room three times until we get a quiet and relatively clean room - that was not cleaned at all, while we where there.
Very noisy, music during meals unappropriate and very loud, could hardly speak to my husband during a meal.
If you get breakfast too late, you can hardly find fresh fruit or something fresh to eat.
The pool is ok and the staff very friendly.
Totally big families oriented.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1732,Wanted to leave,20,December 2015,"I stayed there one night with my family.
The rooms seemed nice and clean at first sight, but then we found a cockroach undo the follow and it turned out not to be the only one.
The pool was very big, but there were also a lot of other tourists.
The breakfast also had a wide variety of food but it was nothing to be proud of.
Wouldn't recommend it though it was a very good price..",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1733,RELAXED ENVIRONMENT,50,December 2015,We found this as one of the best hotels we have stayed at. Very clean/spacious rooms. Staff are very friendly and the kids loved the massive pool.They arranged for airport transfer. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling with a family. The onsite facilities are also really good. The restaurant has a variety of menus and everyone makes you feel so welcome. Gita at the restaurant is an asset to Ramada Encore.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1734,Friendly and relaxing,50,December 2015,Our stay was amazing. The staff always provided friendly assistance and made us feel more than welcome! Got spoilt on one night when our booking for dinner ended up being front row for the fire dance! Thank you to the beautiful lady that booked up our table and made us feel special. Highly recommended hotel!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1735,"brand new, nice pool",40,March 2015,"Room was bright and airy, very clean and we had a nice pool view. I can smell its newness.

1736,A Magical Relaxation,40,December 2015,"My wife and kids arrived 2 days early and I arranged for an airport transfer for them. It was very convenient for my wife as she alone travelled with 3 kids including a 6 year old. Her comment was ""they were really helpful!"". The moment you stepped in at the lobby you will be greeted with a sweet smile and the ever willing to help staff. The short time of checking in settles my grumpy 6 year old girl who needs a bed ASAP. But the moment she saw the pool access room her grumpiness was gone. There are plenty of room to swim in the big pool despite of crowds the hotel holds.On the next morning she went to Bali Agung n Krishna for a shopping spree arranged by the hotel and she was satisfied. When I arrived with my another daughter and two more of my family members we checked into a family room with 3 separate bedrooms. It was very comfortable for all the 6 of us.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1737,Good property to stay at,40,June 2015,"This was a great property to stay at in Seminyak considering the deal we got in the off-season. Although the check-in time takes longer but once in, you will be surprised by their buffet breakfast. Great spread and worth staying at. Also, we liked the pool area, it was quite splendid. The only disadvantage will be that it's not centrally located but they have a shuttle that runs twice a day to Kuta and Seminyak centre.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1738,No customer service or dispute resolution,10,December 2015,"Bad review because its not what we expect for 4 star and what we have experienced at other 4 star in Bali sorry to say. We got in at 11pm our rooms weren't ready, the staff didn't bother either or apologize,(bad customer relation straight off the bat) when we finally got our rooms the rooms were the wrong type we had booked and were dirty, they weren't pool view more like pool glimpse no balcony. The staff were not even bothered at all initially, but did get us into the right rooms by 2am. Maybe the pool is good but when the staff don't care or even apologize its the worst and most disappointing start (Generally the staff are nice). Location is really bad as well, in a dead end area with nothing nearby, so you need transport all the time 50,000 idr to get into Seminyak square 80,000idr into Kuta square, they have only 2 shuttles at 10am and 5pm into Seminyak and Kuta(one bus one trip) but if the traffic is heavy they won't take you to Kuta, on departure the reception tried to tell us they could not book a taxi as the lines(6 Taxi companies they were trying it on) were down and we had to use their transport at an inflated price. Its a budget hotel breakfast at a supposedly 4 star resort, you have to ask for bacon and fruit is limited to one or two types, but not real 4 star like the Marriot Nusa Dua etc.
Pool towels are a Drama, its a card system and doesn't work you can't bring a wet towel to swap with a dry towel with out a spanish inquisition, they expect you to bring back towels at end of day get your card back rather then hand onto them for 2-3 days, really hard when going back to room wet, then you want to then go out.
Back to room description if your voucher says anything to different to their room descriptions watch out some other people in the pool had standard pool view room voucher and were put into rice paddy view rooms as the staff said that they don't have standard pool view rooms so they had to take what was given to them, our booking said a 34sqm balcony room they tried to put us into a lesser pool glimpse room, because our voucher didn't match with their description either, so make sure your voucher gets it right, So all in all if you like 4-5star quality not this one, if you like budget price, this is good value",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1739,Nice hotel,30,December 2015,"Check in was swift, employees were helpful, room was clean and spacious enough, ample of breakfast choices, and there were 2 very comfortable pillows for each bed. The only minus point is that the location of the hotel was a bit far from the main road and attractions, so you have to get a taxi ride if you want to get out from the hotel.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1740,Middle of nowhere,20,December 2015,Very disappointed from the time we pulled into the street so far away from everything considering told it was in the heart of seminyak.Then on arrival the young lady that checked us in was lovely we got to our room 2 single beds so after a long sit in car because the drive couldn't find it we have to move rooms. Then we decided to have shower and the floor all mouldy went to dinner which was nice then went back to room to get ready for bed to find stains all over the bed linen gross stains next morning 1st breakfast absolutely shocking cold no bacon had to wait ages for eggs only good if you are Asian rice fish noodles then to top off the fridge in room not working and sleep was minimal because the room above so loud because no carpet a very disappointing stay but 1 good note was how nice the staff were,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1741,Ramada Encore Hotel Seminyak,40,November 2015,"Good if you are looking for non central hotels. Not so good if you want to be near walking distance from shopping. If budget allows, opt for the room with pool access. Service is not too bad. Breakfast is ok. Try the Murano Spa which is less than 5 mins walk from hotel. Cheap and good. Full body massage about INR155,000 (approx usd12)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1742,would stay here again,40,November 2015,"Really lovely people who work and run this hotel. they were very accommodating. the room was nice and the bed and pillows were very comfy. i found breakfast great and the pool was really pretty. it was really easy to get transport and organise a driver ducky who was fabulous. If i had to pick on things, the air con wasnt on when we arrived so our room was hot and stuffy, which is not great when youve just come off a plane and entered a whole new climate. Also, the pool closes at 8pm which i found to be really early. But like i said, if i had to pick on things.

i would recommend this hotel and i would definitely stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1743,NOT OF RAMADA Hotel Standards !,30,December 2015,"We booked for 5 nights for deluxe room at Encore Ramada Bali , but were very disappointed . The room floor was dirty with hair etc and their housekeeping department is awful . We had cockroaches in our room and toilet. The drainage in the shower was not working. We clicked pictures of the roaches all over (7 of them) and showed to the manager . The manager and staff were courteous and even offered a free spa voucher to make our stay pleasant , however the RAMADA standards were missing .",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1744,"Fantastic, relaxing and peaceful",50,December 2015,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 nights here. The bar staff (especially Reymond) were excellent on our late arrival and organised food and drinks for us. This continued through our stay here.
The pool was beautiful, and we loved having access to it from our room.
The air conditioning was excellent and there were times we even felt cold while we were here!
It was wonderful to be away from the hustle and bustle but only a five minute taxi ride from Seminyak square.
Would definitely stay again, and recommend it to others travelling to Bali.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1745,Get the unit by the pool,40,December 2015,"For what we paid it was value for money . The breakfast variety news improving . The room were pretty spacious .. loved the balcony over looking the pool. But if I was ever gonna stay here again, I would get the ground floor unit overlooking the pool furthest away from the restaurant... best units in the whole place.. the pool is massive... but on a couple of occasions full of noisy bogans. . the hotel is off sunset road, so thee is nothing within walking distance. Which suited us jus fine. We ubered whenever we wanted go out.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1746,Amazing hotel and very friendly staff,40,December 2015,"Amazing hotel, very friendly staff, perfect lagoon pool area. Incredible breakfest.

1747,Great Deals,50,November 2015,"The Hotel location is in the perfect area for leisure and fun in Bali, but with an affordable value I had beyond my expectation.

I really love the room, the hospitality, the lights ambiance, and the pool for sure.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1748,Extremely lovable,40,December 2015,"We travelled to Bali for the first time and were a family of 5 members traveling. The check in was really quick and good and the staff at the reception very helpful and courteous. The breakfast buffet was very good and the staff during breakfast, lunch and dinner were very hospitable and kind people. They would always check in on us to see if everything was okay. The most outstanding care we felt by far especially when we got calls from reception asking if we wish to come down for breakfast or would we like to use the shuttle bus. All in all it was a great experience and their service made it even more memorable for us. Special thanks to staff, Gita and Era for their care and attention. We highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Bali! :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1749,A good experiences and very nice hotel,50,November 2015,"We took taxi from Ngurah Rai International Aiport and We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is located at the end of small road, But the hotel building is big & looks beautiful. We took The Family 3 Bedrooms. The room is clean and nice. Friendly staffs.

The hotel has beautiful swimming pool & large. Breakfast is excellent with lot of choices & cheap.

Two thing that need to improve: the air conditioner need to service. Not so cold.. And they didn't clean up our rooms.
but over all it's great!

Thank You! :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1750,Excellent value. Friendly staff,40,November 2015,My 2 children and I stayed at the Ramada. Breakfast was good. The pool was very child friendly although the operational hours of the pool could've been a little longer. The additional features of a shuttle bus and fire dancer were a nice bonus. Very affordable. Good service. Two minor complaints. It was a little bit off the beaten track so you need to take a taxi to get anywhere. Also the walls between the rooms are thin. If I was in the bathroom I could hear my neighbors.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1751,Value for money!,50,November 2015,"The hotel is new and has an amazing pool, its huge. We had a great time. The staff is very friendly and you are always greeted. Breakfast is also pretty good too. At this price, it will be hard to find a better hotel then this. Seminyak square/nightlight is 5 mins riding on a scooter. Would recommend this hotel to all and will definitely be back here!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1752,Affordable gateway,50,November 2015,"I found this hotel thru Bali gateway website. The hotel is new. Chic, simple, room is nice, breakfast selection is good. However the staffs need to get more training on hospitality manner. They seem annoying and 90% of the staffs did not even bother to greet when there's eye contact with us as a guest. We did not feel welcome. In bahasa we will say ""cuek"". Breakfast is chaos with Chinese tourist group who made really noise and cut your line. The hotel is quite far from the main road, hence suggested to rent private bike or car for easy access to go out to Seminyak, Petitenget or other short distance area. Nice and huge swimming pool. Overall our stay is good minus staffs behaviour and courtesy.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1753,"A budget hotel with reasonable service but, not-so-great location.",30,November 2015,"The Ramada Encore Seminyak is a budget hotel and it's kind of hard to forget that. While it is in Seminyak, the location of the hotel isn't great - which means you are quite dependant on the shuttles (which are infrequent) and cabs (uber works). It isn't possible to walk anywhere to eat / the beach etc. from this hotel.
The service is average and you are unlikely to get any help from housekeeping. But the breakfast spread is quite okay considering what you will probably be paying for your room. Didn't have an issue with cleanliness either.
While the hotel itself is satisfactory, I'd recommend a hotel closer to Seminyak and there are plenty of budget hotels in that locality.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1754,not worth it,10,November 2015,"Would not recommend this place to anyone. Reception staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful. Website states the hotel has regular shuttles to Seminyak between 10 - 5 but this is not true - one day we were told we would have to wait 2 hours for the next shuttle to Seminyak even though the drive takes less then 10 minutes. As the Hotel isn't close to a main road you are reliant on the shuttle or the expensive taxis the hotel can call.

Rooms are filthy and seem to get worse each day. We changed rooms three times and all were dirty. Cups in the room hadn't been cleaned - instead just flipped over for the next guest. Desk in the room was so sticky and there were ants on most surfaces, even had to wear footwear in the shower and i'm unsure if the toilet had ever been cleaned. Fridges are warm so nothing stays cold and air con turns off when you leave your room. We complained about the cleanliness numerous times and nothing was ever done.

I understand this is a cheap hotel but its really not worth the trouble. Only plus was the pool.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1755,"Bad, commercial, bad hospitality",10,November 2015,We enter the hotel at 12pm and find out that we have to wait till 2pm to get a room.. Then u ask them at the same moment while booking to arrange for a bike and they assure to arrange for u.. After an hour when our booking was confirmed u come to know that they cannot arrange a bike. So the hotel is far from the main places as it is in the outskirts. Then as we finish off from the lunch we are asked to pay the money right away and it cannot be sorted when u checkout. So u have to keep ur cards and money with u all the time as if u r roaming in a market. The bathrooms are very small and rooms too. Very few staff. The breakfast place seems to be like a mess with too much crowd noise and long cues. Overall i didnt find it a place for a holiday more of like a business hotel.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1756,Good hotel,40,November 2015,"We had a great time at the encore the grounds are fantastic. At this price point you would be be hard pressed to find a better hotel.a
Rey at the bar is awesome very helpful great service, he will make your bali holiday memorable. Would recommend the encore to all. Breakfast is also pretty good.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1757,Where do i begin....,10,November 2015,"We stayed here in November 2015.
Group of 9 adults and 2 children spread between 5 rooms.
Few things have ruined our stay here but i will start with the main positive: the bar staff were EXCELLENT. Very attentive and great with the kids, kept them entertained and happy and didn't complain when we wanted to stay and drink past the ""closing"" time.
Now for the negatives...

1: Location
This hotel is not walking distance from anything. And not near any main roads.
Fair enough we should have done out research on this. The main problem with this is you need to rely on the hotel's own transport cars which are triple the price of taxis and half as knowledgeable.
And when you ask them to call a taxi they will do it (reluctantly i might add) but expect a price hike as the taxi drivers know they can get away with it from this location.

2: Reception
VERY unorganized. 2 of us tried to change our rooms to upgrade to one with better views. After 2 hours of back and forth we were told it would be cheaper to rebook online and that was what we had to do.
We asked reception to book us a table at a popular restaurant, we were told they had spoken to them and no need to book. We thought that was a bit odd so we asked a second person who said the same thing so we thought they must have rang and it would be ok.
All 11 of us got 3 separate cars to the restaurant only to be turned away as they were fully booked. Not happy at all.

3: Cleaning / housekeeping
The rooms were fairly clean, but not very well upkept. Out bathroom continued to get dirtier and dirtier as we stayed. Eventually i ended up wiping up the bathroom sink with one of the towels.

All in all i dont think I'd ever recommend this place to anyone. Such a shame as the staff seem to work very hard there is just a severe lack of management and organization.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1758,Mixed review,20,November 2015,"We thought we had booked a room with a single and double bed (said so on booking.com receipt). but when we got here they said they dont gave such rooms and would have to pay $25 extra per night. The bar fridges dont get cold at all, so cant keep milk for children cold (muchless water or leftovers or other food). Aircon worked well and nice lighting in room. They kept taking our towels and not replacing w 3 (as we are 3 people) but leaving two. The key cards kept not working. Nice pool, nice buffet and good dinners (lovely satay chicken and thai lychee iced tea).",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1759,"A good experience ""Except""",30,November 2015,"The room was lovely with the pool right outside the door the was a great experience and very relaxing

The complaint I have is that they did not clean our bathroom the whole time we were in the room (4 days)

Also take extra money for the taxi costs extra and a little out of town for shopping",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1760,Ramada Encore Seminyak Hotel,40,November 2015,"The hotel is easy to reach. The staffs are friendly and helpful.

You can enjoy the romantic dinner with live music or you can swim and listening the music.

This is the 3rd times, I stayed in this hotel and will back if I visit Bali again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1761,A mixed experience,20,October 2015,"I stayed here Oct-Nov15 after reading the reviews and booked the upgrade to a pool access room and was very happy with the layout and location. The pool access room we had was great - very private to say it was on the main pool but there was a lack of pool chairs and it was always a battle to get a seat outside your room (which is sort of the point of paying extra for pool access).

The food included in the breakfast was average for this size hotel and the menu for dinner was a bit limited so I was going to give it a miss and eat out but one night the wife was not feeling like going out and we ate in. I have to say I was very impressed. the steak which I wouldn't normally order in Bali was as good as I would any I have had anywhere and the other meals were great as well, pleasantly surprising.

The biggest problem with our stay was room cleaning which was very superficial. Stay a few days and it would be a non-issue but we were there 11 nights and the dirt on the sink just kept building up. I cleaned it myself with the room towels once and then complained one night while going out to dinner. When I returned the sink was still dirty but my towels had been replaced and our bathers had been removed from the room. Complained about 4 times always a different person to see and had one item of the three returned. Kept following up and every time the investigation started again. Followed up for the next two weeks then return to Australia. Phone and emails ignored.

My general impression is stay there if you can get a pool access room, the staff try and be helpful but there is a clear lack in management to ensure anything gets done.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1762,Feed back,50,November 2015,We found the motel very very friendly. Two staff which stood out were Gita and Rey . The massage ladies were lovely. Good was lovely. Really enjoyed the entertainment. Defiantly would go back. The room service was awesome as well. Facilities were maintained well.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1763,Bali trip 2015,40,November 2015,"Our overall hotel staff was great, we would encourage that staff are mindful of those guest with young children in the pool at 7am screaming in the pool two days in a row, that noise travelled through the whole hotel

other than that the staff and accommodation was great, front counter TITA was fantastic very polite and willing to help with anything, we had the volcano issues with our flights and she made us so relaxed organising additional nights

GITA and REY Dinning and Bar made our time there even better, they communicated and laughed with us was so pleasing

Ava the massages I stayed for 10 days and had a massage every day they were fantastic thankyou
until we return
Thankyou

1764,Perfect for a quiet stay,50,November 2015,"This hotel probably would not suit someone looking for party life of Kuta. It is a bit off the track hiding in a labyrinth of small lanes in outback Seminyak. But it is exactly what we wanted. Also beware that Bookings.com have the location completely wrong on their map by about 1 km.

Great value at AU$42 per night we stayed for 7 nights.

Being far from the centre of things is not a problem because the hotel runs a regular free shuttle bus to Seminyak and Kuta. It costs 30,000 to catch taxi back to hotel from seminyak.

As mentioned already in posts, the beds are amazing. Huge and super comfortable. Rooms were imaculate. Gardens are manicured. Pool is huge, and spotlessly clean (they even publish daily pH and Chlorine levels on a board)!

Drinks are reasonable prices, but rooms have bar fridge, so buy your own Bintang and enjoy. As with most Balinese hotels, they supply two bottles of complimentary drinking water each day.

As in all Asian hotels we have visited, room lighting is dingy and dull, but there are plenty of lights (why don't they have just have two or three decent wattage lights, rather than a dozen useless low watt globes)?

Shower is excellent; very hot and strong, without the odd sewage smell you get in many cheap Asian hotel bathrooms.

Possibly one of the best things about this hotel is the included buffet breakfast. Particularly the Indonesian food was excellent. No need for lunch after nasi gorang, ayam curry, fried egg, mei go rang, juice, fruit and pastries !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1765,"Huge Hotel, Far From Everything",20,October 2015,"We thought we could include the cost of the airport shuttle on our room bill.... we thought we had booked a ""superior"" room... we thought we were only a 5-mintue walk from the beach.... we thought the free shuttle busses ran often....

This HUGE hotel complex (with a very pretty pool) may be well run, but guests feel more like numbers than guests. Breakfast was very good, everything was very clean, but I wouldn't come back to this hotel. I prefer something smaller and closer to the center. If you just want to hang out at a pool, this is the place for you.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1766,Love the Pool,50,November 2015,"Great place to stay, friendly staff, clean and variety of food.
Even bit far from main street but they have shuttle bus and bicycle for rent.
They have big and clean swimming pool, pool for kids too.
Love it!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1767,"Excellent value, great facilities, lovely staff",50,November 2015,"Just checked in today after a terrible experience at a neighbouring hotel. Without mentioning names,the previous hotel was a similar price and totally incomparable to the Ramada.
An excellent experience from the second we walked into the hotel as after explaining our bad experience we were personally showed around the hotel to view potential rooms. We then have had an excellent lunch and the pool area is beautiful.
Really hard to expect anymore for such a well priced hotel. Rooms are big, comfortable and well air conditioned. Large balcony over looking the pool area.
Looking forward to enjoying 2 weeks here. Location is a few kilometres from the beach but there is a free shuttle service and extremely cheap and easy to get a taxi. Top tip, always ensure the taxi has a running meter.
Thank you

1768,Great Stay,40,September 2015,"Stayed here for two weeks and had a great time with my partner. Had a room that opened onto the pool which was the best location. Breakfast was a good selection and was included in the room rate. Dinner and lunch would recommend going elsewhere though,as not much selection and close enough to some of the best restaurants. Would recommend a stay here for all ages. Near to all attractions in Seminyak and Ramada has good and competitively priced taxi servies. Very new resort, would happily stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1769,A santuary,50,November 2015,"I have seen many tourist attractions in my travels. After I felt I had seen enough of Bali, I chose this out of the way place. It was very tranquil and relaxing. The rooms are American sized, and unfortunately or fortunately, so was the food. Saw too much wasted food for my liking at the breakfast buffet. The property has a nice pool which was where I soent much of my days. It is rather far from EVERYTHING. For me, it was the perfect setting because I like out of the way places and I like the LACK of hustle.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1770,Quiet hotel away from Seminyak centre,40,August 2015,"If you want a modern hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak yet close enough to visit the restaurants or beach then this hotel is great. Great for value, great for amenities as well as situation. It is set back from Sunset Road but still only a short 10 minute walk from convenience stores, shops, cafes and small restaurants. The hotel offers a great buffet breakfast and their A La Carte menu for lunch and dinner were most adequate. The swimming pool and surrounding gardens were relaxing and refreshing also. We stayed for 6 nights here before moving to a villa in Seminyak which was only a 10 minute drive or 30 minute walk away for those not afraid of a little exercise.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1771,Hit and Miss-- some rooms are better than others,40,November 2015,"Stayed for a short getaway at the Ramada Encore... We finally chose the Ramada Encore because it's new and we wanted to try out the 'Encore' branding.
Location:
As mentioned, the location may not be the most convenient as it is located away from the main stretch of Sunset Road ( Sunset Point) but getting around was not an issue due to the easy accessibility to taxis. ( I prefer using the bluebirds as despite the minimum 30K rupiah charge they seem safer and still work out to be cheaper especially for longer distances!)

Room and Pool:
We had a ground floor room that opened out to the pool area. The pool and lagoon area was landscaped very nicely. As for the room, it was comfortable but the first room we were assigned had sign of wear and tear hardly befitting of a newly opened hotel. That aside the major concern I had was the shower stall itself had very poor drainage resulting in constant water pooling and subsequent the growth of mould. The photographs/pictures on the wall also had remnants of water stains which proved disconcerting given that this is a new hotel after all. We were subsequently moved next door to a similar class room when the air con developed technical problems. This room appeared newer and did not suffer from water drainage issues mentioned above. Overall this room also felt fresher.

Internet:
Complimentary wifi was available throughout the resort. That was great. Some rooms/areas had better connectivity. In the first room we were constantly locked out of the network and the speed of the network was slow. But in the second room the speed of the Internet was much faster and more reliable!

I would love to give the Ramada Encore 5 stars for its good value and quick responsive staff but I am taking away one start for the mould and overall wear in some of the rooms. It is a comfortable resort to be in if you are given one of the 'newer' rooms.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1772,"Value for money,a relativily new hotel",40,October 2015,"On this trip to Bali,hubby & I decided to check a couple of hotels out to stay for future trips,we stayed at the Ramada Encore for 3 days (wish we had of booked here for the remaining days,not the Champlung Mas Legian)Brilliant prices & deals are a great option on this hotel,I booked on the travel section of Groupon & at the time they had a great price on the Ramada Encore,they were offering a further 15% off too,I think for three nights,it ended up around $125 after discount.It is a bit further out from the main strip of Seminyak, but with the shuttle service ($4) or the Blue Bird Taxis,(around $2-$3,depending on time of day)it wasn't an issue.Personally,I liked the fact it was a bit more remote,away from the hustle & bustle of the main streets/shopping area.The Pools are great & surrounded by a tropical setting,a massive size pool (kind of three in one)The buffet breakfast catered for everyone,from waffles/pancakes,to eggs how you want them,cereals,Asian food,Western food,heaps of variety to chose from,they even have a pizza deal,from memory they were 3 for $10 & they were made in front of you in a pizza oven,they were awesome.Hubby & I ate a couple of times at the hotel & their meals are delicious & their prices are very reasonable,they also have 24 hr room service,could not fault any of the staff,they were very eager to make your stay a beautiful enjoyable memory,the rooms are spacious & the beds are super comfortable,we got the best sleep! The Ramada Encore was completed in Dec 2014 & is a beautiful hotel to stay at,so if anyone has any complaints,what's that old saying? ''There's always one'' lol WILL definitely be returning to the Ramada Encore in Seminyak! Facilities are great,they even have a billiard table & one of those soccer games table,they also have a fitness center, kids club, massage, outdoor pool, pool (kids) spa",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1773,You simply can't beat this hotel for value for money - It's easily the best.,50,November 2015,"We have been staying here the past 11 nights, delayed by ash cloud flight cancellations. For the price, you cannot beat it. It is a bit further away from the main strip of Seminyak, but with the shuttle service & plenty of cheap meter taxis, it is not an issue. Even find it an advantage to be away from the shops & hustle bustle. The pool is great & we have been spending most days at the resort. Resort prices are reasonable. Buffet breakfast is amazing for the price. I'm surprised that anyone would complain about it. It IS varied and food is tasty. Rooms are spacious, beds & pillows are SO comfortable. Many patrons have gone to other resorts & returned to the Ramada Encore during our stay.. because in this price category, nothing else compares. Will definitely be back. Very affordable and enjoyable. All staff are so lovely and eager to please. Don't bother looking any further if you don't want to spend big bucks. We just love it here!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1774,Made our vacation memorable!!,50,October 2015,"We were a group of 4, on our first international trip. We randomly chose Ramada... but the stay there was simply awesome. The rooms are clean, well supplied and maintained. The staff are very hospitable, friendly and patient. The restaurant has a very good variety of food and we loved the Pizzas. Their daily shuttle service to Seminyak Square / Beachwalk is worth mentioning.
Tita, at the frontdesk is very helpful, starting from location recommendations to helping us with our transport. Dewi, our waitress was a gem.
We were so happy with this place, that we cancelled our booking in north Bali and decided to extend our stay in Ramada. Definitely worth the bucks you pay.
Good work Tita and Team, hope to visit Bali again!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1775,Very nice hotel with large rooms and big balcony,50,October 2015,Located in a quieter part of Seminyak shops are just a little to far to walk to but it didn't matter because the hotel was such good value. Rooms are big and bright. Pool is fantastic and the buffet breakfast the best I've had. I didn't eat other meals there but friends who did said they were average. Except for the frustrating amount of traffic getting into Seminyak it was a totally enjoyable experience.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

I would say that the hotel is value for money with excellent delivery.

will come back and recommend to family and friends.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1778,Excellent place!,50,October 2015,Great value. Big size rooms. Amazing swimming pool. Staff v friendly. Breakfast buffet is very good. Everyday something different to eat. The best member of staff is DEWI. SHE IS VERY HELPFUL. I was really enjoyed stay here. Thanks a lots for everything.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1779,Such good value!!!,50,October 2015,"Absolutely blown away by this place considering how cheap it is!!! My friends paid £10 each per night for a twin room, and my fiancé and I paid about £5 more per night for a deluxe room with balcony & pool view and both rooms were fab. I'd say it's worth paying a bit extra for the deluxe because you get so much space! Sofa/dressing area/huge bed/lovely furniture on the balcony. Room cleaned everyday, great room service, really good shower compared to some in Bali, good aircon too.
The pool area is amazing. Plenty of sunbeds and the sun gets the pool most of the day.
Breakfast was great too - lots of choice. The food from the restaurant the rest of the time was ok - only had a couple of things because it's quite pricey and was happy but nothing special - I think it depends what you get.
Staff were all very nice, welcoming and helpful.
No complaints except that it's a bit of a walk to seminyak square etc... However the hotel put shuttle services on and taxis are really cheap! So it's not really a complaint ;-) Would definitely stay again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1780,Nice clean hotel with big pool and gym,50,October 2015,Very nice hotel with friendly staffs. Big pool...decent Gym and small kids club. Pool access rooms are best to relax or hamg out. Having beer and pizza while the kids in the shallow pool ( along the side where they put deck chair) or in the deep pool (1.5m) max length 50m pool. The pizza was great with affordable price. The breakfast is more than i expect. I believe they cook the bacon separately (need to request too at eg station) 30 minutes away from beach (on foot). Definitly goong back soon,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1781,You could not find more friendly and helpful staff!,40,October 2015,"This out of the way, very reasonably priced hotel is located in Seminyak but a long way from the beach. However, if you just need a bed for a few nights it is within easy reach of some great restaurants on Sunset Rd and those in the area of JL. Kunti 1, is quiet and the service is great.
They also have a restaurant on site which is open all day as is the pool side bar. An excellent buffet breakfast is included in the room price. We ate in twice fro dinner. A la carte one night which we enjoyed without being blown away. Steer clear of the wine list though. Our fist selection on two occasions wasn't available and what we had as a second choice on each occasion wasn't great. The second night we had the BBQ. All you can eat for IDR175K which they put on for all comers on Saturday nights. This was one of our most expensive meals in our ten nights in Bali and probably the most disappointing. That, to be fair, is because they have a lot to live up to with other restaurants in the area providing a more desirable feast for half the price. But you do have to venture out for this.
The enormous pool is lovely, though day beds can be in short supply at peak times. These few tiny reservations do not detract from the overall experience though. And the price is right!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1782,Shambles,20,October 2015,"What a shambles of a ""4 star"" hotel. Firstly arrive at hotel, didn't have our reservation. Finally found our reservations but our room wasn't ready (it was about 6pm when we checked in, would of expected room to be ready) waited for a while, still not ready. Went for dinner in the restaurant very nice, lovely staff. Go back to see if room ready still not. Another 10/15 minute wait room finally ready, did tell them it was our honeymoon, so was hoping maybe the wait for something special in our room. No such luck. Reception staff not brilliant took money off our card for deposit so we can put meals and drinks on tab but didn't work properly so spent the remainder 3 days of our stay trying to get our money back long story short very annoying and nobody really new what they was up to. Had a massage was lovely but a little of a weird set up just in a converted bedroom on the forth floor. Pool area nice shame no sunbeds out of the water. Room 1140 very noisy with wildlife outside some cricket going on all night! Location of the hotel out of town need taxi or long walk taxi about 20idr so about £1 which isn't bad at all! No issues with room other than the noise and a gecko in our room one night.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1783,"""Paradise in Paradise @ a great price""",50,October 2015,"""We had a marvelous stay in Seminyak at the Ramada Encore Hotel. Wonderful interiors, very good service. To make our stay even more pleasant, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Starting with the ease of checking in to recommending a restaurant for supper that was very nice and the food was delicious, must recommend the hotel's Restaurant for the Crispy Duck and Pizza and some exquisite mocktails. Very reasonably priced too for a luxury hotel. The stay was so good, that we cancelled on our stay at Candidasa to come back to the Encore.......... A special mention - Tita, from the front office was so warm welcoming and helped us in exploring local places along with adding more must see places to the itinerary. Tita was so good to us, not only to us but also to all the people who come there. A very great host. She is an asset to the hotel........
Dewi, our waitress was so polite and humble, and helped us in trying the local cuisine.""",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1784,Good value. Beautiful pool.,40,August 2015,"I stayed one night here in a pool view room. The balcony over looking the pool was lovely, the room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. The rooms could be a little loud depending on what side of the building you're on. Breakfast was good. Check in was super slow and time consuming, but staff were otherwise helpful!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1785,Good laguna and breakfast by the pool,50,October 2015,"We stay here for 2 nights and it was great.
(+) Great laguna and pool for sun bathing and swimming
(+) Breakfast is good with a lot of choices
(+) Friendly staffs
(+) Cozy lobby

(-) Room does not have soundproof, often hear noises from outside, quite bothering especially at night.
(-) Shower area at bathroom does not have curtains, cause the bathroom a little bit slippery.

Overall everything is good. I love here and definitely will come back.
Thank you.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1786,Great hotel at good pricepoint.,40,October 2015,"The hotel is lovely. Big pool, large rooms, lovely staff. A good 4 star hotel at great value. I stopped here for 23 nights and physically visited other hotels at the same price point in the area - they didn't really compare. Very happy to of stayed here for this this amount of time. Free Wifi was available everywhere and worked well. It only slowed slightly when the hotel was busier but did work all the time. I took advantage of a massage which was professionally carried out and very relaxing. The breakfast consists of cereals, choice of breads, pastries, pancakes and waffles with jams and sauces. There was also a hot selection including omelettes made to order but I didn't partake in the hot buffet. Looked good. Meals available throughout the day, good food, great service. Special thanks for Dewi and Era for making it a pleasant experience every time. Maintenance at the hotel is good, its only been open 11 months and maintenance was going on all the time. The only thing to consider is location, the hotel is about 30 minute walk from Seminyak. Small convenience store within 8 minute walk. If you hire a car, scooter, distance is no problem. Taxis are available and are cheap. Thanks to everyone - missing you already.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1787,Super friendly and nice,50,October 2015,"Super nice hotel. The staff is incredibly helpful and nice. They will drop whatever they are doing at anytime to help you with anything you need.

The pool is also spectacular. They have a gym and you can get a massage on site as well.

The included free breakfast was some of the best food of our trip.

It's a 5 min cab ride from Seminyak square.

Our king size bed was super comfortable.

The food and drinks at the onsite restaurant are great and super cheap.

Big fan of this place.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1788,Great Hotel,40,October 2015,"I stayed for 3 nights. The hotel pick me up at the airport even tho it's 2 a.m. the rooms so nice, the pool so warming, and the breakfast was so amazing. I'd like to be back to this hotel for next trip.
one thing that mess me up is their room service for clean up the room, it's so late.
but over all it's great!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1789,excellent stay,40,September 2015,good room great breakfast good pool-friendly staff and can walk into seminyak shopping strips -hired a bike for the stay which made life easier. some good restaurants in the area. will return again for next trip,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1790,Value for money in seminyak- excellent hotel,50,October 2015,I stayed here for 6 nights- the hotel arranged a driver to collect me at the airport and pick up went smoothly. The rooms are a good size- I had a pool view with a lovely sunny balcony. There isn't a bath- just a shower but all is well maintained and clean. The pool is beautiful and never got busy- the loungers in the water are a nice touch and the pool is very clean. I think in peak season they may need to get more sun loungers but this time of year there wasn't any problem. The sun is on the pool from 8:30-3:30. Breakfast was also way better than expected with friendly staff at egg and waffle stations. Plenty of choice and catered to both western and Asian tastes. Room service was efficient and all the food was great and the cocktails at the bar too were well made. They have various buffet nights and a singer some nights. Location wise - inland from seminyak was no problem as there are a fleet of drivers on hand to drive you to seminyak centre- sometimes it took 5 mins other times 15 depending on traffic.wifi was excellent. It's a peaceful haven but still close to the best shopping and restaurants. Would stay again for sure as the value for money was excellent.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1791,We'll be back!,40,September 2015,"First trip to Bali for a family wedding and stayed here. Hotel was fantastic and had everything you need. Lovely room overlooking the lagoon, very comfy bed, daily buffet breakfast was great (even did baked beans on request!), good food at the restaurant and all the staff were extremely welcoming especially the waiting staff and great bar staff Ray, Made and Wayan - was such a pleasure meeting you all, thank you for making our stay so great 😊 we will definitely be back :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1792,"Awesome place, friendly staff",40,October 2015,"Loved the stay! Clean rooms, exceptional customer service, fantastic breakfast, lovely pool and vibe in the hotel. Good location. Hotel helped organised scooter rent as well. Overall really enjoyed the place. No complaints. Hotel also has entertainment with fire dancing and Balinese dancers on some nights.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1793,Nice hotel although a bit remote,40,October 2015,"A very nice hotel, with friendly staff and great swimming pool/facilities. The main criticism is that is it a bit isolated from other eating/entertainment venues. If you want peace and quiet from the tourism crowd it is ideal, but after a day of exploring you are restricted to eating from its relatively limited hotel menu/banquet or going externally which is at least a 15 minute walk (between 30 minutes to an hour by the hotel shuttle depending on traffic)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1794,Quite Amazed,40,October 2015,"First time I was entered the hotel's lobby, I already felt amazed.
Welcome drink is free flow, even without refreshment towel. The check in registration only took few minutes ( yeeeayy ). The very nice bellboy lead us to our 03 BR Family pool view Room, and there we were amazed with the room and the view, we were booked for 03 BR family lagoon room but because the room not ready yet, they put us on 03 BR family pool view for around one hour. But that's ok. The foods are great, but they took a while to serve, especially for room service.
The lagoon pool is amazing.. suggestion, please bring anti mosquito if you stay in lagoon room because you will often open the door, and mosquitos can enter the room and they bite hard.. trust me, so hard.
No shower cap in bathrooms.. why? but they provided shaving kit that very rare in other hotels. Well.. average for all is 8, will stay there for another time for sure.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1795,Beautiful hotel. Dodgy scooter renter,50,September 2015,"Hotel was amazing. Really relaxing to lay by the pool and beautiful surroundings. Is abit out of the 'city' but for us we enjoyed that after staying in kuta and there was a free shuttle every hour to whever you wanted. If you are going to rent a scooter dont do it through the hotel, go somewhere in town to rent it. Its cheaper and the guy tryed to say 'we lost his registration and owed him $50AUD' when we never even saw the reigstration or touched it. The scooter also had no left mirror and the speedo didnt work. However over all great hotel!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1796,"Not as good as it used to, but still okay.",30,September 2015,"This is our second time here. The swimming pool and their food are as good as the last time we were there last March. The staffs are friendly and nice. We are just a bit disappointed with the way they clean the room. We stayed there for 13 days; for the first 6 days we stayed there, they didn't change our sheet and bed cover. And they made up our bed sloppily (see picture). And on top of that the pillow smelled musty. We complained regarding the matter to the receptionist, and then it got better afterwards. They supposed to have the 'change bed sheet' card for the guest to put on the bed, if the guest want their sheet to be changed, alas that card is nowhere to be seen. Not until 2 days before we checked out, suddenly the card appeared :). Very strange indeed.
Oh and one more thing, the wifi in our room is barely exist. I don't know whether we will be coming back again for the 3rd time, we'll see.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1797,Oase in Bali,40,September 2015,"Located in Seminyak Bali, Ramada Encore provides a little oase in the crowded tourism area. Just some minutes from the main Sunset Road and Seminyak or Legian, it's calm neighbourhood really stimulates the essence of holiday.
Room is spacious enough with good facilities, covered with fast wifi connection and friendly staffs.
You will love the pool area, wide with tunnel to connect 2 area. Spacious car park in front hotels is spacious with some friendly securities.
They also served early breakfast if you want to check out early morming to catch your flight.
You can rent bicycle to explore the neighbourhood, it's even cheaper than the vendor outside.
When we visited, there was an small private wedding dinner, and the staffs distracted by.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1798,travelled with a group for a wedding,40,September 2015,"room was clean and functional loved the fact that I could walk out onto my veranda and straight into the pool. Staff were very helpful and the wedding reception was just amazing. The location was not the best but easy to get around as there were always cars waiting to take you anywhere .Ronny was an excellent driver would recommend him to anyone.The best thing were the amazing pillows best sleep ever. the staff in the bar, dining area were disappointing as tables were left with not being cleaned and had to clean up glasses etc as no one collected them as they were being replaced needed more bar staff",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1799,Great Hotel,40,September 2015,"We stayed here for a week, the staff for unbelievably friendly and remembered our names which was great! they always wanted to help, they even started singing with the live music :) the food was delicious from the restaurant, the rooms were clean and the pool area was fantastic good value for money for accommodation. although it is a little out from the beach it was still easy to get around and hire scooters etc. would 100% recommend to people. we will be back :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1800,Awesome.,40,September 2015,"I recently stayed here for three nights and pleased to say I enjoyed it, comfy beds, friendly staff and great room options and friendly staff! No problem to get anywhere you need to go as there are always cheap taxis and close by shops. Maybe the drink prices could lower a tiny bit being it Bali and all but the price for the rooms are worth it if say!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The buffet breakfast was a great way to start the day and the pool was beautiful. Being our first stop to our 2 week holiday The staff were very approachable and made us feel very welcome to being in bali with all the staff greeting us every time we saw them which was very warming to us.
The distance to town was quite a lot further then we had anticipated which bothered us some times but we managed to work around it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1803,Great value. Lovely pool!,50,September 2015,"This hotel offers great value for money. For the price, I think its a great choice. I stayed here the day before I flew and really enjoyed relaxing by the beautiful pool! The staff are super friendly and helpful and the room has good facilities. The breakfast was OK, I especially enjoyed the lovely fresh fruit.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1804,2 nights stay,40,September 2015,"Good value for the money. The rooms are correct and clean and the pool is big and nice. Good location, close to center but away from noise and crow. Staff is very friendly.
One negative side would be that cleaners are very loud during the mornings, slamming doors and hitting doors while swiping the floors, etc...
I don't think I would come back to seminyak but if I do, I would repeat the hotel for sure.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1805,Fabulous Hotel,50,September 2015,"Just returned from a fantastic holiday here - we had a Lagoon access room which was excellent! Large room with fridge, kettle etc the best pillows ever!!!!!

Staff is very friendly...N The main aim to stay here is spa...It is very clean and smooth spa unlike those on road side near kuta.. rates are damn cheap (for Indians n westerns atleast) ....visited 3 times spa in 3 days visit..Even my wife enjoyed a lot...My opinon is stay 3 nights in nusa dua, n 3 in semniyak....6 days must for Bali",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1808,Ramada Encore Seminyak,40,September 2015,"We stayed for 8 nights in innterconnecting delux rooms, they were comfortable, with good facilities.
The breakfast had many options, however felt geared towards the asian market.
The pool was huge with shallow and deep sections which was great with young swimmers! There were too many lounges in the water with not enough dry!
Location was a taxi ride away from Seminyak...the hotel charged 40,000IDR for this service, however cheekily the drivers often didn't have change!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1809,Enjoyment at Ramada,50,September 2015,"Ramada Encore was a great place to stay with friendly staff, good service and food.
Rooms were lovely and very clean.
The highlights were the wonderful Breakfast Buffet with it's large assortments of food, fruit and pastries and lazing around the swimmingpool drinking the freshest fruit smoothies. All the young staff were so friendly and helpful.
The only drawback was that it was a little to far away from shops and restaurants.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1810,Away from the hustle & bustle,50,September 2015,"Encore to all the staff 😊
Would love to see such service repeated everywhere, thank you everyone! Food was pretty excellent, wish we were staying longer so could sample more! Bed was sooo sooo comfortable. Wifi excellent. TV channels ok. Rooms very nice, love the balcony access to the pool, such a great feature! Overall, so nice to 'come home to' ☺ Will definitely come again!

PS. May be something about the towels could be improved, I know they are clean and laundered, but some are stained and they don't smell very fresh. Oh, may want to check out the showerhead, it could break anytime.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1811,best hotel in bali,50,September 2015,had an awesome time staff incredibly friendly willing to go the extra mile. beautiful rooms clean and tidy . reymond the best barman in bali . loved every minute highly recomended prices very reasonable five stars,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1812,Service was not that good,30,September 2015,"The channels in the room was unstable. Especially channel 43 and 44.
When we called the technician, he came to our room and changed the tv. but still the same problem persist. He said he cant do anything about it.

The room service waiters, Now when you order feew bottles of beer and drinking alone, would you prefer ALL of your bottles opened at a time or what??

When i told him to leave the bottle opener he said it was some company policies one opener per waiter??

Wait!! DO I LOOK MLIKE I CARE ABOUT UR POLICIES???

But I like to highlight on MS. Dewi and Mr. Anan from the restaurant. There were good in terms of serving us.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1813,For hospitality apprentices,20,September 2015,"I understand you get what you pay for, and each of our tastes and budgets are different, but if you're timings right you can stay at some very good places at good prices... but The Ramada Encore fell below par for me on most areas. Unless you are sensible enough to have a deal with a driver, motorcycle or tour operator you will almost no doubt have difficulty explaining where the hotel is at least once. It's fairly new, out the back of Seminyak, in Badung, and proved to be very hard for a number of taxi and other drivers to find, even the die hard local driver and GPS gurus. To the menu - Just not good enough. I'm an average Aussie and found that the
$$ priced meals were almost kids size and had to sometimes order 2 meals even then you found you were eating them only because you'd otherwise go hungry. The steak size and presentation was disgraceful. After 5 days the steadfast all day menu will drive you nuts. Breakfast buffet by the pool- open and breezy but one only has to look around and see the full load would be 60/70% Caucasians yet the food was 60/70% Asian and very little variety from day to day. You will most likely queue for eggs, toast, and the non commercial espresso machines. The staff are polite and friendly but almost all of them you'd swear we're kids on their apprenticeships. Know one really knows a lot about what's going on, but I guess the kids have to start somewhere and learn. In short it's not a bad place, just somewhat immature in its product/management/system cycle... and it's out of the way location must be factored in. If you really don't want beach, shopping, bali's worsening traffic, or trouble with transport, you can always lounge around the peaceful pool with a good vantage point of that famous ""bali breeze"" all day long !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1814,Too far from anything,20,September 2015,"Hotel is miles away from anywhere. Too far to walk to restaurants or shopping. Hotel itself is good. Staff are wonderful, especially Dewi. However we booked a ""garden"" view room but got a view of a dirty field. Depressing when so many other rooms were empty. Would not recommend at all.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1815,Lovely relaxed vibe!,50,September 2015,"Have just stayed for 9 nights with my husband . Could fault anything really. Staff are amazing !!!!! Pool beautiful and great food! Breaky was good but maybe some cream or Icecream for the pancakes and waffles and vegemite for my toast. But such a little thing. Taxis cheap and easy. They offer a cheap drop off to airport. Clean relaxing and well priced , we will be back!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1816,Elevator chime is annoying.,40,September 2015,"The breakfast is very nice. The rooms are clean. Food and drink prices are not a good value, it is convenient but food is only fair. Other guests often talk loudly while in the hallways or while waiting for the elevator. Don't misplace your ""Pool Tag"" or you are fined about $Au15.00 when checking out. Television reception is very poor.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1817,good value for money,40,September 2015,"huge shallow pools is the main attraction of this hotel. kids can swim freely without parent guard them all the time. beside that the breakfast choice of pancakes/waffles offer all sort of kids favourite topping like nutella, caramel, honey, etc.
cons : wifi in room somehow doesnt work.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1818,Dirty and loud,20,September 2015,Shower was mouldy. Band played extremely loud we could clearly hear inside our room at 10pm. That's not really late but most flights leaving bali are early hours and planned on a couple hours sleep before flight also you can hear everyone near you opening and closing doors moving around in their rooms.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1819,Good value for money,40,September 2015,"Visited two weeks in deluxe room. Overall good hotel with a stunning pool! Room was nice and spacious, although could be cleaned better (specifically the bathroom).
2 choices in breakfast: Western and Asian. Asian breakfast had lots to choose from, but options to cover your toast with on the western breakfast was a bit limited. Staff is very friendly, as almost all people in Bali, although staff sometimes comes across slightly passive.

Concluding: good hotel, great value for money, very competitevely priced!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1820,Holiday,50,September 2015,"Excellent room, big and clean. Very good service and breakfast. the price is very reasonable. The hotel has a very nice ambiance. Very helpful and nice staff.

1821,great hotel,40,August 2015,"This a good four star hotel, situated outside the town, but only a ten minute (traffic depending) cab ride from the centre of Seminyak. The facilities are excellent and the staff are friendly. The buffet breakfast was one of the best we have had, but surprisingly the buffet dinner we went to one night was disappointing",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1822,cannot fault this hotel,50,August 2015,"The hotel is not full of young loud tourist i enjoyed a 2 week peaceful stay here, breakfast was nice and the staff were exceptional every member greets you every time they see you and are happy to do anything for you. it is not as far away as everyone makes out they offer a free shuttle but taxis are so cheap and you can haggle them to even cheaper! we ended up with an excellent driver called Wayan Blacky if you ask for him at the hotel they will call him for you. Everything was clean and great value for money.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1823,Second Visit,50,August 2015,"This time I stayed in a pool view room with a balcony. So nice to sit and relax and read on. Breakfast had ample selection - my sister in law cannot eat grains or dairy and still did not go hungry. Eggs at the egg station were done nicely.
Pool is a lovely temperature and very clean. Comfortable walk to Sunset Road and about the same distance again to the start of Jalan Basangkaya which leads into Seminyak. In terms of value for money - you cant beat it. $60 for 2 including breakfast and shuttle service. If you want to get away more frequently than the shuttle, ask the concierge to dial for a Bluebird cab and you will get into Seminyak for between $1.50 and $3.00 (some Bluebird driver's will ask for the minimum charge of 30,000rp, others don't). Great hotel if you are looking for something new, clean and cheap. The beautiful pool taking centre stage is a highlight.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1824,Young tourists hotel!,30,September 2015,"Hotel seems to be packed with young tourists. I don't expect this. You could hear them yelling, chatting and shouting at the hotel corridor (surprisingly not in their room) especially at night! Reminds me during my students time at the students accommodation. If you looking for a place that is at least decent distance from hotel to nightlife and very CHEAP price, this is the hotel. But for mature couple who seek for quietness and relaxation I don't recommend this hotel. It sort of more to 'hostel' guests. I purposely booked the superior room which is away from the pool and the noise from crowded people, but was still VERY noisy. Luckily I always travel with my earplug, once you plug in it was under control, but again the noise from other guests is still a nuisance for me especially if it starts late at night and end at 4/5 a.m. You could still hear the door banging again and again. Room is OK for 2 of us, there have wide window that you could see the paddy field view from your room. The staffs are very helpful, very very friendly and comforting. Pool is awesome. Cleanliness at the room not really satisfying but can be improved. Breakfast is very good, with lots of variety everyday, always pack with people but the staffs really know how to manage them. Thanks for having us.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1825,Poor loacation,40,September 2015,"Decent breakfast, room are good and clean. one pool.
Location is too far, away from all happening places. not enough free shuttle service provided by hotel.

1826,"Amazing pool area, quiet, perfect for a romantic get away",40,August 2015,"My husband and I have just come back from a week at Ramada Encore Bali Seminyak. We absolutely loved the pool area. The peaceful location of the hotel was great. You have to get a taxi everywhere but it doesn't cost much and the hotel provides 2 shuttles a day to Seminyak and Kuta. We used this facility a few times with Made our driver and it was great. 10am in the morning (time to rise and have breaky) and again at 5pm, just in time to go out for dinner - perfect :) We both had massages at the resort and I highly recommend them, very professional and good. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed with the food at this hotel, I didn't find the quality fantastic but it was OK. I am a little fussy though. The coffee was average too but OK. My biggest downfall with this hotel was on the last two days of our trip, we had smoke coming into our room each morning as they burn off regularly over there. I actually felt a little ill, but once the wind/breeze came in, it blew away. Other than that I do recommend this hotel, especially for a peaceful holiday without the traffic noise. The room was lovely, clean, great view overlooking the pool.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1827,Bali with Friends,40,August 2015,"Motel amenities were great...pool is excellent
WiFi slow, but it is Bali!!

Nice bar to sit down for a drink and small but delicious food menu from the hotel's restaurant. 30-45 minutes ride from airport (150-250k IR). About 15-25 minutes walk to seminyak beach / seminyak square or 10 minutes taxi (50-100k IR) depending on traffic.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1829,Nice place to stay,40,August 2015,"Bed & pillows the best I have ever slept on! Very clean and great pool. However, breakfast was lacking but you still wouldn't go hungry, just I have had better! Too far to really walk anywhere, but taxis are cheap so not really a problem. The staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble. Fantastic pizzas.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1830,Nice complex but too far to walk to things,30,August 2015,"Staff were average and quite slow, rooms were good and spacious. nowhere near enough pool chairs and watch for the towel nazi! The towel system doesn't work you are required to hand a card to the staff for your towel and then return and collect your card each day but there was lots of confusion and I never got the same card back. Getting anywhere from the hotel requires transport as there are no shops/restraunts nearby.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1831,fantastic stay.,40,August 2015,"Last minute booking (2 days out) and so glad we chose this hotel! Brand new and fantastic rooms. Pillows to die for. Staff are still learning the ropes and service was a little slow at times but as usual, the friendliness was overwhelming. Food was reasonably priced and really different. Kids were spoiled with love from the staff and breakfast was good for a smallish hotel. The pools are insane! Location is reasonable but don't walk around the lanes at night as bag snatches are at large. Still takes an hour to get to Rumours etc. at 5 pm or Kuta or galleria shopping centre at 10 am. But that's Bali traffic these days. Massages were inexpensive for a hotel too and mine was lovely. They are trying hard with the wine..... Plaga cab sav would be a good investment. Highly recommend a stay here. We will be back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1832,Very peaceful Hotel,30,August 2015,We stayed with my family for 2 weeks at ramada encore the pool is amazing and the room was nice and clean with the pool view.all the staff very friendly the only one staff name Ayunda or Yunda she working in restaurant not really nice and not friendly at all..,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1833,"Very Nice hotel a bit far from any where to walk to, staff very good",50,August 2015,"Our room was nice, clean & quiet with a pool view. Unfortunately the pool was green like a pond for the 7 days we were there, staff where awesome especially Tita. A very nice hotel but no restaurants or shops or convenience stores in walking distance so always had to get hotel to call a cab as it was usually cheaper than hotel transport but they also had a free shuttle going to Seminyak various times & twice to Kuta (but after dropping guests into Seminyak it often took 60-80 mins to get to Kuta) then we would get a cab back to hotel. So great hotel but would stay sonewhere that you can walk to places next time",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1834,Good stay,40,August 2015,"Hotel was great. Pool was beautiful, hard to get sun lounge have to get to pool side straight after breakfast. Breakfast not bad good variety hard to get eggs and bacon takes awhile. Room was clean and spacious, however our bathroom keeps flooding. Staff friendly. Good stay would recommend it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1835,Really enjoyed our stay,40,August 2015,"We arrived at the hotel about 12.30 and couldn't check into our room until 2pm. We went to the beach as all the sun beds around the pool were taken. There is only about 20 sun beds around the pool and the hotel is huge so be warned. When we arrived back we saw an unhappy customer who had not had their room and it was about 6pm. We asked about our room and had to wait about 30 minutes although we could have checked in 4 hours before? However once in our room, it was very nice and spacious. The room and bathroom were both very clean although the shower didn't drain properly. The hotel itself was very big and the staff were all very friendly. The provide bbq night which I thought were quite expensive for Bali. The breakfast is amazing and what youd expect in a 5 star hotel. There was a huge selection of food with cereals, fresh bread, pastries, waffles, eggs, salad, fruit and Thai savory foods. It filled us up for the day. As I've said before there are very limited sun beds so you should probably be there around 9am to get a bed in high season. Also the hotel is tall so the sun goes down about 3pm there. We used the gym a few times which was very basic but nice and quiet with air con. You can order hotel taxis to take you places at any time however we found these really expensive for Bali taxis so the front desk would called bluebird taxis which went on the meter. There are men outside which control the taxi service and open the doors and check the taxi once you've left. This made the hotel feel really safe and secure. Overall we had a really enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a very relaxing sun holiday.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1836,Distance is no problem,40,August 2015,We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel was great. Breakfast good. Was a bit worried about how far it was from things but it was fine. They have a transport service on site and set price for rides to popular areas. The drivers were always available and Balinese. Very friendly. Rooms were spacious. I would get a pool access room next time. Make sure you get a business card from reception before you head out in case your return taxi doesn't know it as the hotel is quite new. It got a bit busier over the weekend. But was all good class of customers.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1837,Poor wifi and internet service,30,August 2015,As many people write the hotel offers great value for money rooms are clean and the staff work hard to maintain high standards. My only observation is that the breakfast could be better and the food in general at the hotel is limited. The most frustrating aspect of this hotel is their internet service or should I say lack of service. The internet speed is so slow that you cannot send and receive emails or make online bookings for flights or other reservations. Yes this is a common problem on the island of Bali but needs to be addressed. Lastly being a new hotel many taxi drivers don't know the location of the hotel.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1838,Great Stay,50,August 2015,"Look no further this place is great, staff are super friendly and happy to help with anything including organising outside activities. Rooms are a great size and comfortable with a view from all rooms of the wonderful and large pool! Day bed in the water are the perfect option if you don't want to go completely into the water or if you have little ones that would like to swim in shallow water :) great for family holiday, holiday with friends or a romantic getaway.
Would highly recommend onto anyone going to Bali!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1839,AMAZING!!,50,August 2015,"We loved it!!! The rooms are beautiful along with all the staff. Very sad having to leave! We will be back for sure, Lovely food, very clean Recommend this place for sure! Special thanks to Evie, Tary and Reynold for making our stay a enjoyable one! Pool is amazing great atmosphere....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1840,No Encore for this hotel,20,August 2015,"Arrived here 2 days ago.Check in was ok until we were told we needed to leave a deposit/amount if we wanted to sign to our room when we purchased anything. It meant they took cash from our Visa card and we started paying fairly high interest on it immediately. As they have our card number, why is that necessary? We are fairly well travelled and it's a first for us.They gave us a voucher for a drink from the bar as our bed wasn't made up properly (we had requested a double, and they had a twin bedded room ready). Our free drink turned out to be the usual Bali welcome drink of sweet water! Nice room, bed enormous and very comfortable. It has tea and coffee making facilities. Fridge no good for keeping drinks etc cool. Lovely looking pool. Next morning at 8am and in a deep sleep after all the travelling over the previous 24 hours, we were awoken by screaming kids in the pool. I eventually staggered out to survey the pool area and apart from OMG - kids! the first thing I noticed was a desperate lack of sun loungers. There were about 12 cane loungers at one end of the pool, sitting in a shallow water area. Fine as long as you don't read electronic books or mind your towel getting wet round the edges. And uncomfortably hard. There were about the same number at the other end. In the middle is a bridge structure which has 8 (eight!) more sun loungers with comfortable mattresses. Apart from a couple of small cane settees the only chairs were in the dining area at wooden tables. For a hotel of this size this is just not enough - it was miserable watching guests troop aimlessly around looking for somewhere to sit. By today, the pool was cloudy, and I have seen no cleaning activity there at all. The breakfast is very very average - the dining room is split into two rooms, divided by tables and chairs, with ""hot"" food in one area and cold in another. In reality it's all cold, unless you have the patience to queue for an omelette or poached egg.There are two small pod coffee machines which need constant attending to by a waiter, due to the number of pods which needed to be emptied. This means queuing for ages if you want coffee. There was a very small selection of western food, a broader selection of Indonesian.This may be because the hotel seems to be very popular with guests from Jakarta and even closer. See the reviews. We tried the buffet tonight and it was truly awful, cold food, no variety, and not enough of what there was. It consisted of satay sticks, steamed rice, rice cakes, potatoes which were at breakfast, one container of a green vegetable, and apart from one other dish which looked very unappetising, a small plate of salad. Dessert was a jelly slice or fruit kebabs. OK so it was probably only about 20 bucks each, but you can get far better food for half that price elsewhere in Bali. The trouble is that this hotel is in a very poor location, miles from anywhere, so unless you take a taxi into Seminyak, you have no other option than to eat here. We will be taking a taxi from now on. Walk outside to the car park and negotiate a price - we paid $4.
The staff are very friendly but it takes forever to even get a cocktail. They really need to improve their training. We had a very good massage tonight in the ""Spa"", which turned out to be one of the hotel rooms on the 4th floor with two massage beds in it.
In summary, all I can say is it's cheap, and you get what you pay for.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1841,Great place depending on rate,40,August 2015,We stayed here for one week and got a great deal all in for 58 cad. For that price it included breakfast super deal the pool is large ( a little cloudy) nice lounging areas to catch the sun. Food was decent but better at the restaurants in Seminyak. Prices are average. Fitness was good not great but worth getting a 1-2 hour work out for sure. Good free weights and one good machine with cables. Great spot for the price,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1842,BEWARE!,10,August 2015,"As the previous post we arrived to check in and were made to pay the full accommodation costs plus a room service bond.
As soon as the credit card was authorised we were told that the rooms we booked was occupied and they had to put us somewhere else.
We booked pool access & ground floor for a reason, not impressed to be on the 3rd floor.
Be very wary - this hotel over books!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1843,Lovely hotel,50,August 2015,I really enjoyed my stay at the encore! The pool was lovely and was so relaxing and beautiful at night. The rooms were average size and the breakfast was great! The only thing for me was that when I was walking to my room it was very dark and the jungle to one side made it a bit creepy they should close that off as there were insects coming from there. It's at the end of the street but the free shuttle bus service to Seminyak and Kuta really makes up for it! The staff were lovely and the drinks at the bar were nice and at a good price! The only thing I would of liked is for the coffees at the bar to be included in the buffet breakfast. We also used the spa there and the ladies gave great massages professional and clean and at a very good price!,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1844,BEWARE !,20,July 2015,"On arrival we had to pay before we stayed, Delayed a day which we had to pay for but our room was still not ready ????? Next it was you must pay card deposit before you can charge back to your room. Unpleasant by the pool with yelling running noisy kids and who wants to lay on a lounge sitting in water ? Staff smiled a lot but could not communicate. Room noisy with TV blaring next door and kids rap dancing on the ceiling. Couldn't wait to get out of there. Service was hopeless.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1845,Need improvement and good cleaning & proper maintenance,20,August 2015,"Check-in process: our rooms are not ready when we checked in (at the correct time 2pm) and we had to wait for an hour.
Room category confusion: we booked through Agoda for pool-access rooms, with the exact description as lagoon rooms in Ramada Encore website. After long discussion, the lady manager finally understand the issue and rectify it by offerring alternative rooms / extra bed without breakfast.
Room condition: uninvited guests showed up in both bathrooms in both rooms that we stayed in. We had centipede and milipede on 1st day coming out from the shower water outlet and giant spider coming out from the ventilator on day 2.
Bed & pillows were fluffy and very comfy.
Pool: very big and lovely, however not being maintained and cleaned properly. On our 3rd day, the hotel closed down the pool for proper water treatment.
Customer service: most hotel staff do not greet people as many other hotels in Bali normally do. On several occassions, I initiated the proper smile and 'Selamat Pagi' to the hotel staff, so that they are aware of the lack of usual Indonesian friendliness.
Room amenities: I had to ask for shower gel & shampoos as they are not being topped up daily.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1846,Fall in Love with the ambience,50,April 2015,"i was staying here for 3 nights at deluxe pool view, this is a new and big hotel, i love the olympic pool its nice to swimming there, however they have to add more equipments in their kids club, but for the spa just so so",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1847,"Super clean, friendly and personal hotel! Amazing!",50,December 2014,"This place is amazing! The staff are so friendly and could never do enough to help! Always smiling and wanting to make sure your stay is the best it can possibly be!
The location is really close to seminyak if you have a car or bike but taxis aren't expensive either and can be ordered by the reception desk. Some staff knew me by name by the end of my week stay there which really added a personal touch. The rooms are spacious, super clean and fresh and the cleaning staff do a great job!
The food is a bit expensive for Bali but if you want cheaper there are plenty of local options (in walking distance)

Huge bed & more importantly very comfortable pillows (yes, we each got 2 of those micro fibre soft fluffy pillows: large & medium)... So comfortable that we almost missed our breakfast every single morning hahaha... It was exactly like in the pictures on the website...

1852,"will definitely stay here everytime we're in Bali, worth to try !",40,June 2015,"A new hotel in Seminyak. first impression when we check in was good, staff are helpful...staff served us welcome drink while waiting the room... hotel provide several very comfy sofa in lobby.
The Pool is the most I luv in this hotel. the pool was very big. hotel has complete amenities for free. When you stay here, choose the room with lagoon access (enjoy the pool directly from room).
The hotel is great for family to stay, you can enjoy the family room with 3 rooms (one master room & 2 rooms), living room, dining room, there's kitchen also if you wana cook, balcony with pool view.

my advice to hotel : its better to light up all the lights from balcony of each room at night to be more luxury and good to see. I believe ur visitors will enjoy more, last time I stay its little bit dark at night. lights are good at night :)
I stay here with family last month and will definitely come again on October.

I also already recommend this place to some of my friends and relatives and they enjoy their stay.

worth to try :)

enjoy ur day 1",Primera Hotel Seminyak

But this hotel was very nice with large pool with not that cold water and friendly staff... Location was a bit complicated but there were several signage on the street so it was ok..
Breakfast not that many selection but compare to price it is ok... If you need a room but you dont really care about the room size features but the swimming pool this is the place (doesnt mean their room is bad, room is also nice but my room view was car park view and room is not big)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1856,Loved the pool!,40,July 2015,the hotel has spacious rooms and the pool is great! Distance to seminyak beach is only a 5 minutes drive. The hotel also provides free one way shuttle service to kuta and seminyak. The cleaning of the bedsheets needs attention. Breakfast is sufficient but misses diversity. Overall a perfect place to stay in a quite area. Price versus quality definitely worth it.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

1858,Cozy Home in Seminyak,40,July 2015,"It is a new property with simple design. The staff were friendly and the service was good. My wife and me really love to enjoy the pool view at night. its made us feel cozy to relax in balcony. Overall, we loved this place so much.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1859,"Fantastic low cost option, best for families",50,July 2015,"This hotel is a relatively new property, although the room we were given on arrival had not been cleaned at all, our subsequent room and the property in general after that was spotless. This property is best for you if you have children, as the rooms all surround the pool and dining areas and children are up and about from very early on in the morning, you will not be afforded a lay in!
The property is not within walking distance of anything, i.e. shopping, restaurants, beach so bear that in mind if staying for a long time, you will need constant taxis, all a 5 min ride away. The taxi cost to town should be no more than 50,000k either way at all times of day or night, however watch out of taxis that will charge you 1-200,000k to return as it is normal to be grossly overcharged.
Food was not of gourmet standard, stick to pizzas and pastas for kids and head out for main meals, other than breakfast which is included and okay.
The staff make the property, they are all courteous and go out of their way at all times.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

They also had good security and employee that willing to recommend towards their guest. They also had bicycle rent and shuttle bus in hotel. Very helpful for us. But when I had breakfast there, a waiters give me some pork ribs that she said as beef ribs. After ask again to other waiters, he said that it is pork ribs. Maybe at the future better communication at the waiters.

1872,Pleasant probably lacking finesse,40,July 2015,"I have just returned from a 9 day stay at Ramada Encore Seminyak and for the most part it was really enjoyable.
Good points
Three bedroom suite was very well appointed with big rooms, great lounge and dining area.
Pool was clean and big enough to swim in different areas
Gym was basic but adequate
Gardens were really well established for such a new resort
People Era in particular were delightful in the typical gentle kind Bali manner

Opportunities for improvement
OMG the menu is boring. No specials and most food is fried and unhealthy. It is overpriced
Breakfast is ok for a couple of days but boring and lots of high sugar foods offered.

Indonesia and bali has so much to offer it would be great to have some activities to promote bali and make Ramada Encore a resort more than just a place to sleep or pool to swim in. This could include - simple bali intro to the language or yoga, cooking, making something (bamboo basket, art leather work) this would be great for the locals too, volleyball in the pool, local bike tour, walking tour for local area, info regarding temples and culture.

More shuttles or pick up after the drop off at 10 or 5pm. Not sure why this can't be incorporated into the schedule?

As per my title this resort has great potential but lacks some of the finesse to make you really want to return.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Problem occured during airport pick up for my sister who had booked a family room. I clearly reserved for an Elf car and it was confirmed by the staff. I even paid for it earlier. They got her a wrong car which couldnt fit for her fam and all the suitcases. Although at that time the airport staff was quick to reach a solution,still she was a bit dissapointed. Food was excellent, but during busy period, room service staffs seemed struggling and got some of our orders wrong. Swimming pool and our rooms were excellent and housekeeping did a very good job.

The rooms were large and clean, but I would agree with some of the other reviews that the hotel lacks atmosphere. I wouldn't come here if you wanted a romantic holiday, as there are kids running around (our kids, we had four families on our holiday). The food is not very good, so you have to go to Seminyak to eat, which we were happy with, but by the time you go in and out to Seminyak every day we spent about $20 a day on taxis. It only has two shuttles to Seminyak a day 10 am & 5 pm. We got a great deal on price, so we were happy to stay. We will be looking around at other places to stay next time.

1882,Very disappointing!,20,July 2015,"A hotel that has potential but just doesn't 'cut the mustard'. Our accommodation is a Superior Pool Room and to cut to the chase positives are:

Clean room;
Very comfortable bed;
Beautiful pool area;
Bar staff are very friendly and are well worth listening to for their local knowledge and recommendations of nice restaurants in Bali.

These are some of our not so positive experiences:

Very noisy corridors with house keeping staff (amongst children) some of the loudest offenders - especially early in the morning;
Room refrigerator does not get below 19 degrees (as informed by hotel staff) - therefore does not keep drinks cold;
Since being here (5 days so far) our bathroom supplies (for 2 people) have been limited to 1 x 30ml shampoo, 1 x 30ml conditioner, 1 x 30ml body wash, 2 x small discs of soap - I would expect all toiletries to be replenished each day???;
Bathroom is very small and not very well laid out;
A 3 day long disagreement with pool/towel attendants over the amount of towels we had taken as well as the fact that we had not returned them promptly, even though they still had our towel card. This resulted in twice daily phone calls to our room (mornings and evenings) in which ensured them that the towels would be returned. When we approached the pool/towel staff on the 3rd day to sort out the issue, one of the staff seemed to find it quite amusing - not impressed;
Call me pedantic, but each morning at breakfast I have had to search for salt and pepper shakers (it appears there are not enough for every table) as well as knives. Tables don't appear to be cleared and re-set with all necessary cutlery (maybe not a 'biggy' but I expect quality service in accordance with how this hotel is being promoted);
There are frequently problems with the two small coffee machines at breakfast which often require attendance by staff - I would suggest at least one staff member be dedicated to ensuring the smooth running of this station;
Being a non-smoker I was not impressed with wafts of cigarette smoke being blown towards me by other patrons while eating breakfast in the decking area under the main roof - perhaps designated smoking and non-smoking areas would be more beneficial.

Finally when asked to speak with the Manager about some of our concerns, we were promptly advised that she was in a meeting and would not be free until around 11.00am. In discussing our concerns with other hotel patrons, they also mentioned that this was the same response they got when asked to speak with the Manager. Perhaps it would be much more beneficial for the Manager and Management to spend less time in meetings and more time 'on the floor' guiding staff and practices, and liaising with hotel patrons.

Note to Management - please do not bother replying with your stock standard response (as per other reviews) because we will not be staying here again!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1883,Lovely place!,40,July 2015,"I love this hotel. Clean room, big pool and delicious foods! All the staffs were kind and helpful. I'll come back to this hotel again!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1884,No ENCORE here. Best I can do is a compliment sandwich. Without the compliments!,20,July 2015,"This Hotel was sold to us as a new 6 month old Resort in the popular eating district of Seminyak. Allegedly the Encore came well renowned from an American chain of hotels.

Hmm where to start. Yes rooms are new and clean. We stayed in a superior pool view. These are situated right above the bar on the ground floor. Hence very noisy. The bathroom is at best functional but very very small.

You can hear everyone above you endlessly moving wooden furniture, scraping it across the floor, and the hallways reverberate voices and footsteps. It is tiled and needs carpet to dampen the sound of the cleaners dragging buckets and trolleys at 7 oclock every morning and shouting out to each other down the corridor.

Heaven help you if you don't take the pool towels back by changeover of the pool towel boy. They will ring your room relentlessly to tell you that you must return towels or you will have to pay 150 000 rupiah for them. The staff are relentless at following rules. They have no people skills. They smile and nod.

The bar fridge in the room is not actually a refrigerator I was informed by management. It is not there to keep your drinks cold. After three days of requesting someone to look at the fridge which refused to get cold, I was informed it only went to 19 degrees and could keep my drinks in a real fridge behind reception. This is why they don't stock the mini bars to make extra money, because the really have bought wine fridges not designed to get very cold.

If you ever want to speak to the manager, the standard answer from reception is that she is in a meeting. So go and sit in the foyer and they will come and inform you that she is not available until 11 am. If you request for the manager to contact you they smile and nod. The call never comes!

If you want transport anywhere, because the Hotel is Not Walking distance to anywhere, staff will not ring you a Bluebird Taxi at first. They offer you the Hotel service like they are doing you a favour. The hotel service is simply a number of private vehicles with drivers who sit around down the road. The fee is a set fee. And yes it is too high. To go to the airport the set fee is 200 000 rupiah. At the Airport you can get a lift to the Hotel at 100 000 rupiah. Even the Javanese taxi drivers, who rip you off blind only want a set fee of 175 000 rupiah. A bluebird taxi on the meter will set you back about 40 000 rupiah to Legian, the special Hotel service was 70 000 rupiah.

After reading this review and others, if you still want to spend your hard earned dollars staying at this Hotel, well let me tell you that it is surrounded by rice paddies and fields which have tepid brown sewerage looking water flowing under the front of the hotel driveway. So with the afternoon breeze you can clearly smell sewer waste whilst sitting out around the pool and bar.

Staff are friendly, but don't care, they have been trained to do their job, but have no people skills, just smile and nod back

Currently in room 3214 above bar area. This location has the rooms to avoid at all cost. I can only sit and imagine how nice the rooms are down the other end of the long corridor. They must be the rooms referred to in the travel site 👍",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Beautiful ambience all around.Service and hospitality was upto the mark.No complaints whatsoever.A special thanks to Ms Arsani who was very prompt in her communications resolving many of our doubts before arrival .we had a very good driver cum guide who we hired from http://balibushire.com/bus-kia-pregio.html (Mahadev Sallan)
Special thanks again to the team of Ramada Encore for extending timely help after I met with a small accident.The hotel chefs went out of their way to prepare vegetarian breakfast for our veg friends .with all positive reviews I recommend this hotel as total value for money and much more",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Pool was good. Food average and waited a lifetime just to get s drink...",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1890,Noisy Hotel,30,June 2015,Noisy Hotel because of groups and no control in timetable of swimming pool. Some rooms ar on the bar and you have the music and people speaking and or escreaming. When you coimplain they offer you to change the room but they dont give solutions for future clients if they know the problematic.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1891,Nice room but unfriendly staf and service,30,July 2015,"Staying here for thee days. Room is nice and clean. You do hear sounds from the rooms next to you. Pool is nice. Quite a long walk to the beach and we could not go with the shuttle bus because it was already full. We didnt really mind the walk although its a bit scary in the dark with all the traffic. Staf was very unfriendly. When we arived the staffmember said something strange about our room, he tought it wasnt really pretty because we had no balcony. We found this a strange thing to day to guests. Ordered food at the pool, bin asked to sign the bill so we did, thinking this was okay for now and the bill went on the room. Went out to seminyak and when we came back they were at our hotelroom right away telling that we had to pay and were we had bin all day and they checked our room several times. We explained that we tought the bill was set on the room because we had to sing the bill and they didnt told us that we had to pay it right away. The staffmember stayed unfriiendly, even alter paying. We felt like criminals. We dont understand why and tought this was very unfriendly.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1892,Short and sweet stay...but fantastic!,50,July 2015,"We got in to Bali just after midnight and had transfers booked for Gili Island at 6.30am...so it was a short & sweet visit! However it was a very pleasant visit thanks to the fantastic service from all staff, very clean room, amazing value and a great breakfast...would go back again!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1893,a cool and comfortable stay,40,July 2015,"We booked this hotel for a three bed suite and were pleasantly surprised to find it so nice and spacious. It had a large family room, a kitchentte, dining area along with three bedrooms and a large balcony overlooking the beautiful lagoon pool below. We had an excellent stay in this place. The breakfast spread was great, the staff very courteous and helpful. The seminyak market is just walking distance from the hotel. They even have shuttle service from the hotel to seminyak and kuta beach. Excellent stay for people travelling in a big group.I would highly recommend this hotel. Thanx for a very pleasant stay there.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1894,"very nice hotel would recomend to freinds,only problem was...",50,June 2015,"very nice hotel would recomend to freinds,only problem was breakfast hard to get a table.and you wait for a while to get a coffee as they only have two small coffee machines and half the time they are not working.need more of western food,cater too much for asians....",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1895,Families first!,40,July 2015,"This is a relatively new hotel, located some distance from the main roads. The quiet, self-contained location will appeal to those with young children or those seeking a quieter experience in Seminyak. The hotel rooms are competitively priced for what is included and the staff are courteous, friendly and helpful at all times.
The breakfast bar is standard, although not very well set up for more European tastes. It also doubles as the bar and dining area, located by the central pool. There is room for some improvement with layout of breakfast items, but generally works efficiently.
On the down side, guests will need to plan their travel carefully, using either taxis or the infrequent shuttle bus (10am departure), unless walking 2 kilometres is a preference. Similarly, hotel information in the rooms is minimal. If you wish to have laundry done, you may need to ask for the order form, and also advise housekeeping ( if you can find their number!) that it needs to be picked up. In my case, I left the laundry out before leaving the room at 8am but it transpired it wasn't picked up until 3pm,which meant it would not be ready until the next day. When I rang to politely complain that this was not what should have happened, the laundry was expedited and returned to my room that evening! Full marks.
All in all, a very pleasant haven away from the madness of Kuta and the tourist madness!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1896,Very impressive :|,10,July 2015,"I booked this hotel for one day only for 1-2 July 2015 with detail: Deluxe lagoon pool acess and requested twinbeds and babycot under the name Mr.George.H
What happened is when i arrived at 3pm they try to give me room 3303on 3rd floor....after short discussion they offer me room 1301 which is on 1st floor but no acess to pool. They said that all the pool acesss already taken and for the price that i ve paid now is less than it supposed to for lagoon acess( i have the printed voucher from a****a.com) anyway its a holiday so im okaying all what they said after waiting 90minutes the room is still not ready at 4.30. So i asked to change my room to 3303 and ask for my baby cot(as i mention before-its printed in my hotel voucher request) and they said that they run out of babycot( befor that during 90minutes waiting they said that they still assembling the room and babycot.
In the end i took the room 3303 and small refund. They do help the process after.......everything",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1897,What I wanted,50,June 2015,It was an amazing hotel faultless except the location so far away from Kuta. Great for relaxing. Amazing breakfast and rooms. Although smaller than in photos.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1898,Relaxing stay at Ramada Encore,40,June 2015,"We stayed in a room with lagoon access and it was pleasant. There were mosquitoes in the room and was remedied with insect spray. The bed is huge and comfortable. The toilet is small but complete with toiletries. The same set of breakfast buffet each day, but with a variety of dishes.

The hotel is far from Seminyak Beach but there is scheduled drop off and pick up time (2x each day). Hotel facilities are great (swimming pool, gym and kid's playhouse).

It is a taxi away to Jalan Camplung Tanduk for clubbing (by hotel taxi, fare is 40,000 rupiah). Taxi on the way back depends on taxi company (if BlueBird group - it only cost 20,000 rupiah). If you get another taxi company, minimum fare is 40,000 rupiah.

If you want to stay near the beach, Ramada Encore is not for you. It is for couples and families who want a relaxing time in Bali, away from the hustle and bustle of the city center.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1901,Beautiful! Value for money!,50,June 2015,"Very nice hotel. The staff make the stay worth it. Ask for Mr. Abdi, he's the go-to man. He'll do everything to make ur stay even more comfortable.

1903,Very nice!,40,June 2015,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is beautiful and our room was very nice. The staff are very friendly. The only two things I would say is on location wise we were stuck in the hotel for 5 days as we didn't want to rent a car or moped. We did rent bicycles but on the main road there isn't really a path. The location is great for people who want to spend time in this luxury resort and they do offer a one way shuttle bus if you did want to get out. The second thing I would say is that the service in the restuarant although incredibly friendly was very slow at times. We would wait for a very long time for everything. Even though there was sufficient staff. On average a meal would take over an hour and we take about 10 minutes to eat. These are my only negatives. Overall we had a lovely time. The food was delicious, rooms immaculate, service although slow was lovely, massage was great and the gym and pool where good.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1904,New and quiet good location,40,June 2015,The pool is sensational. Perfect for everyone from a toddler to an athlete. It very big. Could use a few more sunbeds that are out of the water but plenty if you like to actually be in the pool. Rooms are good size bathrooms a little small but still good. Hotel is nine month old. And is about 10 mins walk from Sunset Road and in a taxi $3 to Seminyak square. There is a shuttle twice a day to Kuta and Seminyak. I thought this was a really good option if you wanted something nice but quiet. It is a big hotel and will really need to keep maintenance up to keep it looking nice. Spa service in hotel was good and well priced. Every single staff member was happy and helpful. My only small complaint was the breakfast food was average. This may have been because we get up at 6.30 but certainly every day we thought it could have been done better. Just need a good chef. All in all this is super good value for money and in a really nice location if you like peace and quiet. Excellent bed and bedding,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1905,Wonderful Stay,40,June 2015,Hotel was clean and customer service was good and they were very friendly. Room was spacious and facilities were well taken care of. Toilet corners were slightly dirty. Breakfast spread limited and lacking meat. Exact change was not given accordingly and hotel taxis were pricey. WIFI connection was poor.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

1908,Bali holliday,40,June 2015,Great hotel. Fabulous swimming pool was a bit disappointed in breakfast they seem to cater mainly for the Asian market ....also hotel was to far to walk to seminyak all though they did supply a free shuttle all in all a good hotel,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1909,FantasticHotel,50,June 2015,"I have to say that my week at Ramanda Encore was just fantastic, from the wonderful staff at front desk to the shuttle coach guys they could not have been more friendly, as the we already know the Balinese people are gentle beautiful people.
I also have to say the room attendants were so helpful and cleaned our room amazingly, the bedding was so clean and the pillows were to dye for your head just sank in them, and went to sleep so easy, we decided to go to king Koil and buy some. The free shuttle service was free, great wi fi, will definitely stay again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1910,Even better than we expected.,50,June 2015,"After booking the hotel only days before and not knowing what I was expecting it's safe to say my mother and I were both more than pleased with our stay.
Assuming this was a new and budget hotel I originally thought it may have skimped on some of the necessities and luxuries of higher end hotels, however this was far beyond the case.
All staff were 10/10 and helpful, the taxi service was also very helpful.
The pool, foyer and rooms were spotless.
Yes it is a tiny bit out of Seminyak (only a 5min 30,000 rupiah can ride) but the taxi service and free shuttle is there to assist.
Very happy with our stay, especially the money we spent on our room.
Highly recommend.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1911,Quiet location,30,June 2015,"Nice hotel, but you need transport to the centre of Seminyak. Shuttle bus only one way $3 rtn taxi. Breakfast nice, but catered more for Asian cusine. Rooms clean and bed comfy. Pool area is nice. Prices for drinks and food reasonable for Bali. Room service food was very good. We didn't eat in the restaurant, except for breakfast. We had lagoon access room which was great, but try not to get one with a connecting door as when there are guest next door it gets noisy.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1912,Excellent hotel in amazing Bali,50,June 2015,"We stayed at the hotel for 11nights. First impression of the hotel was nice and clean and in a quiet location whuch we preferred. Hotel facilities were excellant and restaurant and spa was value for money. We were able to get taxis very easilly and spa treatments were vaule for money and thoroughly enjoyed the various treatment we did. The staff are the most friendliest and welcoming people I have come across happy to help and always with a smile from yhe reception team, cleaner, restaurant and spa staff. I would personally like to thank Ray from the bar. He made a Singapore Sling for me which tasted just as good as the orginal from Singapore. Living in London nobody has been able.to make it as close so thank him and the lovely chats we had. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would be happy.to return again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1913,Good Stay,40,June 2015,"Quiet. Remote place. But still ""tukang"" or staff hang out sitting at the corridor or hall at night. I'm pretty sure they weren't supposed to be there. That's a bit uncomfortable for the guests.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1915,5 star service at an affordable price! Do not hesitate go and book!,50,May 2015,"I Stayed here toward end of May for 4 nights, I booked two types of rooms, one superior room and one deluxe pool view. Worth paying a little bit more for the pool as it is more spacious and the view of the lagoon pool, just gorgeous. Its a brand new hotel, just 6 months old so everything still clean, immaculate and new. Rooms are very clean, sheets and pillows white and soft. Buffet Breakfast was a treat and catered for westerners and asians. Service was just great, seriously like 5 star. anything I needed they assisted and always with a smile. The lagoon pool just gorgeous, and has a kiddy pool too, for the young ones.You do get sunlight at this hotel if any one is concerned. I ate a couple of times at the onsite restuarant and food was good. I also had a massage onsite and it was good too. So overall I would higly recommend this hotel, for the price it is good value for money especially for a new hotel. I will point out the positives and negatives just for information and improvements. Positives:* Hotel and grounds beautiful and new. *Affordable with 5 star service. *restaurant food and spa massages good. *buffet breakfast variety, fresh and delicious. *wifi good Negatives:* Location, no mini markets close by, is about a 7minute walk to and back. No other restaurants close by, have to walk about 7-10mins for one. *They have set price for taxi service provided, and price is quite expensive, they should change these prices as the hotel location is a bit of an inconvenience but if you don't mind walk out of the hotel and walk abit and hail out your own cab.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

nothing is too much trouble and the staff go out of their way to accommodate us we feel so at home and very welcome. Fortunately we still have plenty more time to enjoy our 8 week stay at this fabulous hotel.

1919,Beautiful hidden treasure,50,June 2015,"Thankyou Ramada Encore for the beautiful stay in Seminyak. I would highly recommend this hotel to families and friends. The hotel is so clean, the staff are so friendly and attentive. The breakfast to very good. The rooms are spacious, clean and very tidy. The ambience of the place is very nice. Great entertainment on Saturday night. Very easy quick taxi fair into Seminyak square. The resort also have a courtesy bus two drop offs per day 10am & 5pm. I would give the resort a 10/10 for one of the cleanest pools we have used. All in all great place to stay and our children loved it too. They are rebooking for next year. Keep up the good work all. If you want to stay close to shops and the city centre (this would not suit) but a very quick taxi ride and very close taxi ride to the beach. Very quiet and very good pricing on both food and drinks.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1920,5 excellent nights,50,May 2015,"My 22 year old daughter and I found this online whilst looking for a place to stay after our 8 days in Ubud.
I booked a twin room on late stays and the price was very reasonable.
The hotel is just 6 months old and the facilities and service were excellent. As usual Balinese staff are attentive and courteous and seek to do their very best. The room was fine for two and I particularly like having a couch.
I saw some criticism of the breakfast but found it excellent and offered all I would ever need in the morning. Love the omelettes but the range of rice , noodles, fresh fruits, breads, croissants, coffee provided great choice.
I liked the location which was away from the noise and activity of Seminak but close enough for me to walk to everything. I even walked to the beach which took about 40 minutes.
Blue taxis caught nearby are cheaper than using a hotel taxi which you must use if you catch it from the foyer. You can walk down the road and get a cheaper taxi.
For me, I would not bother chasing other hotels if I go back. I will just book directly with the Ramada Encore as I was 100% satisfied with my stay.

Just one thing which is not just a problem for this hotel but all in Indonesia. That is tolerance of smoking. It was not major problem but some guests smoked in passageways and in the restaurant. I believe the Indonesian laws will catch up soon and prohibit this.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1921,Awesome holiday,50,June 2015,"Great hotel and the staff were very attentive. I had a great time chilling near the pool with cocktails and good snacks. The pool is a beautiful setting with lots of quiet places to hide away and enjoy the sun. BBQ nights were fun and the bar staff always made you a welcome.

A short taxi ride to the the shopping area, and the shuttle bus will take you to Seminyak or Kuta, free of charge. Return trip from Kuta by Taxi is $5.00( Aust).Staff are great. Buffet breakfast was satisfactory. Staff need more training in the Restaurant, their knowledge of customer service needs improvement.

1930,Amazing hotel for the price paid,40,May 2015,"10 of us stayed in 5 rooms. 3 were superior rooms and 2 were deluxe rooms with pool view ( free upgrade). Since it is a new hotel, everything was spanking clean and fresh. Wifi was very good. Good selection of food during buffet breakfast. They catered for vegetarians too. They cooked veg noodles for few of us on request. Bit further away from the city centre but they have a shuttle to Seminyak square. But you need to book the shuttle early. When I tried to book the shuttle, Receptionist told me the van has taken other guests while an assistant was sick. After a bit of arguing, we were provided the shuttle which was parked outside! Not sure who was lying but it seemed like they were trying to push their paid service. Other than that, had a very good experience, especially for the price.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

I come for honeymoon, hoping whether can get upgrade room but reception said cannot.
The reception is OK, not too friendly though when I check in but different person when I checkout is friendly. The room is spacious. It has the most cozy and fluffy pillow ever!
Breakfast menu is excellent, coffee is very good.
I will come back again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1932,Beautiful hotel,40,May 2015,We had booked our first night after landing in that hotel. First of all price is very reasonable compared to the beautiful facility this hotel offers. I have never seen such a beautiful swimming pool. The location is not amazing as it is a bit in the back roads but it is counterbalanced by the fact that they provide a free shuttle drop off service and then to go back to the hotel by taxi is quite cheap anyway. We actually stayed another night to take it easy and being able to explore seminiyak and kuta. Staff is very nice and helpful. It can be convenient to eat in the hotel but the food is not amazing and a bit expensive compared to other places in the city centre,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1933,The Best place to stay in Bali,50,May 2015,"We had booked this place for a special day in our life. Ours sons Birthday. The staff in the hotel was the best when it comes to hospitality. The ambiance was superb. The staff was friendly. Cleanliness wise this was the best hotel ever.
Cheers to the hotel management. Thank you for making our stay pleasant.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1934,Great value resort with great staff and facilities!,40,May 2015,"Great resort considering the amount that we paid to stay here. Fully equipped gym, great variety breakfast buffet (although the hot food was more lukewarm than hot), amazing lagoon pool and staff who couldn't do enough to help us. The girls at the spa do a great massage (and for a really reasonable price) although if I'm going to be picky, the beauty menu could be expanded to do manicures, pedicures, etc. Located a fair way from the action in Seminyak but there is a free shuttle during the day and a taxi is only $3 the rest of the time. Overall, great value for money. Would highs recommend, especially if you are looking for a pool resort holiday away from hustle and bustle.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1937,Great bed and a good nights rest,30,May 2015,"We stayed for one night and were very happy with our stay. While a short cab ride away from the heart of Seminyak, the room itself was clean and modern and the bed was like a cosy cloud. Great value for money with a decent breakfast and free shuttles into Seminyak. Nice pool too.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1938,Beautiful Bali,50,May 2015,Six days in paradise is not enough. Absolutely loved the ramada encore. Pool is Gert. Service is great. Staff is super friendly and rooms very clean..

1939,Enjoyable and Affordable Stay,50,May 2015,"Customer Service was helpful and friendly. Nice Good size room, looks new and clean with a Balcony and pool view! Fantastic Bar lounge. Kid's Gym was quite well equipt. Location is a little bit far from beach and centre of attraction, but can be reach in mins by Taxi. Hotel & all facilities rooms and swimming pool all clean and look exceptionally new. Wifi was working great, no problem whatsoever. Breakfast was delicious but choice was limited. The downside of this hotel were only minor, e.g there were a lot of caterpillars crawling on lobby and other foot path across first floor but not in rooms. It would have been better if they put a curtain or window blinds on the kids gym to block the sun when room is not in use as it got quite stuffy and hot to enter after being closed for hours and sun shot through window straight to the room. We had to wait for 15-20 mins for Aircon to cool the room before being able to get the kids in to play. Apart from that, it was an excellent hotel compared to other hotels I have stayed in bali. We have a great experience with this hotel and my kids enjoy playing in the hotel swimming pool and its kids gym very much that they couldn't be bothered to explore what bali has to offer :p . We will definitely come back! And will recommend this hotel to anyone we know especially to families! Thank you Ramadha Encore and its lovely friendly staffs. We'll see you again one fine day. :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1940,Ramada Encore Seminyak top value for money,50,May 2015,"Our stay in Ramada Encore Seminyak exceeded our expectations , from the arrival till departure everything was just perfect. Couldn't fault the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, room and bathroom very clean, loved the quality of the pillows n mattress , we stayed in Deluxe room Pool view. The lagoon pool was great,free shuttle bus available on the hour to Seminyak Square or twice per day to Discovery Kuta. I did find the hotel food pricey so eat out better and call for Bluebird taxi to take you to the airport as it will only cost Rp.70000 instead of the Rp.150000 hotel was charging. Location is less than 10 mins away from hustle bustle of Seminyak shops . WiFi excellent.Thank you Ramada Encore, will recommend you for sure .",Primera Hotel Seminyak

I wasn't convinced, I know usually omelettes are not well done. I heard snickering. A waiter was laughing at me and didn't look away. So I'm clown now?

1947,Encore Ramada Seminyak,50,April 2015,Shuttle was excellent but could be more often and offer a return trip. Staff were amazing. Rooms were noisy between rooms.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1948,A very nice hotel,40,May 2015,Needs more non smoking areas especially non smoking floors and breakfast areas. People even smoked in the lift. Smoke wafted into my room at night from adjoining rooms. Lovely hotel but like a lot of Asia smoking is normal and acceptable in all areas. Breakfast great if you could stand the smoking.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1949,good hotel with quite difficult access,40,March 2015,"Hotel was very nice. Good breakfast, nice pool, excellent service.
But somehow ... there was one flaw ... I booked the hotel via Booking.com, I chose carefully since I do need sofa in my room, I select the standard superior room and it was written in Booking.com that there supposed to be a sofa inside the room, a photo of the room confirms it too. Unfortunately, once I arrived in the room ... there is no sofa, when I asked the receptionist, she said ... there is no sofa, unless I upgrade my room to superior room with pool view ... that's disappointing. :-(",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1950,Great hotel for a Bali Getaway,40,April 2015,"Only 6 months old, the hotel is great, lovely & new, best beds ever, super swimming pool, lovely friendly staff who were always happy to try and please. Breakfast had great choices and we loved Evie one of our severs. Other food food was average but prices for both food & drinks were very reasonable. Massages especially the Balinese one & reflexology really good & prices great too. House keeping staff very friendly & accomodating but sometimes lacked consistency in making sure some toiletries were replaced daily but loved the towel figures they left on the bed. I know in every new property there's always teething problems. Great for families who want quality on a budget as swimming pool is not too deep and very big. Just a little too far out sometimes and not all drivers know where it is, usually Bluebird taxis were best. Just take a card from front counter with the address. Overall very very enjoyable!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1955,Excellent value for money,50,May 2015,"I booked two nights for me and my partner and three nights for two of our daughters and their partners (three rooms) through booking.com and have been very happy with all aspects of our stay. The rooms were fine, beds very comfortable, food very good and service excellent. The buffet breakfast was extensive, the pool is huge and getting a taxi cheap and easy. The rest of our trip to Bali we stayed in villas and while the hotel didn't allow for the ambience or family time the villas did, it was a good way to finish our stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1957,Nice Choice!,40,April 2015,Had 3 nights stay this hotel and I can tell it was nice experience. All of our request were being made. Our room were clean and had a nice pool view. Spa & Massage services are pretty enjoyable and professional.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1958,Good solid choice,40,April 2015,"The biggest draw for the Ramada is by far the swimming pool, it is as nice as the photos suggest, with a shallower pool for children. We booked using an Agoda secret deal price and so were happy with the hotel for the price paid.
The rooms are spacious with a decent en suite and very comfortable beds, my room was fine however my friend had tiny ants in the bathroom. This wasn't a problem for us and is to be expected in the tropics!
We found the hotel shuttle very accommodating, taking us into Seminyak town on demand, as well as booking a private driver and airport transfer through the front desk.
Breakfast was plentiful as well as plenty choice - cereal, fruits, bread etc, egg station and Asian choices. One morning was particularly busy and they were almost running out of tables, if this hotel was ever at 100% capacity I'm not sure there would be space. However, that seems to be some way off as it seemed that not all bedrooms were yet ready on the higher floors.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1961,comfortable but soso,30,April 2015,"Trip began with no transfers a per prearranged, hot and a half at the airport waiting, then told to get a taxi by reception. Arrived at 3am, rooms not ready and another 40min wait for them. Beds pushed together and not the same height make for uncomfortable sleeping. But, staff were finally and resort was clean, just not a good start.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1962,Not so good,30,May 2015,"So i spent two nights in Ramada Encore.

first off, the floor in our room its not so clean, there's a sticky spot in almost everywhere( i don't know what it is) so we have to use hotel's sandals and to mention that our bed linen got some sands on it.

Second when we had our breakfast, i ask for some bacon which the bacon is not supplied in the table so you have to ask the waiters. They said they ran out of bacon this morning.. But a couple minutes after, i saw one of the waiters were handing one plate full of bacon for one of the guest. Why???

And i did find the coffee/tea spoons were dirty like it was unwashed from previous use.

However, the staff's are friendly, nice pool and if its without any above complaints, i'd say its worth it to stay here.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1963,Just a ok visit,50,April 2015,Booked a lagoon pool access room and upon going to my room found it to be not what I had booked. There was a garden off my balcony. I immediately told reception that it wasnt what I booked and they were more than happy to change my room which had a 1hr wait which was ok. Upon reading previous reviews someone had stated that this happened to them as well. Hotel grounds are well maintained and rooms were spacious and direct access to the pool was great. One thing I found in the rooms at night the mossies are really bad. Breakfast selection was very poor and often cold. I only ate there once. The hotel provides a shuttle service to which I could never get because it was either on airport pickups or elsewhere so I used local transport which hotel organised. 30k to seminyak and 70k to legian kuta. The hotel also has mountain bikes for hire for 20k for 10hrs but the roads are very busy and it was quite a experience trying to cross sunset road in peak hour. Staff are all very friendly and helpful and im sure over time minor issues will be addressed. Would stay here again just to see if things have improved because really for the price of the stay its hard to pass.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1964,Aiming high but a few teething problems perhaps,30,April 2015,"Stayed for just one night recently as we were meeting up with friends for dinner. Unlike others, we had no difficulty finding the hotel (Google maps did a brilliant job) and were delighted to find excellent car parking facilities for the first time ever in Bali. Check-in staff were friendly and very efficient, even though we arrived a bit early and we were soon in our room. The staff also explained the facilities well. A shuttle bus is regularly available to various locations but it is also a short walk to the heart of Seminyak.
Like others we found the almost constant noise of doors being slammed and conversations of other guests in the corridor quite annoying. With corridor floors tiled, it seems that there are few acoustic treatments to minimise noise. The housekeeping staff with their trolleys might also benefit from the occasional reminder to be respectful of guests sleeping or resting.
That said, we found the room well appointed, the bed extremely comfortable and the breakfast a real treat. We appreciated the housekeeping staff checking with us in the late afternoon to make sure everything was ok but dismayed to discover that although we reported the fridge not working nothing was done to fix it for us during our stay. (3239)
With so many hotels on offer in the Seminyak/Kerobokan area this one is reasonably priced but perhaps needs some more time to settle into a routine in order to ensure that facilities are maintained to a high standard.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1965,Stay for the first time,40,April 2015,"For the first time come to this hotel, little bit difficult to find, you have to put the sign more bigger and clear at every crossroad.
Architecture design was nice and comfort for staying, but some wall paint getting chipped, so you have to keep the building maintenance better. The shower booth without door makes the toilet floor too wet.
The meals for breakfast need to add more variance, specially on salads, and you have to add the egg spot or chef, because sometime we have to have a long queue.
I expect you can add the amusement, like billiard table and others for free.
Generally speaking for staying in this hotel was great and and we got comfortability during holiday.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Cons: slow service at bar and restaurant in terms of payment. Food menu a little boring. Cocktails weren't great. Sun loungers had mouldy cushions.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1967,Great staff but noisy guests,40,April 2015,"If you do not mind being away from the beachfront, this place is fine. The staff are excellent, very attentive, efficient, polite and pleasant. The corridors are rather bleak, but the rooms themselves are good. The pool is excellent.
Unfortunately, there are groups of noisy Chinese guests that do not consider that other guests appreciate tranquility. They shout at each other across the dining area and exhibit very bad table manners.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1968,5 star hotel feeling with an affordable price!,50,April 2015,"If you are looking for an affordable hotel with a touch of class, well this is a good hotel i can recommend. You dont need to settle for anything less as this is a good hotel. Near airport yet near nightlife, beach is reachable by free bus transport ( check with the hotel staff re:timing). Anywhere is reachable by a BLUE BIRD cab/taxi but if you want a private tour with flexible timing and affordable price ( very safe tour guide) i can give you the info just drop any question on my email add rhuvic_25@yahoo.com

1969,MY STAY,20,April 2015,"swimming pool area first class, however the over all service was very poor.
The meals very small, but not the price, and very often had to wave hand to get noticed, The designer of the complex seems to have forgotten that such a big complex requires more than the two lifts, long way to walk to breakfast.

1972,"Nice hotel, great staff",50,April 2015,"We stayed from 20-24 Apr 2014. The hotel is beautiful & clean. Wifi was SUPERB!

Location:
Only problem for us is the location. Its not the kind of place where you can just walk out to shops/restaurants nearby. You need a car/taxi to get out (10-20mins) to Kuta area. We hired a driver throughout our stay so it was fine.

Staff:
The staff surprised me with a birthday cake with my name on it while we were having breakfast. Wonderful surprised - thank you.

The housekeeping staff made an animal with towels and left a small note to wish me 'happy birthday' while making up our room. Thank you SASTRAWAN for your wonderful effort & gesture.

Will recommend the hotel to those who doesnt mind 'no shops/marts/eateries' in the surrounding.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1973,"Exceptional value, good location, helpful staff.",50,April 2015,"New hotel everything clean smart, very comfortabe pillows and beds. Good location away from 'crazy Bali' but close to a small mini mart, $3 cab to Seminyak or free shuttle hourly and free to Kuta twice per day it's nowhere near as rural or outback as I feared from some reviews (I had visions of some isolated building down a farm track which it really is not). We have realistic expectations and were not disappointed, in fact we could not ask anymore. Great value for money. Pool side rooms were great.
Breakfast was comprehensive and comparable to other International hotels (muesli and hot water would be good additions if I was being really picky)
Food from hotel was pretty good at a reasonable price, the staff were willing to accommodate my vegetarian diet and adapted a few of the menu choices as we requested - very obliging. The spa treatments were great (the room/setting could be improved) and the airport transfer system efficient door to door.
The hotel excelled when I got pretty ill (virus-not hotel problem) and needed a Dr and subsequent hospital visit. They got a doctor very quickly for us, drove us to the hospital in the hotel car and advised where best to go. On return to the hotel they thoughtfully sent a lovely complimentary platter of fruit to the room. They really impressed with their concern and serviced the room around my needs which is just what I needed when feeling so bad. Staff were friendly to us all and chatted with our 3 kids. I'm sorry I couldn't properly thank the staff as we left because they definitely deserved some praise.
Thank you! We wish this new hotel and staff all the best for the future and would definitely recommend to friends and family,",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1974,"Love it, I hope they maintain their qualities",40,March 2015,"We stayed for 12 nights. And it was a very pleasant stay. The food, the massage and the pool are awesome.
I see many people complain about the location, but for us, it is perfect. It is peace and quiet area but yet not so far away from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak.
We advise you to rent a motorcycle to get around in Bali. It is easier and much more efficient.

There are some room for improvements on their facilities maintenance, while we stayed there we had problem with our shower drain, it was clogged. We report it in the morning, and in the afternoon it was already fixed.
The room sound proof is really bad, to tackle that problem probably the hotel can have quiet zone between 10pm - 7am to avoid disturbance to other guests.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1975,Fabulous hotel!!,50,April 2015,"We spend 6 nights at Encore and could not have been happier.

The hotel is a little way away from the main area of Seminyak, however the hotel offer a free shuttle service between 10am-5pm which we used. Otherwise it was a quick 5 - 10 minute walk to the nearest main road where there were always taxis able to pick you up and take you to the heart of Seminyak for as little as $2 AU. The hotel also offers a taxi service if you want to venture further away than Seminyak.

The room was lovely. Standard hotel room with all the amenities you need. The bed was very comfortable, bathroom - clean and compact, air conditioning - cold.

The pool area is where the hotel shines. Such a large pool and beautifully maintained. The water was the perfect temperature to cool you off. And plenty of sun lounges to choose from.

The bar and restaurant were great too. The food was reasonably priced and everything we ate from there was delicious. The hotel also offered breakfast within our booking price which we took advantage of most days. The choices were mainly Indonesian, however there was also croissants, toast, cereals, pancakes, eggs any way you liked and if you asked, the chefs were more than happy to make you bacon (even though it was not served in the main buffet area).

My husband and I tried out the spa a few times during our stay. The ladies who do the massages were amazing! Definitely recommend the signature massage. 1 hour for only $12.50 AU. Best massage I have ever had.

Overall I can not say anything bad about this hotel. The staff were so friendly and always willing to help you. The price is very low considering the standard of hotel.

We had a really enjoyable time for the nights we were there and are already planning our next holiday. We will definitely be recommending this hotel to family and friends.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The hotel being secluded is not a problem as we can always take a cab or hire drivers if we need to go sightseeing.

Overall i am truly impressed with what Encore had to offer.

Well done!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1979,Exceptional personal service when troubles arise,40,April 2015,"Stayed here for a week in April.Staff were very pleasant.Room was lovely and serviced every day.Although they offered an excellent buffet breakfast most dishes had gone cold by the time most people ate.
HOWEVER,where they excelled was when an ATM gobbled up my debit card in Siminyak and gave no money out.For three days they sent an employee interpreter with me to various banks to reclaim my card.When I did eventually get my card back it would not work in any ATM.The bank(ACB) then directed me to a place where I could use the card over the counter the next day.This went well.I cannot say how helpful the young lady the hotel sent with me.She was amazing and polite and cute.With out her I would have had a stressful time communicating with all the bank staff at various locations.
Thank you Ramada Encore and Tita",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Brand new hotel with very large rooms and a lagoon pool beautiful, I did not like the breakfast as unvaried and of poor quality, but for what I paid I was satisfied.
There is a shuttle to Seminyak but only during the day in the evening you have to take a taxi because the location is very far from the center.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

1985,Disappointed !,20,April 2015,"We stayed for one week in the family deluxe room - we upgraded to have the pool access which I am glad we did as none of the lifts were working while we were there and this would of been a pain with strollers etc
The family room was good and spacious but had no cutlery or crockery and nothing to use to cook with which I found strange considering they had hot plates and a 6 seater dining room table - even a dish cloth to wipe down the bench would of been good.
The breakfast was very boring and bland and after 4 days of eating it (it did not change at all over one week) we couldn't even bring ourselves to eat it any more.
When room service was ordered it never came with cutlery and would take half an hour for the staff to return with it (we were just picking at our meals with our fingers and had usually eaten the meal before they had returned). They sold out of Coke and Soda Water at the bar which I thought was strange and pretty slack.
The day we checked in the pool was CLOSED !!!! this is Bali and it was so hot !! It continued to be closed for a total of a day and a half and to be honest it looked terrible.
When it re opened we all went swimming - you could smell the chemicals so at least we knew it was being treated. ALL our swimwear , swim vests , clothing lost all its colour within two days of swimming and had all turned green - a gross brown green too . We complained to the staff who offered to wash half of our swimwear to see if this fixed the problem and it didn't - we asked to speak to management which took 4 days for him to come and see us. When the manager came to our room with the housekeeper he did not speak one word at all to us and half way through our conversation he started text messaging on his phone !! We thought this was so rude - the housekeeper offered to pay our $7 cab fee to the airport - we said to forget it and we threw $500 worth of swimmers etc in the bin when we left.
Our hair all turned green and as well as our skin - we had to scrub it off it was actually stained on patches of our body - not to mention all the ear infections and rounds of gastro we now all have !!!
This is the first time I have ever stayed in a resort and I have not been asked at check out if I was happy and enjoyed my stay ......maybe they knew the answer would of been NO !",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1986,"Good service, but poor location",30,April 2015,"The service here is excellent, the staff were very friendly and helpful. However, the location is a bit out of the way and the day we stayed the shuttle bus was late to start. We couldn't wait for it as we had a short amount of time in Seminyak. Our room was very nice, small but functional. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast was okay, nothing special. The safe in our room didn't work but reception had it fixed straight away.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1987,Nice little hotel,40,April 2015,"The hotel itself is quite cosy and out of the hustle and bustle of seminyak. However the main issue was that it was a bit too far away to safely walk to any nearby shops or attractions. The hotel itself was nice and clean and the staff did a great job of cleaning it every day. However there were a few things that were a bit odd, like when we arrived, there was a mini bar in our room but it was empty... When we queried it they said we had to order the mini bar. The air con in this hotel is amazing, it's great for the hotter months. The pool is also quite nice. We got a massage at the 'spa', the massage itself was wonderful and fairly priced, but the spa itself was just a hotel room with two massuage tables in. I think it would definitely be worth upgrading the spa facilities because the masseuses did such a great job. This hotel would be great for young families! Overall we enjoyed our stay at Ramada Encore and thank the staff for their great service.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1988,Bit disappointed,30,April 2015,"This place has potential, but it's really a mixed bag. We had a Family Room, which had 3 bedrooms (2 king, 2 single), 2 bathrooms and 2 toilets, a shared living and dining area, 2 TVs and a balcony overlooking the pool. There is a dinning table and a large fridge/freezer, kettle, hotplate, microwave and kitchen sink. The 4 aircon units worked well. Good working wifi that was pretty fast and stable. A good supply of water bottles were provided (replenished daily). So far so good. Strangely, there's a few pots and pans in the cupboard, but no plates or cutlery. Totally weird. Pretty quickly we noticed there were issues with maintenance - pool was green with algae and not fully in service, broken lifts or lifts that wouldn't go to ground floor, broken marble edges in the dining area, a sink that wouldn't drain. The 2 free internet terminals on ground floor didn't work. One inconvenience was that they only gave you a single room card. When your group isn't all together that becomes a drag. We tried out the gym. Small, but functional with new equipment. Having the fridge was great for storing food and drinks, but the room information talked about a minibar, which we never found. By the way, if you don't pay a deposit up front for food and drinks (which noone mentioned) then you won't be able to charge things to your room - you'll need to bring cash or credit with you whenever you order food and drinks from the hotel. The thing that disappointed the most was the breakfast buffet; artificial and bland for the most part. The staff were friendly, but not all spoke English well. The location is a bit off the beaten track, down a long narrow road. Not all taxi drivers know it - it pays to carry a business card from the hotel with the address. There's really nowhere much to safely walk to from the hotel. The hotel offers an hourly shuttle that goes to Seminyak Square, Kuta and Bali Mal Galleria (I think). Taxis are cheap, and the hotel can organise one pretty easily, either for a fixed price, or you can asked for a Bluebird metered taxi. For IDR 50,000 you can get all the way to Kuta. If you need an airport transfer the hotel will do one for IDR 200,000. They managed to squeeze 5 of us and luggage into one car. So overall, some good, some bad. With attention it could be improved. But good value overall for the Family Room.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1989,great pool and service,40,March 2015,"Stayed here 26 nights. when your at this hotel its hard to know your in busy Indonesia, its so quiet and the pool is lovely. I booked this hotel knowing it was some way from town, but as they have a restaurant that didn't bother me. I only ate there 5 nights as the dinner menu was very limited and pricey. We found all the staff great, happy and very helpful. I would stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1990,Ramada Encore Bali overall 4 out of 5,40,April 2015,"Stayed 4 nights April 2015 hotel new and rooms very well appointed. Staff all very young and enthusiastic. Some problems still exist with protocols and language but generally ok . eg: wanted to charge full 4 nights on arrival. Normally 4 star hotels charge 1st night and balance on check out. Here they wanted full payment up front.
2nd problem we had dinner at the hotel and normally one would charge it to The room and again pay on checkout. Not So we had a guy knocking on the door asking for cash for the dinnwe 2 hours later . Yhats not good so we paid on a credit card. Their policies need to change to match ""Normal "" hotel practices.
Rooms well appointed and bathroom a decent size, Aircon worked well and fittings all nice quality. Pool access rooms best if you're a swimmer.
Pool was only about 1 metre deep throughout and no deep end for swimming. Good for little ones but no life guards so adults need to watch their kids. Whole setting is very nice , very modern look to whole hotel but it is a bit off the beaten track in Seminyak . If you want shops around you this is not the place but for peace and quiet and a nice property it is.
Good for mature people (singles and couples ) and not a bogan / yobbo type hotel. Not so good for families as kids club almost non existent.

overall very nice hotel and well priced.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1991,Very recommend for family with children or couple,50,March 2015,Its so amazing and very recommend for staying at Ramada encore. I am still staying here when I write this review... The staff is so helpful and polite.smile. also the staff widi and Eva at restaurant is friendly and helpful. The food also delicious.,Primera Hotel Seminyak
1992,Was nice,30,March 2015,"We stayed here 2 nights during Nyepi Day (Silent Day for Bali), first impression to see the building yes as what we imagine but compare with their stars its disappointing.

Their parking area is quite small and shared with the employees, located outside with some security around, its save to keep your helmet there if you use motorbike though.

The lobby was small and the receptionist was all busy with their computer (of course), due to we were coming at the hectic time, and because of that they did not recognize which come first as the queue line also messy. Come to our turn to check in and the reception was on his straight face without smile. He asked for the amount money to pay without showing the registration or details to reconfirm what we've booked. Few minutes wait he gave us key without give any direction, still okey tough we found our way.

The room was nice, it is modern minimalist, not really big and no bathtub. O yes they have a fridge but its empty. One of the reason why we choose this hotel is because the swimming pool design, but it is annoying because so many kids with their play balloon and so on, but we remember that was Nyepi Day, lots of them escaping from the house with their family lol.

The breakfast just next to the swimming pool, can imagine the parent having breakfast while look after their children playing in the pool. The food was quite nice and enough variety, and the most we loved is the staff there, they all nice and really helpful (it is shame because the receptionist supposed to be more than that).

In the lobby area just in the corner they provided some comfy chairs and billiard table also other game i do not know the name lol. i think it is quite nice for those who prefer to stay at the hotel during the day, they also have pool bar which open since morning until 10:30 pm i think.

Check out process was also long queue, but run smooth. They asked us to wait while they are checking our room, but because we sure that there is nothing there we decided to leave few seconds after.

The security staff all were very polite and smiley.
Nothing to complaint lah.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1993,Needs improvements,20,March 2015,"Some issues we had during our stay: 1) I dropped my friends fiancé first at the lobby and proceeded to park the car. When i came to the lobby and we walked toward sour room my fiancé told me that she were asked by the security personal for her ID credential - absolutely unacceptable treatment! 2) we asked first for a late check out (as out fight out left at evening time) which were rejected with the reason of ""general cleaning"" even though occupancy of the hotel at the time were approximately 40%. We never experience to have this favour rejected in Bali before and were stunned. 3) the amenities were not refilled.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1994,GOOD HOTEL BUT NOT SO GREAT STAFF,30,March 2015,"I booked the room for Nyepi Day, I requested room on the second floor and not far because I come with my kid and they said have blocked it for me however when I checked in, they didn't give us that room, they gave us the room which was in the corner quite far for walk and it was on the third floor. They did not show us the direction to the room so we got lost twice while bringing our bags and had to come back to lobby to ask someone about direction to find our room.

And when I checked out, they asked us to wait for check the room before we're leaving then we waited for 45 minutes and still there was not people informing us whether it is done or not. Then we decided to leave the hotel and ask our car key, anyway the reception kept focus on his computer when we checked out and did not pay attention of us like he's too busy with his job.

But the security guys, they were smiling and helped us with all our bags. Other than that The room, breakfast and pool, are great. Thank you.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1995,lovely new hotel,40,March 2015,"stayed here for 5nights on a deluxe pool access room, loved it!!!! from the fantastic staff always smiling, the beautiful swimming pool, the amazing spa treatment, the comfortable bed and did I mention the fantastic staff?
The place is perfect for us, not to close and not to far... just perfect, and besides they have a free shuttle bus service to the local mall... and taxi's are cheap!!!
The deluxe room is spacious and aircon works well

The location is little isolated however, they provide a free shuttle service whenever you need which is great! Friendly, helpful staff!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1997,March 2015,10,March 2015,"A very disappointing stay to say the least. Nice hotel layout with a great pool as the centrepiece but it's a new hotel and you can tell. Unfortunately we stayed here during the Nyepe holiday, a day of reflection where by law you cannot leave your hotel. Non Hindus tend to take advantage of the special offers so the hotel went from well attended guests to utter chaos with a sudden onslaught of 200 new guests. The hotel was caught out big time. Stuck in our rooms we relied on cable TV. Little did we know they cut off the cable feed as part of the rituals. The only thing to do was watch a series of random DVDs they put on but we had to get them to re-tune the TV first. They cut back the menu to just four dishes. The baby high chairs were always dirty and covered in food scraps. The advertised kids club was an empty unstaffed room with some toys on the floor. The staff were put on double shifts and looked like walking zombies. They ran out of half the meal selections the following day as well as ice!!!! They served me a warm can of soft drink and couldn't understand why I took it back. They ran out of pool towels and their disinterested pool attendants told us to merely use our room towels of which they also ran out. We asked three times to replace the room mini fridge as it wouldn't keep our drinks cold. A fellow guest told me none of the fridges were working properly. It's a couple of k's from the action which is fine but don't rely on the limited shuttle bus. It has a nasty habit of leaving early even if you have booked a seat! Also, if you extend your check out make sure they program your room key to reflect that or you'll end up locked out like us. Staff though are very friendly. They try hard but are let down by management. It's as though they have poached all the junior staff from other hotels and are training them up. We don't mind engagement with staff but it gets a bit much when you realise you are a guinea pig for 'greeting' training and every line of limited English is the same. Rant over. Look we didn't pay a fortune to stay here but it isn't the five star facility it claims to be and we won't be back.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1998,Great Place to be in Seminyak,50,February 2015,"We spent our 3 fabulous nights at this hotel on February at this hotel. The hotel is great, big swimming pool, well manicured garden, the room is really clean and well maintain. The staff friendly and helpful, the food are good but sometimes it takes long time to be ready. The daily buffet breakfast was good and many different choices. The hotel location is great close to everywhere and you can get the taxi easily.

We will definitely come back and stay at this hotel again in the future.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
1999,Awesome...!!!,50,March 2015,"Afforable and great staff. Worth for money and you find yourself centre of the city. Awesome food , facilities and service.

Enjoyed the stay.KUDOS guys",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2000,Affordable in a quiet area,30,March 2015,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel,
nice hotel, but all the finishes are a joke, the shower flooded our bathroom every time we showered, lifts were temperamental with no real alternative exits in the hotel, the only stairs available took you outside. The food was average, catered for more Indonesian cuisine.
Pool was great, bed was nice and big and comfy, location is hidden which was a good thing - peace and quiet from all the traffic

You really do pay for what you get.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2001,Very pleasent stay!,40,March 2015,The staff were fantastic! Especially Evi she went above and beyond. The rooms and hotel is amazing value for money. The only thing that could improve slightly is the food as it was very basic flavours and perhaps a different menu to the room service menu for dinner. All in all I was very pleased and would stay again,Primera Hotel Seminyak
2002,Great staff and value,40,March 2015,"A newly opened hotel with new looking reception area, restaurant and pool. Some of the corridors are more tired looking but the rooms are clean.

The restaurant was good for the buffet breakfast. We also had desserts one evening but they were both awful.

The location isn't perfect, but a R.p.30k taxi will get you into Seminyak.

The big selling points are the price and the friendliness of the staff. Both are great and make this a really good, cheap option in Seminyak.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2003,Melt in your sleep and a place to just to unwind,40,March 2015,"This hotel have the most comfortable bed and pillow from all the hotel that i have stayed all this time. It just make you never want to leave your bed once you lay yourself into it.

2004,Nice and Friendly,50,March 2015,"We spent 7 nights here and found it a very comfortable stay. The staff were friendly and the food was excellent.

The only problem we encountered was the hotel is quite new and a lot of taxi drivers do not know where it is. This of course will change over time.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2005,Awesome accomodation.,50,February 2015,"Loved the room it was really big with a couch and a desk and the hotel facilities were lovely. I sometimes had elephants above me and asians screeming up and down the hallways at all hours and slamming their hotel doors, hotel is only 4 months old. Pool area is awesome. Shame more of them do not speak good english so took a while to get something done as they did not understand, but they were kind and helpful. It was only $10 aust dollars from airport to hotel and a $4-5 trip into Kuta. and $5 to the big shopping centers. they do free trip to Semnyiak square and Kuta, we just have to pay blue taxi for return trip. Food was amazing and cheap at the hotel. Short walk to Mini Mart for chips and drinks.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2006,Excellent hotel for the price,40,February 2015,"I normally stay in villas and when I saw the price of this hotel I couldn't refuse, AUS$66 per night. The hotel had not fully opened but I could not hear any construction noise. The pool is amazing, huge and you didn't feel like you shared it with anybody, I booked a lagoon room with pool access, you do need to be careful when you book these because only a few of the rooms actually have pool access. I did get one and was worth it. The rooms are huge, immaculately clean and I could not fault anything about the room or service from the staff. The breakfast selection was huge and always fresh but was very Asian orientated, which didn't bother me but perhaps would for some people. Overall the hotel was great and I highly recommend this place. Hard to find fault. The drinks from the bar are very reasonably priced compared to other hotels.
Wi-Fi on the other hand hardly worked at all was very frustrating but that is a minor issue. The hotel is removed from the main streets but taxi's are always at reception and I had a scooter so transport was no issue for me
Overall this hotel is really great.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2007,hidden treasure,40,March 2015,"- makesure to have few copies of the address or map printed if you have to go out alone riding a taxi as not many taxi drivers are familiar with the place especially night time
- taxi drivers were a bit hesitant to drive right to the end of the road to the hotel as its a small and winding road also quite dark at night. so imagine if its past midnight or in the wee hours of the morning.
- even a local friend stopped for 5 times asking for direction before he can get to the hotel
- did not get to try the free shuttle but the idea is interesting unless you plan to just rest and laze around the hotel
- the breakfast buffet and the restaurant dining is good
- if budget is not an issue then get yourself the poolview or direct pool access rooms",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The only thing I didn't like, we arrived very late, the check in tooks to long and I don't like to pay, even without seeing my room! We was very tired and happy than to be finally in our room.

2010,A few things 4 star,30,February 2015,"We stayed a total of 6 nights, first booking was for four nights and the second one was for two nights. We tried to extend our booking first through your reception but we got told that you were fully booked so we checked out to then find out online that you still had available rooms, we did not want to move somewhere else do we ended up booking online again and checkin in again. We asked to get the same room 3206 and again we were told you were fully booked. We were returning customers , had to wait two hours to get the room and we ended up getting the same room 3206. Why were we told that room isn't available and after two hours of wait you fave us the room ?? I work in hospitality and this isn't the best way to deal with returning customers, taking into consideration that we had to change rooms before because the air con didn't work and the second one smelled really bad. We got a letter from you saying that we had to check out at twelve because you are fully booked but no one wrote anything apologising that we had to change rooms twice.
We loved staying there after we changed rooms. Pool is very good, gym is good too.
Staff is very friendly and Yudi the gun trainer was very good and helpful.

2013,Nice new hotel,30,February 2015,"Nice hotel, great pool very child friendly, nice room had pool ac room. Bathroom extremly cramped, sitting on toilet your face in bassinet, not ok. Food is something to improve Breakfast incomplete. Butter is advertised but what is served is blueband margarine, shame on you Ramada Encore. A la carte menu ok but food is poor and we ordered for more than 1 million idr during our stay so my judgement justyfied. Staff is generally very friendly and nice. All wear same boring t-shirt so difficult to to tell who work where. Uniforms in a hotel like this should have more caracter and class. Enginering should not have their work place in the parking lot. Housekeeping need further training and supervision, this is the down side on staff performance.
Wi fi slow or not working. A few things to correct and it will be a nice place to visit in the future.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2014,Otherwise a Perfect Stay,40,January 2015,"We booked 3 rooms during our last stay for 2 nights in January 2015. We arrived late in the evening and managed to check in accordingly without a fuss. All of us were hungry and decided to try out the room service and were really surprised that they do take orders even after 11pm. Marvelous, waited for the food to arrive takes them about 15-20minutes and that was fast. The only thing was we have to pay upfront when you order room service which was strange but well, that's fine with us when we talked about it over the breakfast the next morning. We had a really lovely time during our stay and i should say the pool were just marvelous. The staff were all so friendly and helpful although sometimes during the early morning we could hear the staff giggling outside the corridor while pushing the trolley for no apparent reason.

2021,Lovely little find,40,February 2015,"My fiancé and I stayed at the Ramada Encore in Feb 2015. We had a really lovely time and only a few very very minor complaints! The staff were all so friendly and helpful, and although their English might not be completely fluent they speak it very well considering English isn't their first language.

We had booked into the cheapest room at first but it had no balcony and it was right next to the lift which makes a noise every time it gets to a floor (one of the minor complaints we had). By the second day we decided to upgrade to a pool view room and it was the best thing we did all holiday! The second room was really spacious and we loved having a balcony.

We used the gym every day and the instructor (Yudi) was very knowledgeable and attentive. The gym has good machines and one yoga type mat. There's also a really cool little kids play room right opposite the gym.

The pool signs say its only open from 8-8 but we saw people in the pool until about 9 so I don't think it's a hard and fast rule.

The hotel generally is clean and has lots of little chill out areas which was nice when we didn't have a bigger room or a balcony.

The food is good, and so we're the cocktails.

It's about a 15 min walk to the main shopping streets in seminyak across a few very busy roads but they offer a free shuttle from about 9-5pm any time you need it so that want a problem at all.

The gardens are so beautiful and look so well established considering the hotel is so new!

2022,The Ultimate holiday destination,50,February 2015,"A dream holiday. We ventured to a brand new resort in the peaceful upmarket Seminyak with 2 parents and 3 late teens and a lot of conflicting reviews. However, upon arrival, our concerns were put at ease with a wonderful spacious modern hotel greeting us. We booked in to the Premier Family Lagoon direct pool access rooms and it felt as comfortable and luxurious as a 5 star hotel. The views and access to the 2200m2 pool is amazing with food and beverage service pool side. A regular free shuttle service is available or ulternatively a $4 taxi ride to Kuta can be swiftly arranged. The buffet breakfast offers a vast variety of cereal, fruits and dishes. Every stone has been unturned to provide the most relaxing but entertaining holiday from the well equipped gym and instructor, Yudi, day spa, pool table and internet lounge. The Hotel Manager, Mr Madi, was a fantastic host who leads an energetic and youthful team ready to make your stay the most comfortable possible.

2023,Excellent Hotel & Service; Quiet Location,50,February 2015,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Ramada Encore in Seminyak. We were a bit weary of the location having read reviews that it was far away from everything, but there is a free shuttle to Seminyak Square and Kuta everyday and all the taxi services know where it is so you have no problem getting back at night (and it only costs a few dollars).

The hotel staff was excellent and very accommodating. The facilities are great and there is a gym and spa located at the hotel and both are excellent and well organized. The buffet breakfast was also great and featured both Indonesian and Western breakfast food, and the hotel restaurant had decent food as well. We ate at the restaurant for Balinese food night which we highly recommend - they create a buffet with traditional dishes and the chef comes out and explains what he cooked and asks how you like it.

The bed was honestly one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.

2026,Great value for money...,50,February 2015,"I recently went to Bali for a short trip as a single person and this new hotel (Nov 2014) was perfect for that. As it was just me, I went for the basic room which was perfect. I loved the fact that the shower wasn't over a bath and there was no grimy shower curtain to wrestle with. The air-con worked well, but I had a window I could open at night and the sheer curtains did not allow mosquitoes to enter the room, so I was able to turn the air-con off.
Breakfast buffet was plentiful with a good selection and was different both days. The pool was lovely, and the rooms overlooking it or with pool access would certainly be the pick. There were shuttle buses to Kuta twice daily and to Seminyak every hour. I did Bluebird cabs as that fitted in with my timing better but it was only about $5 AUD from Kuta and the minimum cab fare of $3 AUD from Bintang supermarket in Seminyak. It was a little way away from the action, but so simple to get anywhere quickly. If you ring reception before leaving your room they will organize a Bluebird cab for you - which you will not have to wait long for. The cost for my room, inc breakfast for 2 (I had to pay for double of course) was still significantly less than my cab fare to Perth airport. I would definitely stay here again.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Food was good with an affordable price and was also served very well. Restaurant was an open air and had very nice design, combination of modern and vintage. The pool was big enough with many sun lounger. Nice and large room with large balcony/patio, but a tad smaller bathroom. Good value because we were there during opening promo, we got a good discount. Tried their spa and had a nice massage by an experience masseur/therapist. Unfortunately when we were there the spa rooms were not ready yet so we were escorted into a room that was prepared as a temporary spa room.

2029,Recent stay at Seminyak Encore Ramada,40,February 2015,"When we first drove towards the hotel we were quite worried as the surrounding area seemed not a place where I would locate a hotel. However, it soon became clear that the area is quite safe. The room was very clean and very quite environment and had everything we would have wanted. However, a little more space would have been appreciated. The view was not so great but as we were only to use the room to sleep in it was OK.
The staff were wonderful, most friendly and helpful and it seems went out of their way to assist the patrons. I had asked if they could arrange for some flowers to be delivered to my wife for her birthday. They excelled in n that they produced the most beautiful pair of swans using white towels and spread red rose petals including the words Happy Birthday on our bed. Amazing stuff. They also produced a wonderful birthday cake and sang Happy Birthday to my wife at 10.00 pm when we returned to the hotel after a tiring day out.
We really could not have asked for more. I had cheekily asked the Manager for catering if they had fired bananas. They next day they surprised me with fried bananas as a treat.
Having stayed in several 5 star hotels, I will rate this stay the best experience of all. The catering facilities was excellent as was the range of meals they offered. Really must thank the management and the staff for making our stay their hotel the best experience. My wife and I will return to this hotel if we are to visit Bali again which we will.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2030,Do not stay here!!!!,10,December 2014,"Thanks to the incompetant staff , I had to leave bali with half my clothes. Knowingly that I had to get a taxi at 5am . Tahey ensured me that my laundry will be ready. Without me knowing they sent my laundry to a random shop where it was never returned and never heard back from them as gain when they ensured they would post it to me. And still made me pay for laundry if I wanted it posted . Worst service ever.
plus wifi took 2 hours to set up and hard to find
do not stay here!!!!!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2031,Best value in Seminyak,50,January 2015,"We stayed at Encore for 13 nights and did not want to leave.
I traveled with wife and 18 month old baby.
We had low expectations for the area and and average for service before we came. However after one night we already felt at home.
Here are the great things:
1. breakfast is from 6am to 10:30 and food options are excellent even for a dinner standard
2. staff is super-friendly and happy to be there.
3. guests are generally low key yet well traveled and can see the value
4. they provide shuttle to beach and shopping, if requested they can use hotel car to assist you.
5. there is a great spa within 100 meters
6. the pool is amazing
7. you can actually walk with stroller in the neighbourhood
8. furniture and appliances are new and up to date

there are more good thing to say but i'd like to leave some for you to discover",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2032,"Worth the money, Good Job!",50,January 2015,"Room for improvement:
1. Swimming pool close too early, should extend till 10 or 11pm
2. Spa service should extend till 9 or 10pm
3. Checking out process should reduce to 5min instead of 15 to 20 mins bcoz some travellers are rushing to airport
4. Wifi connection is sometimes inconsistent.

Nevertheless, the food is nice and all staff are very friendly.swimming pool is great too except it close 8pm (too early). Overall, I'm very satisfied with this hotel. Good Job!",Primera Hotel Seminyak

2034,great place!,40,January 2015,"We stayed at the encore for 6 nights and loved it. pool was great. Staff were friendly. Facilities were great. I would definitely stay here again! Only negative was that you have to book a taxi and pay extra for it, unless you were willing to walk a little bit. Also because the hotel is new grab a business card to show taxi drivers or learn a hotel near by.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2035,Good hotel,40,January 2015,"I stayed at this hotel from 24th jan 15. For 6 nights it is worth the money, only downside is it's a long way out from seminyak. And there are no shops near by the staff were fantastic. And the pool is excellent very clean hotel and room I stayed in 1309. It was good next too pool. . The food for breakfast could be better choice for western people. If I was asked too stay here again I would. It's a good hotel overall",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2036,Excellent and beautiful hotel with lovely staff,50,January 2015,"We were supposed to only stay one night at Ramada Encore Seminyak and travel to different areas in Bali after that, but with the great service, rooms, restaurant and pool area, we decided to stay a whole week at Ramada Encore Seminyak! The staff was always friendly and helpful with questions concerning where to go when in Bali, and with helping to get transport to different places (we had the same chauffeur for the whole week who was very friendly too!). The prices for rooms, and in the restaurant and the bar, were also very good. We got upgraded to a room with a terrace from where you got directly to the pool, which was super nice!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2037,Nice new hotel,40,January 2015,"We spend 2 nights here, and we liked it. It's really good value for your money (around €30 on agoda) since the rooms are clean and big and the bed and pillows VERY comfy. Good WiFi in the rooms, and a lot of tv channels if you want to watch a movie. The pool is also great and a very extensive breakfast buffet is included. Since the hotel is brand new, they are still finishing up some rooms but we were not bothered by that. Read several comments saying the language barrier is an issue, but in my opinion they are really trying their best to have a conversation with you in English so they are working on it! The hotel is a bit far from the center and beach but a taxi only costs max 20.000 Rp and the hotel has a free drop-off shuttle.
As a point of improvement: I would suggest not to play house music during dinner, it's a bit out of place :)",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2038,Nice hotel and friendly staff,50,December 2014,"Me and my friends stayed here for 1 night and we booked 2 rooms. First We came here all staff greet with cute smile, friendly and very warm welcome. Yippy we've got welcome drinks and relax for a while in sofa. the room and toilet was clean, nice. Bed very comfy with lots of pillow (loved it), lots of television channel, good furnished, good wifi. Beside restaurant and cafe there a large swimming pool with tropical garden, pool was clean, lot with lazy sun bath chairs and i enjoyed much. One thing i didnt like is parking area maybe still unfinished works but need improvement from the floor and better plant the trees in this area. Definitely will be back again on april",Primera Hotel Seminyak

2041,need better service,30,January 2015,"It was difficult to find the hotel because the gogle map gave a wrong direction
When we got to the room they gave the wrong one ( we asked for twin it was double) so we had to go back to the reception
Finally they gave us twin bed but the room was so far away from the lift eventhough i was sure the rooms are not full they only open for 1 month and they know we were tired
When we call room service to order food they said we can not because they still served buffet dinner but at last they agreed to send us beef sandwich after my staff short of beg them since i was very hungry and cranky
The swimming pool was nice by the way",Primera Hotel Seminyak

2043,"Good, but still learning",40,January 2015,"Our stay at the Ramada was greeted with friendly staff who were almost too helpful. When booking here do keep in mind that the hotel is only a couple of months old. We stayed in a superior room with it overlooking the paddock next door. The room service was an added bonus and the food still lacking in the execution department, raw chicken and beef in the burger. Breakfast was nice, combination of hot and continental food avaliable. Beer is cheap ~$2.80 aud.

Our toilet packed up 4 days in and would no longer flush and the sheets we arrived to were dirty (had some hardened brown matter on them :s nonetheless they were changed the next day with replacement sheets slightly less dirty, still had some marks on them.

Still giving them the benefit of the doubt the pool (oh my god the pool was amazing), gym and overall ambience of the place is perfect (was nearly deserted when we went there) for a getaway to bali with all the luxuries and low cost.

It is slightly out of the way but it was a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of kuta and seminyak

Special shout out to youdi the gym instructor who was very friendly",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2044,Not the best place to stay in Bali,20,January 2015,"Even though the hotel seems new and the swimming pool is amazing, i wouldnt go back. The staff are constantly harassing you to check if you pay for whatever service you require. The music of the hotel is the same, they play the same 4 songs over and over again. Breakfast is very average and the hotel is far from town or the beach, our native taxi driver couldnt even find it. Yes, the hotel is cheap but there are other places where you can stay for the same money. The staff hardly spoke english which is strange cos in other hotels we stayed they all did.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

Shame i must upgrade to deluxe room in the next day but the room ready on 3 pm. The wash basin in new room was clogging. info right away to the hotel when i went out to the hotel to fix it but when i came back to the hotel at midnight they never fix it. The water still there. Call to the FO but the maintenance never come then i need to fix it by myself. Booked taxi but the taxi never come when check to FO they mention never get info to booked the taxi. Very poor services. I already pay the upgrade room but they mention never get the payment... The staff need to get training...

2049,Headache after headache,20,December 2014,"We experienced problem after problem with our stay here from the check-in process to the air-con not working to the restaurant not having over half the menu available.
The staff have had minimal or no training and spoke very little english, there was a handful of english speaking staff members but finding them was near impossible.

The rooms at Ramada Encore are great as is the pool and restaurant but the rest of the hotel just isn't finished, the staff training, english barrier, unfinished facilities and the location really let this place down.
The Spa isn't ready neither is the gym, the kids club and most rooms on levels 4 & 5 so the place is still heavily under construction, being so far away from the main road a taxi needs to be called to the hotel every time you want to go out unless you make the 5-10min walk to the main road each time.

Overall as regular visitors to Bali we had a bad experience at Ramada Encore and will never stay at this hotel again as there is literally too many issues to list, the above is only a basic rundown of our stay.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

It was also a great bonus to have the welcome drinks, lots of smiles, and no uncomfortable waiting around by the porters for tips. We collapsed into the king size bed and sunk our heads into the cloud soft pillows to wake refreshed in the morning. There was an issue with having no hot water which was attended to and fixed within ten minutes We have just returned from breakfast which was more than adequate but quite basic - no hams of cheeses and basic pastries. On the plus side lots of fresh fruit, eggs to order and lots of fillers like rice and noodles. We are just at the start of a five day stay but if the standard continues as is we would be more than happy to recommend it.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

The room is clean, and i give 2 thumbs up for the bed and the pillow... sooo comfy, it made me dont wanna to get up from the bed. But the minus thing is for the location, you should have your own vehicle or rent a car or rent a motorcycle... because this hotel is far from tourist attraction. About the breakfast, is quit good with various of choice.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2053,This hotel should not be open yet,10,December 2014,"Stayed here from the 27th of December to the 2nd of January. Where do I start. Upon arrival we were welcomed by staff who appeared to have little or no English skills. We were friends booking two separate rooms. We ventured to the first room to take a look and noticed that the Aircon unit was not working although everything else seemed fine. Went to the second room which was identical but a very long walk from the elevator. Upon opening the door a hugely pungent smell wafted from the room. It was unbearable. The staff must have been aware of the smell as the electrical card key was sellotaped into the holder and aircon was full blast. When we went down to complain about the smell they said they would sort the room we advised that we would be going to dinner and to have this sorted when we returned. Upon arrival back from dinner the room was still not sorted. The staff were very busy and very hard to understand. They appeared to have little or no training. In the lobby was numerous other guests complaining of room bookings also. Another room was found but it had two single beds and I was advised it could not be rectified to make one bed that night but when housekeeping came the next day it would be changed. The next morning I requested it to be changed and upon returning from the day it still was not changed. After two more requests and this not being completed I stood at the front desk and stated that I would not move until house keeping had changed the bed setting to one bed instead of two singles in which they finally managed to rectify. At this time they also advised they did not have any blankets in that bed size left so I had the large bed but small blanket which was throughout the trip and remained unchanged. We had countless other problems. It appears that when you put ""Do not disturb"" on your door handle that housekeeping still proceeded to ring your outside bell in the morning and try the door. Also at 10:30 am right before breakfast was ending they would call my room every day to advise me if I hadn't made it. This was very annoying especially since I was usually sleeping and the ringing of the telephone was so loud it echoed throughout the room. Room service on numerous occasions took over an hour to deliver, even for drinks or ice. The restaurant was not equipped to run over a busy period. They ran out of heaps of items on the menu including drinks. Also my friend had an issue with his key and when he had asked one of the cleaners in the hall about the key issue instead of checking with the front desk the house keeper swiped his key and let my friend in with no questions asked. That room also had an issue with the door where it would not close properly and we would come back from our travels in the day to find the cleaners hadn't pulled the door shut tight and it would be wide open.
Room Tips
- The large bed is actually two singles pushed together
- Ground floor rooms on the right hand side of the hotel are next to an empty lot so prepare to stuff a towel against the door to stop bugs from entering
- Hotel is still very new, some floors aren't finished work is still going on here
- No spa yet (assume that's still being built)
- Staff have very bad English
- Always have the address handy when getting a taxi here as it is so new some taxi drivers are unaware of it
- The finishings of this hotel are poor for a brand new hotel
- Laundry that was done was covered in powder
- The wi-fi was so poor

Positive things about this hotel
- The pool is huge but as the rooms are around the pool be prepared to hear all the noise.
- the pillows on the beds were so lush and amazing and also the beds were so soft it was heaven sleeping on them.
- Rooms are a good size
- The room amenities you are provided are plentiful, including shaving pack, dental kit, comb etc.

Overall I would never stay at this hotel again. It was a real struggle to understand why this hotel had opened this early. The service was so poor. Everything you asked for seemed so painful to achieve which created so much undue stress. There are much better places to stay in Seminyak.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2054,Good value,40,January 2015,The hotel offers clean and good value 3 star rooms which have a quite new feel. It's 20mins walking to the heart of seminyak and a motor bike or taxi is the best option for transport (only 5mins to beach). Gym was very basic but much better than expected at such limited service properties. The hotel did not feel crowded at this time of the year and have to agree that staff is still a bit unexperienced although service oriented. I agree with previous poster that breakfast is more targeted to Asian audience but didn't feel that as a major drawback.,Primera Hotel Seminyak

2056,New Hotel with Potential,40,December 2014,"This hotel only opened in December 2014 and apart from a few teething problems offers a great resort experience away from the crowds. The lagoon swimming pool is great for both families and couples wanting to relax. The bridge walkway over the pool seems to separate the adults from the kids. A number of rooms on the ground floor have balconies that walk straight into the pool. Consider 1317-1320 as rooms with pool access from the balcony. Rooms are modern and well appointed. The buffet food including breakfast is okay and only improved during our ten day stay. At first the buffet ran out of food in the mornings because the hotel wasn't prepared for the crowds, but this was quickly fixed. The location can be a problem and some taxi drivers can't find it. I would recommend you organize a personal driver and vehicle for your stay there. The hotel shuttle was not reliable but the manger told us that more shuttle services/vehicles were being organized. A walk down the road and we found transport services much quicker than waiting at the hotel. When dealing with hotel staff, you have to be really sure they understand you as English is not a strong point. Lots of nods and smiles and the message hasn't been understood. But overall the price is great and a relaxing place to stay where the hotel staff and management are really trying their best to please.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2057,Confused,30,December 2014,"stayed here for 1 night and couldn't agree more with few advise guest comment on Tripadvisor.
First, i really in love with the hotels location,quite not really busy hustle like in center of Seminyak. The bed very comfortable even i request for king size bed but they don't have it. The pool very nice pool with lots of sun!the pillow its feels like same in my own bedroom at home.
The negative things are the breakfast is a totally mess,they just set up the food every where not in 1 place/ 1 buffet. the dirty plate in every table no one clean it up. the staff not professional yet ,but they willing to help,they eager to fulfilled your request but extremely need an extra training. They just don't know what the next to do seems like they are confused. Been many times call the reception but no one pick up my phone till 10 times or more to have an extra towel since i stay with my friend and no mineral water at room even i check in at 10 pm. When checked out time they wants us to wait for checking room as usual in every hotel but they just let me waiting till more than 15 minutes and no information and we just go.
I understand the case is this hotel just newly open for 1 month but you have to prepare everything before you are confidence to open the hotel for your next loyal customer.

2058,Fawlty Towers in Seminyak!,10,January 2015,"This place is a shambles and shouldn't be open. It may be cheap, but it is for a reason! Our first room the fuse kept blowing. We had no lights, air con or TV for 3 hours. It took 10 calls and 3 trips from reception to then get us to change rooms. The next room had a leaking toilet - gross! We let reception know again, but they did nothing about it. The English of the staff we spoke to in every department (front desk, restaurant etc) was very poor, even for basic terms. Worse than anywhere we visited in 2.5 weeks in Indonesia. There were numerous administrative errors which were near impossible to resolve with the poor English - from being double charged for breakfast to just getting a message left for a friend in another room.

The breakfast included may be a banquet but is clearly for an Asian audience. Curry chicken, noodles, rice etc for breakfast.

It is clear this place opened in a hurry without sufficient training. It's a long way off being ready to be open to public.",Primera Hotel Seminyak

2061,not the beset,30,December 2014,"negative:
It says it has free shuttle service to Seminyak, but please note it is only 2 times a day. My first day they didnt offer anything. This was one of the main reasons why I booked the hotel in the first place. It is far from the beach, and you are dependent on transportation to everything. It was also long waiting time every time to get a taxi as everybody on the hotel was dependent on taxi.

It is no eating places near the hotel. As it is painful to get taxi, you are often stuck in the hotel. However in the evening, the hotel has very little food to offer. I had to go for a buffet for $10, and it was nothing left. However i was stuck in the hotel and had not much choice.

In the morning there are a bunch of kids cleaning the room. They laugh and joke. I dont mind people having fun, and to be happy, but it is very noisy every morning. It feels like somebody having a party outside your door every morning.

the bathroom was not clean when I checked in at 7pm.

Breakfast buffet is nothing special

Positive:
Rooms are nice, big and modern.
It is a very quiet location, so sleep is good
It is not too expensice
staff is friendly (but perhaps lacking some skills)
Lounge and lobby area is moderen and nice
free wifi

Maybe not my first choice if I go to Bali again, but will consider it if some of the above problems will be fixed.",Primera Hotel Seminyak
2062,Perfect family hotel with friendly price,50,January 2015,We saw this hotel from booking.com and was surprised because of the price. Its considered cheap for a Bali standard 4 star hotel inclusive of breakfast. We book 2 connecting rooms and found the room was very clean and comfortable. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and what we love most is the balcony facing the lagoon swimming pool. My children love the swimming pool so much because its quite large. And parents can watch the children swim while do some relax reading from the room's balcony. A perfect place to relax and unwind from the busy crowded place in Bali. The breakfast was relatively complete and have many selections. The staffs all are very helpful and friendly. The only draw back was this hotel is very new so we still cannot use the spa facilities and kids club. Very recommended hotel for those who doesnt like the crowded place of Kuta like me :-),Primera Hotel Seminyak

It was New Year time, driving around was crazy jammed and the taxi in bali was impossible, this hotel is well located if you like Seminyak area. My room was in the corner facing the pool.

2064,my new best choice at the south,50,December 2014,"+ cleanliness.
+ had one of the best sleep during last months.
+ nice relaxing restaurant.
- it is hardly can be sad that the room was ""facing the pool"" (additional cost) it was actually was ""facing the roof"", to see the pool you had to come right to the window and look to the right.
- there were no bathrobes (were at the description) but it was compensated by free late checkout.
- as usually at Bali you have to tell the story (about the missing bathrobes) again and again if the staff at the reception is changed (come tomorrow, there is no manager today..), and the staff first says that there should be no bathrobes at all than you have to show them the description (i do not understand why they do not want tho check it themselves)",Primera Hotel Seminyak

It's a new hotel, so expect some teething problems- bring your own coffee as there was none available- breakfast was a mess- empty everything, including plates, cutlery, fruit and more. tables not cleared- flies followed- a bit disappointing as it shouldn't be hard to find junior staff to clear tables- especially where wages are So little in Bali- only two staff on the floor at breakfast time in such a big hotel?! Housekeeping could use a checklist also to ensure little things are not forgotten.

Facilities are good- all these issues fixable with some planning and staffing- surely an international chain can offer some traineeships to recruit more staff?

Where coffee machines break- offer alternatives- like delicious Bali coffee perhaps?
Suggest a mini mart on site also, as it is quite far from anywhere- and traffic is shocking at times.

Great wifi and a top spot to relax. We secured a good rate, and I'd stay again- though would BYO coffee and breakkie!",Primera Hotel Seminyak
